human growth hormone, is secreted by the anterior pituitary. It stimulates bone and cartilage

7. B. It is a myth that alcohol warms the body. As a result of vasodilation, blood flow to the extremities is increased.
This may make hands and feet feel warmer temporarily, but the total surface area of blood exposed to the
surroundings increases, and this results in a loss of heat. As a result, your body temperature, especially of critical
internal organs, will drop.
8. D. Gas exchange in human lungs is not aided by countercurrent exchange. The arteries and veins in the legs of
wading birds and in the fins and tails of marine mammals are closely parallel so that heat transfer from outgoing
arteries to incoming veins is maximized. Similarly, the direction of blood flow through blood vessels in gills is
opposite to that of the water. Also, the loop of Henle maximi
