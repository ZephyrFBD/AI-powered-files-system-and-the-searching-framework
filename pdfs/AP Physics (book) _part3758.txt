FIGURE 33–29 (Repeated.) Compressed graphical representation 
of the development of the universe after the Big Bang,
according to modern cosmology.
Meanwhile, during the next few minutes, crucial events were taking place.
Beginning about 2 or 3 minutes after the Big Bang, nuclear fusion began to
occur. The temperature had dropped to about 
corresponding to an aver-
age kinetic energy 
where nucleons could strike each other and be
able to fuse (Section 31–3), but now cool enough so newly formed nuclei would
not be immediately broken apart by subsequent collisions. Deuterium, helium,
and very tiny amounts of lithium nuclei were made. But the universe was cooling
too quickly, and larger nuclei were not made. After only a few minutes, probably not
even a quarter of an hour after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped far enough
