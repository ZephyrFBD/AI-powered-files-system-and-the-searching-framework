hen the concentrations in 
the two half-cells become the same, Q = 1 and E = 0.
The idea of generating a potential by a concentration difference is the basis for 
the operation of pH meters. It is also a critical aspect in biology. For example, nerve 
cells in the brain generate a potential across the cell membrane by having different 
concentrations of ions on the two sides of the membrane. Electric eels use cells called 
electrocytes that are based on a similar principle to generate short, but intense, pulses 
of electricity to stun prey and dissuade predators (Figure 20.15). The regulation of 
the heartbeat in mammals, as discussed in the following Chemistry and Life box, is 
another example of the importance of electrochemistry to living organisms.
