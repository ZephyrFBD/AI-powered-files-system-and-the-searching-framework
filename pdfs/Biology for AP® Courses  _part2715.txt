eine is one example) or the lethargy associated with opioids. Some compounds become toxic after ingestion; for
instance, glycol cyanide in the cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion by the herbivore.
Mechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at
sites farther from the injury location. Some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours. The infected
and surrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection.
Long-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator. As tissue is damaged, jasmonates may
promote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators. Jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds
that attract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their
host. The plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair.
