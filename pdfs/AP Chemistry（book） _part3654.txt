oms or ions are randomly oriented 
and constantly changing direction, as shown in Figure 23.6(a). 
When a paramagnetic substance is placed in a magnetic field, 
however, the magnetic moments tend to align parallel to one 
another, producing a net attractive interaction with the magnet. 
Thus, unlike a diamagnetic substance, which is weakly repulsed 
by a magnetic field, a paramagnetic substance is attracted to a 
magnetic field.
When you think of a magnet, you probably picture a simple 
iron magnet. Iron exhibits ferromagnetism, a form of magne-
tism much stronger than paramagnetism. Ferromagnetism arises 
when the unpaired electrons of the atoms or ions in a solid are 
influenced by the orientations of the electrons in neighboring

Describe how the representation shown for the paramagnetic 
material would change if the material were placed in a 
magnetic field.
Antiferromagnetic; spins 
align in opposite directions 
and cancel each other
Ferrimagnetic; unequal spins align
