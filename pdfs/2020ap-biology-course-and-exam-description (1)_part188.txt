IST-4.B.1
Changes in genotype may affect phenotypes 
that are subject to natural selection. Genetic 
changes that enhance survival and reproduction 
can be selected for by environmental 
conditions—
a.	The horizontal acquisitions of genetic 
information primarily in prokaryotes via 
transformation (uptake of naked DNA), 
transduction (viral transmission of genetic 
information), conjugation (cell-to-cell 
transfer of DNA), and transposition 
(movement of DNA segments within and 
between DNA molecules) increase variation. 
b.	 Related viruses can combine/recombine genetic 
information if they infect the same host cell.
c.	 Reproduction processes that increase genetic 
variation are evolutionarily conserved and are 
shared by various organisms.
