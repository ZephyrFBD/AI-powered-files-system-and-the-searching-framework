g against the common traits.
In the wild, many species of weeds occur in a range of heights, but tall forms predominate. Because of disruptive
selection, however, only very short forms of these same weeds occur in lawns. On lawns, short weeds are selectively
advantageous because they escape mowing. Weeds in the wild are primarily tall because tallness makes them better
competitors for sunlight.
4. Sexual selection is the differential mating of males (sometimes females) in a population. Since females usually
make a greater energy investment in producing offspring than males, they can increase their fitness by increasing the
quality of their offspring by choosing superior males. Males, on the other hand, contribute little energy to the
production of offspring and thus increase their fitness by maximizing the quantity of offspring produced. Thus, traits
(physical qualities or behaviors) that allow males to increase their mating frequency have a selective advantage and,
as a result, increa
