scent.
(D)
This option is incorrect because there is no evidence that the genes encoding 
FtsZ protein and tubulin are identical. In fact, the data state that the proteins are 
structurally similar, which implies some variance, which also would require a 
variance in gene sequences.
Question 21
Essential Knowledge
2.D.2: Homeostatic mechanisms reflect both common 
ancestry and divergence due to adaptation in different 
environments.
Science Practice
7.1: The student can connect phenomena and models 
across spatial and temporal scales.
Learning Objective 
2.27: The student is able to connect differences in 
the environment with the evolution of homeostatic 
mechanisms.
(A)
This option is incorrect because fish, along with all organisms, consume food 
containing proteins and nucleic acids â€” both nitrogenous compounds.
(B)
This option is correct. There is no need to convert ammonia to urea because it 
can be excreted often in dilute, nontoxic concentrations. This process requires 
less en
