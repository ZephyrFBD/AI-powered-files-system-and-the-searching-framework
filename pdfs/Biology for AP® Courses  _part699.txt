Objective
2.1 The student is able to explain how biological systems use free energy based on empirical
data that all organisms require constant energy input to maintain organization, to grow, and
to reproduce.
The Science Practices Assessment Ancillary contains additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:
[APLO 2.2][APLO 4.14][APLO 2.7][APLO 2.35]
Even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed. However,
consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than
their reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such
