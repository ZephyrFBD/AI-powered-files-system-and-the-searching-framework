78. Two converging lenses, one with
and the other
with
are made into a telescope. (a) What are
the length and magnification? Which lens should be the
eyepiece? (b) Assume these lenses are now combined to
make a microscope; if the magnification needs to be 
how long would the microscope be?
79. An X-ray tube operates at 95 kV with a current of 25 mA
and nearly all the electron energy goes into heat. If the
specific heat of the 0.065-kg anode plate is 
what will be the temperature rise per minute if no cooling
water is used? (See Fig. 25–36.)
80. Human vision normally covers an angle of roughly 40°
horizontally. A “normal” camera lens then is defined as
follows: When focused on a
