storm. When you last stopped,
you noticed that the snow was coming down vertically, but
it is passing the windows of the moving car at an angle of
7.0° to the horizontal. Estimate the speed of the vertically
falling snowflakes relative to the ground. [Hint: Construct
a relative velocity diagram similar to Fig. 3–29 or 3–30. Be
careful about which angle is the angle given.]

A space shuttle 
is carried out into space by 
powerful rockets. They are 
accelerating, increasing in 
speed rapidly. To do so,
a force must be exerted on 
them according to Newton’s 
second law,
What exerts this force? The 
rocket engines exert a force 
on the gases they push out
