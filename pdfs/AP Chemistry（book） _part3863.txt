ol is not only ineffective as a bronchodilator but also actually counters 
the effects of (R)-albuterol. As another example, the nonsteroidal analgesic ibuprofen is 
a chiral molecule usually sold as the racemic mixture. However, a preparation consist-
ing of just the more active enantiomer, (S)-ibuprofen (Figure 24.15(b)), relieves pain and 
reduces inflammation more rapidly than the racemic mixture. For this reason, the chiral 
version of the drug may in time come to replace the racemic one.

If you replace Br with CH3, will the compound be chiral?
