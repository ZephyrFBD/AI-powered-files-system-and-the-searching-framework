scopic world to the tiny microscopic world of
the atom. And there is no reason to expect that these models somehow reflect the
reality of an electron. We thus use a wave or a particle model (whichever works
best in a situation) so that we can talk about what is happening. But we should not
be led to believe that an electron is a wave or a particle. Instead we could say that
an electron is the set of its properties that we can measure. Bertrand Russell said
it well when he wrote that an electron is “a logical construction.”
