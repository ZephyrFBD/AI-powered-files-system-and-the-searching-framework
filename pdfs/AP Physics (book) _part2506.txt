is nearly a“point source”) casts distinct shadows, and the beam from
a laser pointer appears to be a straight line. In fact, we infer the positions of objects
in our environment by assuming that light moves from the object to our eyes in
straight-line paths. Our orientation to the physical world is based on this assumption.
This reasonable assumption is the basis of the ray model of light. This model
assumes that light travels in straight-line paths called light rays. Actually, a ray is
an idealization; it is meant to represent an extremely narrow beam of light. When
we see an object, according to the ray model, light reaches our eyes from each point
on the object. Although light rays leave each point in many different directions,
normally only a small bundle of these rays can enter the pupil of an observer’s
eye, as shown in Fig. 23–1. If the person’s head moves to one side, a different
bundle of rays will enter the eye from each point.
We saw in Chapter 22 that light can be considere
