fferent sizes of food.
For this question, separate your answer into two parts, a and b. In part a, define a prezygotic isolating mechanism,
list the different forms that it can take (habitat, temporal, behavioral, mechanical, and gametic) and provide an
example of each. In part b of your answer, define postzygotic mechanism, follow with the different forms (hybrid
inviability, hybrid sterility, and hybrid breakdown), and provide an example of each.
Question 4
a. A geographic barrier separates a population into groups between which gene flow cannot occur. Once
geographically isolated, the evolution of the two new populations may differ. For example, natural selection in one
group may be different from that of the other group because their habitats differ. Resources, such as food or water,
or predation may differ. Also, mutations in each group may be different. Over time, the two groups may become so
different that they cannot (or will not) reproduce with each other even if the barrier i
