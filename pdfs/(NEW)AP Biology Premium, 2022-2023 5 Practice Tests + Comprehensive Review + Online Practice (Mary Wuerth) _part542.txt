othermic animals have an increased respiration
rate at higher, not lower, temperatures. Choice (C) is incorrect because while species X’s oxygen consumption
at 30°C is closer to that of the rat than to that of the grasshopper, that does not determine whether or not species
X is endothermic. Endothermic animals have higher metabolic rates at lower temperatures (so they can maintain
a constant internal temperature). Therefore, choice (D) is also incorrect.
10. (D) At a higher temperature, the respiration rate of ectotherms (the grasshopper and species X, in this example)
increases and the respiration rate of endotherms (the rat, in this example) decreases. Choice (A) is incorrect
because rats are endothermic. Species X is most likely ectothermic, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is
incorrect because rats are endothermic, not ectothermic, and species X is most likely ectothermic.
