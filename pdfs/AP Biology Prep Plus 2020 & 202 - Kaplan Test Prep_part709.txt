ches on the mainland have a broad range of beak sizes, from
very small to very large. Over time, ecologists notice the
appearance of several new traits in the island finch population.
One of these traits is a small beak, which is eﬀective at obtaining
food from sources that large-beaked finches overlook. Which of
the following is the most reasonable hypothesis regarding the
appearance of this new trait?
The visitors feed the birds, allowing the population of finches
to expand and diversify.
(A)
The boats pollute the island, causing mutations in the finch
population.
(B)
The boats also carry mainland finches, adding new genes to
the gene pool.
(C)
Extensive tourism destroys the finches’ habitat, exerting a
selective pressure to adapt.
(D)
3. Researchers have been interested in understanding diﬀerences
between Tibetan chickens, which live at very high altitudes, and
lowland chickens, which do not. In one study, researchers
examined the frequencies of several single nucleotide
