dard entropy 
changes for systems undergoing reaction, 
using tabulated standard molar entropies.
 19.5 ▶  Gibbs Free Energy Learn that another 
thermodynamic state function, free energy 
(or Gibbs free energy), is a measure of how 
far removed a system is from equilibrium. 
The change in free energy measures the 
maximum amount of useful work obtainable 
from a process and tells us the direction in 
which a chemical reaction is spontaneous.
 19.6 ▶  Free Energy and Temperature  
Consider how the relationship among 
free-energy change, enthalpy change, and 
entropy change provides insight into how 
temperature affects the spontaneity of a 
process.
 19.7 ▶  Free Energy and the Equilibrium 
Constant Examine how the standard 
free-energy change for a chemical reaction 
can be used to calculate the equilibrium 
constant for the reaction.
