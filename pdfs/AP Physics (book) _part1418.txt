mes from measurements. The mole’s
precise definition is the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12 
(page 360).
Equivalently, 1 mol is that amount of substance whose mass in grams is
numerically equal to the molecular mass of the substance (Section 13–1). For
example, the mass of 1 mole of 
is
because carbon
has atomic mass of 12 and oxygen 16 (see Periodic Table inside the rear cover).
In general, the number of moles, n, in a given sample of a pure substance is
equal to the mass of the sample in grams divided by the molecular mass specified
as grams per mole:
For example, the number of moles in 132 g of 
(molecular mass 44 u) is
n =
132 g
44 gmol = 3.0 mol.

We can now write the proportion above 
as an equation:
(13;3)
where n represents the number of moles and R is the constant of proportionality.
