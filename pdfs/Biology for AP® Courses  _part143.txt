tributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. Electrons are much smaller in mass than
protons, weighing only 9.11 × 10-28 grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an
element’s overall atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons
and calculate the atom’s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors
to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom’s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive
charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of
protons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with
no net charge.
Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom—greater than 99 percent—is, in
fact, empty space. With all
