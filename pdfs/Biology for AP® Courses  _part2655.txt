 these processes work,
we must first understand the energetics of water potential.
Water Potential
Plants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers. Using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential
energy, plants can move water to the top of a 116-meter-tall tree (Figure 23.31a). Plants can also use hydraulics to generate
enough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks (Figure 23.31b). Plants achieve this because of water potential.
Figure 23.31 With heights nearing 116 meters, (a) coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest trees in the
world. Plant roots can easily generate enough force to (b) buckle and break concrete sidewalks, much to the dismay of
homeowners and city maintenance departments. (credit a: modification of work by Bernt Rostad; credit b: modification
