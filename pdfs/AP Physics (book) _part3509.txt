-ray CT scans, whose images
reflect shape and structure—that is, the anatomy of the imaged region.
Figure 31–22 shows PET scans of the same person’s brain (a) when using a
cell phone near the ear and (b) with the cell phone off. The bright red spots in (a)
indicate a higher rate of glucose metabolism, suggesting excitability of brain
tissue (the glucose was tagged with a radioactive tracer). Emfs from the cell
phone antenna thus seem to affect metabolism and may be harmful to us!
The colors shown here are faked (only visible light has colors). The original
images are various shades of gray, representing intensity (or counts).
