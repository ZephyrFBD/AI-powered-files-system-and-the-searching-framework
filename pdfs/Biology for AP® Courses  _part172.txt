pulse conduction, muscle contractions and water balance. Many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide
these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise.
Covalent Bonds and Other Bonds and Interactions
Another way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds. These
bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are
commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds are also found in
inorganic molecules like H2O, CO2, and O2. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and
triple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds
are the strongest.
The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in
acquiring nitrogen for use in constr
