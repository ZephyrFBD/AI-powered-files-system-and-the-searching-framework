gs (Fig. 24â€“31) closer
together as you look farther from the center?
10. Some coated lenses appear greenish yellow when seen by
reflected light. What reflected wavelengths do you suppose
the coating is designed to eliminate completely?
11. A drop of oil on a pond appears bright at its edges, where
its thickness is much less than the wavelengths of visible
light. What can you say about the index of refraction of the
oil compared to that of water?
12. Radio waves and visible light are both electromagnetic
waves. Why can a radio receive a signal behind a hill when
we cannot see the transmitting antenna?
13. Hold one hand close to your eye and focus on a distant
light source through a narrow slit between two fingers.
(Adjust your fingers to obtain the best pattern.) Describe
the pattern that you see.
14. For diffraction by a single slit, what is the effect of increasing
(a) the slit width, (b) the wavelength?
15. Describe the single-slit diffraction pattern produced when
white light falls
