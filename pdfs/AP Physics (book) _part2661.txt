e there is the strongest maximum. Between the minima,
smaller intensity maxima occur at approximately (not exactly)
Note that the minima for a diffraction pattern, Eq. 24–3b, satisfy a criterion
that looks very similar to that for the maxima (bright spots or fringes) for double-
slit interference, Eq. 24–2a. Also note that D is a single slit width, whereas d in
Eqs. 24–2 is the distance between two slits.
Single-slit diffraction maximum. Light of wavelength
750 nm passes through a slit 
wide. How wide is the central max-
imum (a) in degrees, and (b) in centimeters, on a screen 20 cm away?
APPROACH The width of the central maximum goes from the first minimum
on one side to the first minimum on the other side. We use Eq. 24–3a to find the
angular position of the first single-slit diffraction minimum.
SOLUTION (a) The first minimum occurs at
So 
This is the angle between the center and the first minimum,
Fig. 24–22. The angle subtended by the whole central maximum, between the
minima abov
