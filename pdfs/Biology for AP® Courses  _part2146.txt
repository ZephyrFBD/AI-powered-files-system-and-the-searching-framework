two alleles B and b occur with equal frequency, so p = q = 0.5. If only half the
individuals reproduce, and by chance most of the reproducing alleles of are of B, then the second generation
results in p = 0.7 and q = 0.3. In the second generation, only two individuals, both of whom are homozygote in B,
reproduce. This leads to a loss of b from the third generation.
As seen from the table, the frequency of the b allele is reduced as a percentage of the population due to
genetic drift.

Table 19.1 Genotypic frequencies of rabbit populations undergoing genetic drift
Explain why small populations are more vulnerable to the forces of genetic drift than large populations.

The fewer individuals in a population, the more room there is for
