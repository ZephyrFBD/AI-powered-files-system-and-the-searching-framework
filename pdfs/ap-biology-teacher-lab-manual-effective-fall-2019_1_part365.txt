onsortium has a Java-based Web activity 
that will review the properties of light and the ways in which visible light interacts with 
matter in the process of photosynthesis. This multistep activity uses visualizations, 
animations, and a molecular modeling engine that does an excellent job of making 
abstract concepts understandable. To explore this activity, enter these terms in your 
search engine: “concord consortium molecular workbench photosynthesis.” 
While going through this activity, record any questions in your laboratory notebook. 
These questions and others that occur to you while working through the steps in 
Procedure can serve as a basis for your own investigation in Designing and Conducting 
Your Investigation. 
■ Procedure 
In this part of the lab, you will learn how the floating leaf disk technique can measure 
the rate of photosynthesis by testing a variable that you know affects photosynthesis. 
Later, you will apply this technique (or computer-based probes) to test
