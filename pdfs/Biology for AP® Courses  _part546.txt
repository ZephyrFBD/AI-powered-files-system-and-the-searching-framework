y fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without
causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal when the needle is extracted.
The mosaic characteristics of the membrane explain some but not all of its fluidity. There are two other factors that help
maintain this fluid characteristic. One factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves. In their saturated form, the fatty
acids in phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. There are no double bonds between adjacent carbon
atoms. This results in tails that are relatively straight. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number
of hydrogen atoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms; a double bond results in a bend
in the string of carbons of approximately 30 degrees (Figure 5.3).
Thus, if saturated fatty acids, with their straight tails, are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each
other, making a dense and fairly rigi
