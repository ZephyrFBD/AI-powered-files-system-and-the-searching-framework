ids contain phosphorus but not sulfur. So if phosphorus entered the cell but sulfur did not, a
nucleic acid was most likely injected. Choice (A) is incorrect because carbohydrates typically do not contain
phosphorus. Proteins typically contain sulfur but not phosphorus, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is
incorrect because steroids are a type of lipid that do not contain phosphorus.
3. (B) The primary structure of a protein is formed by linking amino acids, and dehydration reactions link amino
acids in covalent bonds between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino
acid. Choice (A) is incorrect because dehydration reactions do not form ionic bonds. Choices (C) and (D) are
incorrect because hydrolysis reactions break, not form, bonds between monomers.
4. (C) Saturated lipids have carbon atoms linked through single bonds and form straight chains; this makes
saturated lipids easier to pack tightly and more likely to be solid at room temperature. Choi
