who are orchestrating breeding to create traits that we desire. This makes these traits selected for even if they are not
increasing the reproductive fitness of a species.
Another type of selection to be aware of is artificial selection. This is a type of selection where humans directly
affect variation in other species. For example, colors of plants and sizes of dogs are greatly influenced by humans
who are orchestrating breeding to create traits that we desire. This makes these traits selected for even if they are not

A dog and a bumblebee obviously cannot produce offspring. Therefore, they are different species. However, a
