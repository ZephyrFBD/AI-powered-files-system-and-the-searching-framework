ngular magnification.
27. (II) A 3.80-mm-wide bolt is viewed with a 9.60-cm-focal-
length lens. A normal eye views the image at its near point.
Calculate (a) the angular magnification, (b) the width of
the image, and (c) the object distance from the lens.
28. (II) A magnifying glass with a focal length of 9.2 cm is used
to read print placed at a distance of 8.0 cm. Calculate (a) the
position of the image; (b) the angular magnification.
29. (III) A writer uses a converging lens of focal length
as a magnifying glass to read fine print on his book contract.
Initially, the writer holds the lens above the fine print so that
its image is at infinity. To get a better look, he then moves
the lens so that the image is at his 25-cm near point. How
far, and in what direction (toward or away from the fine
print) did the writer move the lens? Assume his eye is
adjusted to remain always very near the magnifying glass.
30. (III) A magnifying glass is rated at 
for a normal eye
that is relaxed. What w
