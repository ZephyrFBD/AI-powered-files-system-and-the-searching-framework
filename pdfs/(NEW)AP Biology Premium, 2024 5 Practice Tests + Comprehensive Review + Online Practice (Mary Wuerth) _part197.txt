scribes a relationship between the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin
cycle?
(A) The light-dependent reactions supply the Calvin cycle with oxygen, and the Calvin cycle returns carbon
dioxide to the light-dependent reactions.
(B) The light-dependent reactions supply the Calvin cycle with ATP, and the Calvin cycle returns ADP to the
light-dependent reactions.
(C) The light-dependent reactions supply the Calvin cycle with carbon dioxide, and the Calvin cycle returns
oxygen to the light-dependent reactions.
(D) The light-dependent reactions supply the Calvin cycle with NADP+, and the Calvin cycle returns NADPH
to the light-dependent reactions.
10. In the light-dependent reactions, the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain is
(A) oxygen.
(B) water.
(C) NAD+.
(D) NADP+.
