ration, a process in which energy (in the form of ATP) is obtained from
carbohydrates, fats, and occasionally proteins. Mitochondria have two bilayer membranes, allowing the separation
of metabolic processes that occur inside the inner membrane from those occurring in the intermembrane space.
8. Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis, the plant process of incorporating energy from sunlight into
carbohydrates. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, also have two membranes.
9. Microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments are three protein fibers of decreasing diameter,
respectively. All are involved in establishing the shape of or in coordinating movements of the cytoskeleton, the
internal structure of the cytoplasm.
Microtubules are made of the protein tubulin and provide support and motility for cellular activities. They are
found in the spindle apparatus, which guides the movement of chromosomes during cell division, and in flagella
and cilia (described in item 10), structures th
