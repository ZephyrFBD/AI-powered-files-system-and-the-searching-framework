conomically practical.
8. Reduction of Derivatives Unnecessary derivatization (intermediate compound 
formation, temporary modification of physical/chemical processes) should be min-
imized or avoided if possible because such steps require additional reagents and can 
generate waste.
9. Catalysis Catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) improve product yields within 
a given time and with a lower energy cost compared to noncatalytic processes and 
are, therefore, preferred to noncatalytic alternatives.
10. Design for Degradation The end products of chemical processing should break 
down at the end of their useful lives into innocuous degradation products that do 
not persist in the environment.
11. Real-Time Analysis for Pollution Prevention Analytical methods need to be 
developed that allow for real-time, in-process monitoring and control prior to the 
formation of hazardous substances.
12. Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident Prevention Reagents and solvents 
used in a chemi
