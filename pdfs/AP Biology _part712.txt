photoexcited rhodopsin activates several hundred enzyme molecules, each
of which activates several hundred molecules of cGMP, a ubiquitous
second messenger, closing hundreds of Na+ channels, and causing an
impulse to be sent to the optic nerve. From the optic nerve, impulses travel
to the cortex of the brain where the messages are interpreted and seeing
actually occurs.
STUDY TIP
Here’s another example of a signal transduction pathway.
COLOR VISION AND YOU
Mammals have poorer color vision than other vertebrates. This may result
from our long evolutionary history of nocturnal living in which we have
lost much of the color vision found in other vertebrates.
In humans, another opsin molecule has evolved by means of gene
duplication. The gene for it is located on the X chromosome and has
generally enhanced our color vision. However, in abo
