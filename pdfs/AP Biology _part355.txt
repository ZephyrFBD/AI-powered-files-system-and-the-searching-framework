TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
Restriction Enzymes
Restriction enzymes were discovered in the late 1960s and are a basic
biotechnology tool. They are extracted from bacteria, which use them to
fend off attacks by invading bacteriophages. Restriction enzymes cut DNA
at specific recognition sequences or sites, such as GAATTC. Often these
cuts are staggered, leaving single-stranded sticky ends to form a
temporary union with other sticky ends. The fragments that result from the
cuts made by restriction enzymes are called restriction fragments.

Be able to explain how heritable information can be manipulated using technologies.
Scientists have now isolated hundreds of different restriction enzymes.
They are named for the bacteria in which they were found. Common
examples are EcoRI (which was discovered in E. coli), BamHI, and
HINDIII. Restriction enzymes have many uses, including gene cloning.
