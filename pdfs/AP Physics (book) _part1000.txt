ive bricks must
extend no more than (starting at the top) 
and 
of their length beyond the one below (Fig. 9–75a). (b) Is 
the top brick completely beyond the base? (c) Determine a
general formula for the maximum total distance spanned by
n bricks if they are to remain stable. (d) A builder wants to
construct a corbeled arch (Fig. 9–75b) based on the princi-
ple of stability discussed in (a) and (c) above. What minimum
number of bricks, each 0.30 m long and uniform, is needed
if the arch is to span 1.0 m?
