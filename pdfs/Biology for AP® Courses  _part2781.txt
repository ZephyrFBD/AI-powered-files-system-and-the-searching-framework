104. After branches of woody saplings were trimmed, half
of the cuts were covered with a sealant and the other half
were left untouched. The plants with sealed cuts fared
much better after several weeks. What is the likely reason?
a.
The sealant stopped evaporation.
b.
The plants with sealed cuts grew new branches.
c.
The plants with unsealed cuts were infected by
pathogens that entered through the cuts.
d.
The plants with unsealed cuts lost
photosynthates through bleeding of sap.

Jasmonate is produced in plants as a response to injury.
Researchers compared the response to infection of mutant
plants that were unable to produce jasmonate (Ja-) with the
response of normal plants (Ja+) from the same species.
Leaves were inoculated with spores from pathogenic
molds. The size of the wounds was examined 48 hours
after application. The plants were also infected with moths
and the weight of th
