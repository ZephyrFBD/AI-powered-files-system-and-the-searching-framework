Then after a time it will have traveled along the x axis a distance

(iii)
(iv)
From Eq. (iv),
and we substitute this into Eq. (iii) and find
We cancel out the on each side
and solve for to find
We have found that is, in fact, the value for we used in Chapter 26, Eq. 26–2.
Now that we have found 
we need only find the relation between and 
To do so, we combine 
with 
We solve for , doing some algebra, and fi
