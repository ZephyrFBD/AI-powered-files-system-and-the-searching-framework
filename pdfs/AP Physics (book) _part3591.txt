he energy released,
, is the change in mass
Next we apply conservation of momentum: the initial particle 
is at rest, so the 
and p have opposite momentum but are equal in magnitude:
We square
this equation,
which becomes, using Eq. 26–9 (
),
Solving for 
We substitute Eq. 26–6a,
for both the 
and the p:
Next (after cancelling as shown) we substitute
After cancelling as shown, we solve for 
which gives
Then 
32–5 Neutrinos
We first met neutrinos with regard to 
decay in Section 30–5. The study of
neutrinos is a “hot” subject today. Experiments are being carried out in deep
underground laboratories, sometimes in deep mine shafts. The thick layer of
earth above is meant to filter out all other “background” particles, leaving mainly
the very weakly interacting neutrinos to arrive at the detectors.
Some very important results have come to the fore in recent years. First there
was the solar neutrino problem. The energy output of the Sun is believed to be
due to the nuclear fusion reactions
