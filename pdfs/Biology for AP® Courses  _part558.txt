ma membranes are amphiphilic: They have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps
the movement of some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble material with a
low molecular weight can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fat-soluble
vitamins A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble
drugs and hormones also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the bodyâ€™s tissues and organs. Similarly,
molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and so pass through membranes by simple diffusion.
Polar substances present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a
cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. Additionally, while small ions could easily
slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charg
