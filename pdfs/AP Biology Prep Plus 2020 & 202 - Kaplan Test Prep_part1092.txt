20. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is secreted by myocytes in the heart’s
atria in response to stretching of the atrial walls, which is caused by
increased blood volume. The primary function of ANP is to increase
excretion of sodium and water, but it also reduces hormone secretion in
the adrenal gland and has been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy in
heart failure.
Which of the following statements concerning ANP’s actions in the body is
most likely to be true?
ANP acts in an endocrine manner to increase glomerular filtration
rate and glomerular permeability in the kidney.
(A)
ANP acts in a paracrine manner to reduce aldosterone secretion by
the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex.
(B)
ANP acts in an exocrine manner to inhibit norepinephrine-mediated
calcium influx in cardiac myocytes.
(C)
ANP acts in an autocrine manner to relax the vascular smooth
myocytes in arterioles and venules.
