ent, then:  
P(A and B) = P(A) ¥  P(B) 
Hardy-Weinberg Equations 
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 
p = frequency of the dominant allele 
in a population 
p + q = 1 
q = frequency of the recessive allele 
in a population 
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set 
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set 
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points 
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum) 
-4-
pH = – log10 [H+] 
T2 = higher temperature 
T1 = lower temperature 
k2 = reaction rate at T2 
k1 = reaction rate at T1 
Q10 = the factor by which the 
reaction rate increases when 
the temperature is raised by 
ten degrees 
Dilution (used to create a dilute solution from a 
concentrated stock solution) 
CiVi = CfVf
i = initial (starting) 
C = concentration of solute 
f = final   (desired) 
V = volume of solution
