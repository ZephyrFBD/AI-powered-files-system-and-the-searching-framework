t L has the same slope as C at the 2-hour 
point. Then we can see that L rises about 5 units between 1 and 2 hours, just twice the 
average slope for the first 2 hours. 
We have seen that a perfectly flat curve, like that for Process I or II, means that the 
corresponding progress curve is a perfectly straight line having the same slope at all 
points. Conversely, a progress curve that changes in slope, like that of Process III, will 
give a rate curve that looks like steps. You should be able to figure out that the “steps” 
on the rate curve will be sharp and square if the progress curve has an abrupt change in 
slope, and more rounded off if the progress curve changes slope gradually. In any case, in 
regions where the rate curve is perfectly flat it is clear that the progress curve must have 
constant steepness, or slope. However, if the progress curve itself gets perfectly flat, then 
that portion of the progress curve has 0 slope; in other words, the reaction has stopped.
