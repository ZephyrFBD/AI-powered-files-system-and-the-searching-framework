FIGURE 2;25 Example 2–16.
(a) A person stands on the edge 
of a cliff. A ball is thrown upward,
then falls back down past the
thrower to the base of the cliff,
50.0 m below. (b) The y vs.
graph.

Additional Example—Using the Quadratic Formula
EXERCISE F Two balls are thrown from a cliff. One is thrown directly up, the other
directly down. Both balls have the same initial speed, and both hit the ground below the
cliff but at different times. Which ball hits the ground at the greater speed: (a) the ball
thrown upward, (b) the ball thrown downward, or (c) both the same? Ignore air resistance.
