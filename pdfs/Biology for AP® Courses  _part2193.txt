ing evolution. You suspect there is
selection pressure on the color of the flower: bees seem to
cluster around the red flowers more often than the blue
flowers. In a separate experiment, you discover that blue
flower color is dominant to red flower color. In a field, you
count 600 blue flowers and 200 red flowers. What would
you expect the genetic structure of the flowers to be?
a.
You would expect 300 homozygous dominant
blue flowers, 300 heterozygous blue flowers,
and 200 homozygous recessive red flowers.
b.
You would expect 200 homozygous dominant
blue flowers, 400 heterozygous blue flowers,
and 200 homozygous recessive red flowers.
c.
You would expect 100 homozygous dominant
red flowers, 100 heterozygous red flowers, and
600 homozygous recessive blue flowers.
d.
You would expect 14 homozygous dominant red
flowers, 186 heterozygous blue flowers, and 600
homozygous recessive blue flowers.
