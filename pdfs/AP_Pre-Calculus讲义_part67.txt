l conditions a certain bacteria population doubles every three hours. Initially 
there are 1000 bacteria in a colony. 
(a) Find a model for the bacteria population after t hours. 
(b) How many bacteria are in the colony after 15 hours? 
(c) After how many hours will the bacteria count reach 100,000?

2.10.3 Exponential Growth (Relative Growth Rate)  
We have used an exponential function with base 2 to model population growth (in terms of 
the doubling time). 
In fact, we can find an exponential model with any base. If we use the base e, we get a 
population model in terms of the relative growth rate r: the rate of population growth 
expressed as a proportion of the population at any time. 
A population that experiences exponential growth increases according to the model
