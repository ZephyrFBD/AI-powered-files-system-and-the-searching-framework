se enough.
Any reference frame that moves with constant velocity (say, a car or an air-
plane) relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial reference frame. Reference
frames where the law of inertia does not hold, such as the accelerating reference
frames discussed above, are called noninertial reference frames. How can we be
sure a reference frame is inertial or not? By checking to see if Newton’s first law
holds. Thus Newton’s first law serves as the definition of inertial reference frames.
4–3 Mass
Newton’s second law, which we come to in the next Section, makes use of the
concept of mass. Newton used the term mass as a synonym for “quantity of matter.”
This intuitive notion of the mass of an object is not very precise because the
concept “quantity of matter” is not very well defined. More precisely, we can say
that mass is a measure of the inertia of an object. The more mass an object has,
the greater the force needed to give it a particular acceleration. It is harder to start
