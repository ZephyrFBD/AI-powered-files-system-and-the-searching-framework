ted and the alternative hypothesis is accepted; the population is not in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If the deviation is not significant, the null
hypothesis is not rejected and the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
(c) For several years, the 25-mile radius area experienced severe drought.
Predict the eﬀect the drought will have on the frequencies of green and
brown beetles. (1 point)

The null hypothesis is that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; the alternative
hypothesis is that the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The change in the environment most likely will cause a change in the frequencies
of brown and green beetles. The drought will probably cause an increase in the
number of brown beetles and a decrease in the number of green beetles.
(d) Justify your prediction. (1 point)
