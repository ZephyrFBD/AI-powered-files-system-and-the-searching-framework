sically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments
can only “see” (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment
molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants
as photosynthetically active radiation.
The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or
a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum shows the rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy. At the
other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy (Figure 8.12).
