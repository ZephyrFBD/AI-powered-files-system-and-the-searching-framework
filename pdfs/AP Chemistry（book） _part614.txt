[4.33]
Although we derived Equation 4.33 in terms of liters, any volume unit can be used as 
long as it is used on both sides of the equation. For example, in the calculation we did for 
the CuSO4 solution, we have
11.00 M)1Vconc2 = 10.100 M)1250.0 mL2
Solving for Vconc gives Vconc = 25.0 mL as before.

Chemical Analysis
In Chapter 3 we learned that given the chemical equation for a reaction and the amount of 
one reactant consumed in the reaction, you can calculate the quantities of other reactants 
and products. In this section we extend this concept to reactions involving solutions.
Recall that the coefficients in a balanced equation give the relative number of moles 
of reactants and products. 
(Section 3.6) To use this information, we must convert the
