sing your 
results from (a) and (b), calculate the percentage of Pt at-
oms that are on the surface of a 2.0-nm nanoparticle. (d) 
Repeat these calculations for a 5.0-nm platinum nanopar-
ticle. (e) Which size of nanoparticle would you expect to 
be more catalytically active and why?
 14.114 One of the many remarkable enzymes in the human body 
is carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the interconver-
sion of carbon dioxide and water with bicarbonate ion 
and protons. If it were not for this enzyme, the body could 
not rid itself rapidly enough of the CO2 accumulated by 
cell metabolism. The enzyme catalyzes the dehydration 
(release to air) of up to 107 CO2 molecules per second. 
Which components of this description correspond to the 
terms enzyme, substrate, and turnover number?
 14.115  Suppose that, in the absence of a catalyst, a certain bio-
chemical reaction occurs x times per second at normal body 
temperature 137 Â°C2. In order to be physiologically useful, 
the reaction needs to
