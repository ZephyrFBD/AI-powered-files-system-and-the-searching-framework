Learning Objective 
1.13: The student is able to construct and/or justify 
mathematical models, diagrams, or simulations that 
represent processes of biological evolution.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The population of beetles after pollution would not have 
shifted to a more light-colored beetle as indicated in diagram I because the tree 
trunks would have been darker, and the lighter colored beetles would have been 
eaten by predators more easily since they were light and the trees were dark.  
The suggestion that the predators would find the darker tree trunks more easily  
is irrelevant.
(B)
This option is incorrect. After the pollution the coloration could not have split 
into two groups because the lighter colored beetles would not have been able to 
hide on the darker tree trunks and thus would have been preyed upon.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The coloration range after pollution would not have 
become narrower,
