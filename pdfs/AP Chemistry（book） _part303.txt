Sample Exercise 2.5
Using the Periodic Table
Which two of these elements would you expect to show the  
greatest similarity in chemical and physical properties:  
B, Ca, F, He, Mg, P?
trace amounts of another nonmetallic element might have 
similar behavior. To which element should she turn her  
attention? (a) F (b) As (c) Se (d) Cr (e) P
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Locate Na (sodium) and Br (bromine) in the periodic table. 
Give the atomic number of each and classify each as metal, 
metalloid, or nonmetal.
SOLUTION
Elements in the same group of the periodic table are most likely to ex-
hibit similar properties. We therefore expect Ca and Mg to be most alike 
because they are in the same group (2A, the alkaline earth metals).
