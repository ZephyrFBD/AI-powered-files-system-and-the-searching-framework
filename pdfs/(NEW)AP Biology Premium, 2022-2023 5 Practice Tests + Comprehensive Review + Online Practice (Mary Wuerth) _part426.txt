ize, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C)
is incorrect because PCR amplifies the number of copies of a specific DNA sequence. Restriction enzymes cut
DNA at specific sequences, so choice (D) is incorrect.
9. (D) The phosphates in the backbone of the DNA double helix have a slight negative charge and are attracted to
the positive electrode. The nitrogen atoms in the nitrogenous bases are not charged, so choice (A) is incorrect.
Hydrogen bonds between the base pairs do not result in a net negative charge, so choice (B) is incorrect. The
oxygen atoms in the deoxyribose sugars are not charged, and thus choice (C) is incorrect.
10. (B) The denaturation stage that occurs during each cycle of PCR requires high temperatures that would
denature most enzymes, so a heat-stable DNA polymerase is required for PCR. Heat-stable DNA polymerases
do not add DNA nucleotides at a faster rate than other DNA polymerases, so choice (A) is incorrect. PCR
primers anneal to the target DNA sequence, not to the
