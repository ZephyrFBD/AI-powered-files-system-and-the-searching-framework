) and (C) are incorrect.
Glucose is the preferred food source for bacteria, so if high levels of glucose were present, the bacteria would
not express the lac operon at a high level until all of the glucose was metabolized. Therefore, choice (D) is
incorrect.
6. (B) Methylating nucleotides is a type of epigenetic change to DNA. Choice (A) is incorrect because mutations
change the DNA sequences and do not involve methylation. An aneuploidy is an incorrect number of
chromosomes, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because transposition involves the movement
or rearrangement of pieces of DNA and does not involve methylation.
7. (A) Activators are proteins in eukaryotes that bind to regulatory switches and upregulate gene expression.
Choice (B) is incorrect because repressors downregulate gene expression. Transcription factors help RNA
polymerase bind to the promoter and do not bind to regulatory switches, so choice (C) is incorrect. Mediators
are proteins that allow communi
