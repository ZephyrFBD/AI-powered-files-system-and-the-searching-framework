with calcium oxide to form solid calcium 
 
sulfite. (a) Write the balanced chemical equation for the 
reaction. (b) If the coal is burned in a power plant that uses 
2000.0 tons of coal per day, what mass of calcium oxide is re-
quired daily to eliminate the sulfur dioxide? (c) How many 
grams of calcium sulfite does this power plant produce daily?
 3.113  Hydrogen cyanide, HCN, is a poisonous gas. The lethal dose 
is approximately 300 mg HCN per kilogram of air when in-
haled. (a) Calculate the amount of HCN that gives the lethal 
dose in a small laboratory room measuring 12 * 15 * 8.0 ft. 
The density of air at 26 °C is 0.00118 g>cm3. (b) If the HCN 
is formed by reaction of NaCN with an acid such as H2SO4, 
what mass of NaCN gives the lethal dose in the room?
