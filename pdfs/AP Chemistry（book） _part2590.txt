Calculate (a) Kb for the fluoride ion, (b) Ka for the ammonium ion.
Solve
(a) For the weak acid HF
, Table 16.2 and Appendix D give 
Ka = 6.8 * 10-4. We can use Equation 16.40 to calculate Kb 
for the conjugate base, F -:
(b) For NH3, Table 16.4 and Appendix D give Kb = 1.8 * 10-5, 
and this value in Equation 16.40 gives us Ka for the conjugate 
acid, NH4
+:
Analyze We are asked to determine dissociation constants for F -, 
the conjugate base of HF
, and NH4
+, the conjugate acid of NH3.
Check The respective K values for F - and NH4
+ are listed in  
Table 16.5, where we see that the values calculated here agree with 
those in Table 16.5.
