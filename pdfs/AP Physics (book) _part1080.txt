inside the house.
Hence, air and smoke are pushed up the chimney by the higher indoor pressure.
Even on an apparently still night there is usually enough ambient air flow at the
top of a chimney to assist upward flow of smoke.
If gophers, prairie dogs, rabbits, and other animals that live underground are
to avoid suffocation, the air must circulate in their burrows. The burrows always
have at least two entrances (Fig. 10–30). The speed of air flow across different
holes will usually be slightly different. This results in a slight pressure difference,
which forces a flow of air through the burrow via Bernoulli’s principle. The flow
of air is enhanced if one hole is higher than the other (animals often build mounds)
since wind speed tends to increase with height.

Bernoulli’s equation ignores the effects of friction (viscosity) and the com-
pressibility of the fluid. The energy that is transformed to internal (or potenti
