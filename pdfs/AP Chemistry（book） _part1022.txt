) If molybdenum is irradiated with light of wavelength of 
120 nm, what is the maximum possible kinetic energy of the 
emitted electrons?
 6.34  Titanium metal requires a photon with a minimum energy of 
6.94 * 10 - 19 J to emit electrons. (a) What is the minimum 
frequency of light necessary to emit electrons from titanium 
via the photoelectric effect? (b) What is the wavelength of 
this light? (c) Is it possible to eject electrons from titanium 
metal using visible light? (d) If titanium is irradiated with 
light of wavelength 233 nm, what is the maximum possible 
kinetic energy of the emitted electrons?
