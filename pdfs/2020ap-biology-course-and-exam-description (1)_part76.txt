ifferences related to their 
function—
a.	Both DNA and RNA have three 
components—sugar, a phosphate group, 
and a nitrogenous base—that form 
nucleotide units that are connected by 
covalent bonds to form a linear molecule 
with 5’ and 3’ ends, with the nitrogenous 
bases perpendicular to the sugar-phosphate 
backbone.
b.	The basic structural differences between 
DNA and RNA include the following:
	 i.	DNA contains deoxyribose and RNA 
contains ribose.
 ii.	RNA contains uracil and DNA 
contains thymine.
iii.	DNA is usually double stranded; RNA is 
usually single stranded.
iv.	The two DNA strands in double-stranded 
DNA are antiparallel in directionality.
