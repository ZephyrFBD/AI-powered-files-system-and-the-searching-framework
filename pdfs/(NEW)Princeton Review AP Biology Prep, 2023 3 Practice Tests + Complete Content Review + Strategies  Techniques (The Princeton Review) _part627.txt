48. If a plant undergoing the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis began to release 18O2 instead of normal
oxygen, one could most reasonably conclude that the plant had been supplied with
(A) H2O containing radioactive oxygen

49. Yeast haploid cells secrete pheromones to other yeast to indicate they want to mate, and others respond by
growing toward these potential mates. The pheromones bind to a receptor, which eventually leads to increased
expression of transcription factors required for this
