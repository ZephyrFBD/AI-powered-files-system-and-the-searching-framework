is a proton-transfer reaction, and the position of the 
equilibrium will favor the proton going to the stronger of two 
bases. The two bases in the equation are CO3
2 -, the base in the 
forward reaction, and SO4
2 -, the conjugate base of HSO4
-. We can 
find the relative positions of these two bases in Figure 16.4 to de-
termine which is the stronger base.
Solve The CO3
2 -  ion appears lower in the right-hand column in 
Figure 16.4 and is therefore a stronger base than SO4
2 -. Therefore, 
CO3
2- will get the proton preferentially to become HCO3
-, while 
SO4
2 -  will remain mostly unprotonated. The resulting equilib-
rium lies to the right, favoring products (that is, Kc 7 1):
HSO4
-1aq2 + CO3
2-1aq2 âˆ† SO4
2-1aq2 + HCO3
-
  1aq2 Kc 7 1
Comment Of the two acids HSO4
-  and HCO3
-, the stronger one 
1HSO4
-2 gives up a proton more readily, and the weaker one 
1HCO3
-2 tends to retain its proton. Thus, the equilibrium favors 
the direction in which the proton moves from the stronger
