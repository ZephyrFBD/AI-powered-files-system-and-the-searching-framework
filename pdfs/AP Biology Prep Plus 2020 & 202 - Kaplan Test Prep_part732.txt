ers,
which will be more susceptible to being blown down, while dense
foliage selects against any tree significantly shorter than the others,
which will be unable to get enough sunlight for photosynthesis.
Because average heights are favored, the distribution should form a
bell curve, as suggested in (A). (B) is incorrect because tall heights
make the trees susceptible to high winds that can uproot them. (C) is
incorrect because short heights make it harder for the trees to get
enough sunlight. (D) is incorrect because both tall and short trees have
disadvantages, meaning that average values are favored over the
extremes.

The results of the study show that eggs with greater contrast are far
more likely to be rejected than those with less contrast. This suggests
that there is coevolution between the parrotbill and cuckoo
populations, with a constant selective pressure for cuckoo eggs to
resemble parrotbill eggs. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
