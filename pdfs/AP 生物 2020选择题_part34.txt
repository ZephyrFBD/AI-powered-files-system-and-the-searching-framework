e table, which of the following best explains the effects of rotenone on cellular 
respiration? 
(A) Rotenone acts as an inhibitor of the enzymes in the Krebs cycle. 
(B) NADH, produced during glycolysis, is not able to enter the mitochondria because transport proteins are 
blocked from entering. 
(C) Treated cells are not able to break down NADH because certain enzymes of the electron transport chain 
are inhibited. 
(D) Rotenone acts as an allosteric inhibitor of glycolytic enzymes, thus inhibiting cellular respiration.

35. Which of the following best explains why 
triploid bananas do not produce seeds? 
(A) The cells of the banana plant are unable to 
replicate DNA, thus preventing cell 
division and limiting growth. 
(B) The banana plants lack enough genetic 
diversity to properly hybridize. 
(C) The production of gametes is disrupted 
because of unequal pairing of 
homologous chromosomes du
