114. Like the animal intestine, the organ system
principally responsible for nutrient and water uptake, the
plant root system, is home to a microbiome upon which
the host depends. One important role for the root
microbiome is innate immunity. Wheat take-all is a disease
caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis that
attacks plant roots and blocks root water channels. When a
major outbreak occurs in a wheat field, susceptibility
remains high in the following year. But after four to six
continued crops of wheat in the same field, susceptibility
to the disease declines. This resistance can be transferred
with the soil. Burning the soil surface or rotation with
another crop returns susceptibility to the next wheat crop.
