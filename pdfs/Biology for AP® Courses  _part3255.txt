Higher Processing
The myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities
of the visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form,
movement, depth, and differences in brightness. Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries
information on color and fine detail. Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information
crosses to the opposite side of the brain. This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek,
for “crossing”) found at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.
Once in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of
visual information to humans and other animals. One route takes the signals to the thala
