d of the process.
(C)
Photosynthesis is an exergonic process because algae expend
the energy from photosynthesis to perform cellular work.
(D)
3. Yeast cells obtain energy by metabolizing sugars produced by
other organisms. In an experiment, yeast cells are mixed with
barley seeds, which supply a source of starch for fermentation.
Fermentation is measured by estimating the production of CO2 in
a respirometer, a device that measures changes in gas volume.
Which of the following experimental conditions would most likely
yield the highest level of fermentation?
Mixing barley seeds and yeast in water
(A)
Scratching barley seeds to release starch before adding yeast
(B)
Presoaking barley seeds in water to activate enzymes that
break down starch
(C)
Germinating barley seeds until seedlings emerge before
mixing them with the yeast
(D)
4. The following diagram illustrates a classic experiment in
chemiosmosis in which isolated thylakoid membranes are
incubated in the dark at pH 4 and, a»áer equi
