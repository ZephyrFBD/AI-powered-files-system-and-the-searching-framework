Theoretically, Oblimersen should work in preventing cancer.

(C) Only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is
available to the next trophic level. The remainder is lost as heat,
waste products, and uneaten body parts.
(D) Protons flowing down a gradient through ATP synthase provide
energy to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. Energy from the exergonic
flow of electrons to oxygen provides the energy to pump protons
across the cristae membrane and form a gradient. Choice A is
incorrect because this flow of electrons is used to pump protons to
the outer mitochondrial compartment and create a proton gradient
from which A
