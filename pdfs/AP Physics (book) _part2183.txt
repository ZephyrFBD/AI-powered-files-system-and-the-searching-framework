olidified at various times in the past (age determined by radioactive
dating—see Section 30–11) suggests that Earth’s magnetic poles have not only moved significantly
over geologic time, but have also reversed direction 400 times over the last 330 million years.
Also note that a compass gives a false reading if you are standing on rock containing magnetized 
iron ore (as you move around, the compass needle is inconsistent).

FIGURE 20–6 Using a map and compass in the 
wilderness. First you align the compass case so the 
needle points away from true north (N) exactly 
the number of degrees of declination stated 
on the map (for this topographic map, it is 17° as
shown just to the left of the compass). Then align
the map with true north, as shown, not with the
compass needle. [This is an old map (1953) of a
part of Californi
