CHAPTER 13
†The relative masses of different atoms came from analysis of chemical reactions, and the law of definite
proportions. It states that when two or more elements combine to form a compound, they always do
so in the same proportions by mass. For example, table salt is always formed from 23 parts sodium and
35 parts chlorine; and water from one part hydrogen and eight parts oxygen. A continuous theory of
matter could not account for the law of definite proportions but atomic theory does: the proportions
of each element that form a compound correspond to the relative masses of the combining atoms. One
atom of sodium (Na) combines with one atom of chlorine (Cl) to form one molecule of salt (NaCl),
and one atom of sodium has a mass 23 35 times as large as one of chlorine. Hydrogen, the lightest
atom, was arbitrarily assigned the relative mass of 1. On this scale, carbon was about 12, oxyg
