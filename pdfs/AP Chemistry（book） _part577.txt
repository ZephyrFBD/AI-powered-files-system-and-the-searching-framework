  
solution containing Mg2+1aq2 and Cl-1aq2 ions.
 
To balance this equation, we must provide two molecules of 
CH3COOH to furnish the two CH3COO- ions and to supply the 
two H+ ions needed to combine with the two OH- ions of the 
base. The balanced molecular equation is: 
(b)  
To write the complete ionic equation, we identify the strong 
electrolytes and break them into ions. In this case Ba1OH22 and 
Ba1CH3COO22 are both water-soluble ionic compounds and 
hence strong electrolytes. Thus, the complete ionic equation is: 
Check We can determine whether the molecular equation is bal-
anced by counting the number of atoms of each kind on both 
sides of the arrow (10 H, 6 O, 4 C, and 1 Ba on each side). However, 
it is often easier to check equations by counting groups: There are 
2 CH3COO groups, as well as 1 Ba, and 4 additional H atoms and 
2 additional O atoms on each side of the equation. The net ionic 
equation checks out because the numbers of each kind of element 
and the net cha
