ted at 2.0 W and 3.0 V is operated by
a 9.0-V battery. To light the bulb at its
rated voltage and power, a resistor R is
connected in series as shown
in Fig. 19–85. What value

89. A 12.0-V battery, two resistors, and two capacitors are
connected as shown in Fig. 19–87. After the circuit has
been connected for a long time, what is the charge on each
capacitor?
91. How much energy must a 24-V battery expend to charge
a
and a 
capacitor fully when they are
placed (a) in parallel, (b) in series? (c) How much charge
flowed from the battery in each case?
92. Two capacitors,
and 
are con-
nected in parallel to a 24-V source as shown in Fig. 19–89a.
After they are charged they are disconnected from the
source and from each other, and then reconnected directly
to each other with
plates of opposite sign
connected 
together
(see Fig. 19–89b). Find
