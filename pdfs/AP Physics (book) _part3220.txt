ng between atoms to form molecules, and how it explains
molecular behavior. We then examine how atoms and molecules form solids, with
emphasis on metals as well as on semiconductors and their use in electronics.
Covalent Bonds
To understand how covalent bonds are formed, we take the simplest case, the
bond that holds two hydrogen atoms together to form the hydrogen molecule,
The mechanism is basically the same for other covalent bonds. As two H atoms
approach each other, the electron clouds begin to overlap, and the electrons from
each atom can “orbit” both nuclei. (This is sometimes called sharing electrons.)
If both electrons are in the ground state 
of their respective atoms, there
are two possibilities: their spins can be parallel (both up or both down), in which
case the total spin is
or their spins can be opposite (
for one, and
for the other), so that the total spin 
We shall 
now see that a bond is formed only for the 
state, when the spins are 
opposite.
First we consider the
