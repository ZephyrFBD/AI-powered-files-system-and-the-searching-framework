 magnitudes of the
friction force 
and the normal force 
as an equation by inserting a constant of
proportionality,
[kinetic friction]
This relation is not a fundamental law; it is an experimental relation between
the magnitude of the friction force 
which acts parallel to the two surfaces, and
the magnitude of the normal force 
which acts perpendicular to the surfaces.
It is not a vector equation since the two forces have different directions, perpendicular
to one another. The term 
is called the coefficient of kinetic friction, and its value
depends on the nature of the two surfaces. Measured values for a variety of sur-
faces are given in Table 4â€“2. These are only approximate, however, since 
depends
on whether the surfaces are wet or dry, on how much they have been sanded or
rubbed, if any burrs remain, and other such factors. But 
(which has no units) is
roughly independent of the sliding speed, as well as the area in contact.
