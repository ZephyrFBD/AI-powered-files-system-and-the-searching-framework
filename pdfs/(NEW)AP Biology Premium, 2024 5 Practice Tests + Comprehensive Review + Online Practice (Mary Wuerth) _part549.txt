K-Selected vs. r-Selected Populations
As discussed in Chapter 22, energy availability affects the reproductive strategies of populations. Populations that
live in more stable environments and have more energy available tend to have K-selected reproductive strategies. K-
selected populations possess relatively stable population sizes at or near the carrying capacity of their environment.
K-selected populations usually reproduce more than once per lifetime, with few offspring per reproductive cycle. K-
selected populations invest greater levels of parental care in their offspring, resulting in higher survival rates in their
offspring. K-selected populations experience logistic growth and are sensitive to density-dependent factors. Most
mammal and bird species are K-selected populations.
Populations that live in unstable environments and have less energy available have r-selected reproductive
strategies. These popu
