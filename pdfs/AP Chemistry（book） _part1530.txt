to molecules going from their ground 
state to their first excited state. (a) Write out the molecular 
orbital valence electron configurations for the ground state 
and first excited state for N2. (b) Is N2 paramagnetic or di-
amagnetic in its first excited state? (c) The electronic ab-
sorption spectrum of the N2 molecule has the lowest energy 
peak at 170 nm. To what orbital transition does this corre-
spond? (d) Calculate the energy of the HOMO-LUMO tran-
sition in part (a) in terms of kJ/mol. (e) Is the N ¬ N bond in 
the first excited state stronger or weaker compared to that in 
the ground state?

One of the molecular orbitals of the H2
- ion is sketched 
below:
 
 
 
 
(a) Is the molecular orbital a s or p MO? Is it bonding or 
antibonding? (b) In H2
-, how many electrons occupy the 
MO shown above? (c) What is the bond order in the H2
- 
ion? (d) Compared to the H ¬H bond in H2, the H ¬ H 
bond in H2
- is expected to be which of the following: 
 
(i) Shorter and stronge
