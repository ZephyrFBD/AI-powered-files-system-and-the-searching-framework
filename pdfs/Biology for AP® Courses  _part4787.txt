Activity
Importing of Exotic Species. Introducing a non-native species into an established community can have a
number of possible effects. Using your local environment for inspiration, predict some of these effects.
What factors should be considered before the importation of non-native or invasive species? Design a
campaign that highlights the dangers of importing a specific nonâ€“native or invasive species into your local
environment.
