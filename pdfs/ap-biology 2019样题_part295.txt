6.C: Provide reasoning 
to justify a claim by 
connecting evidence to 
biological theories.
Explain how the data relate 
to a biological theory.
Explain how reasoning

They 
should then explain—using 
biological concepts and 
data—the conclusions 
from the peppered moth 
experiment and the 
reasoning behind the 
controversy about the 
experiment. They should 
then describe Marjerus’s
