 
that are otherwise: 
• Too big (such as the biosphere)
• Too slow (macroevolution)
• Too remote in time (early extinctions)
• Too complex (human brain)
• Too small (molecular structures and interactions)
• Too fast (photosynthesis)
• Too remote in space (life in extreme environments)
• Too dangerous or unethical (how infectious agents interact with human populations)
The laboratory investigations in this manual were chosen to provide you with an 
opportunity to do biology — to explore your own questions and try to find answers to 
those questions. Many of the investigations provide a preliminary, guided exploration 
to introduce you to a way of looking at a biology problem, or method for studying it, 
providing just enough familiarity with the topics so that you can begin asking your 
own questions and investigating them. An essential part of that exploration includes an 
introduction to various quantitative skills — mathematical routines, concepts, methods, 
or operations used to in
