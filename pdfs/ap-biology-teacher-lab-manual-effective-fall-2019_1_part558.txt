ly the total amount of plasmid 
DNA used in the transformation times the fraction of DNA you spread on the LB/ 
amp plate. 
a. Calculate the total amount (mass) of plasmid DNA. 
The total amount (mass) of DNA with which you began the experiment is equal 
to the product of the concentration and the total volume used, or 
DNA in μg = (concentration of DNA of μg/μL) x (volume of DNA in μL) 
In this example, assume you used 10 μL of plasmid at a concentration of 0.005 pAMP 
μg/μL. 
•  Calculate the amount (mass) of plasmid DNA (pAMP) in μg per  
1 μL of solution. 
•  Calculate the total amount of DNA used in this experiment. 
How will you use this information? 
b. Calculate the fraction of plasmid DNA that actually got spread onto   
the LB/amp plate.  
Since not all the DNA you added to the bacterial cells will be transferred to the 
agar plate, you need to calculate what fraction of the DNA was actually spread 
onto the LB/amp plate. 
   
Fraction of DNA used = Volume spread on the LB/am
