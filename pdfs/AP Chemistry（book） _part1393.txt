the number of elec-
tron domains surrounding the middle atom in the angle. The 
ideal angle corresponds to the electron-domain geometry around 
the atom. The angle will be compressed somewhat by nonbond-
ing electrons or multiple bonds.
Solve In H ¬ O¬C, the O atom has four electron domains (two 
bonding, two nonbonding). The electron-domain geometry around 
O is therefore tetrahedral, which gives an ideal angle of 109.5°. 
The H ¬O¬ C angle is compressed somewhat by the nonbonding 
pairs, so we expect this angle to be slightly less than 109.5°.
To predict the O¬C ¬C bond angle, we examine the middle 
atom in the angle. In the molecule, there are three atoms bonded 
to this C atom and no nonbonding pairs, and so it has three elec-
tron domains about it. The predicted electron-domain geometry is 
trigonal planar, resulting in an ideal bond angle of 120°. Because 
of the larger size of the C “ C domain, the bond angle should be 
slightly greater than 120°.
