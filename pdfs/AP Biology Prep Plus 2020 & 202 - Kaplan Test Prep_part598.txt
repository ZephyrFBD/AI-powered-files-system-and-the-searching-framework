the caudal region, so the forelimb will develop in the caudal
region.

4. The figure shows the expression of four diﬀerent genes associated
with hindlimb development in honeybee workers and queens.
The developmental stages shown are those most critical for
hindlimb development, which is believed to begin around stage
L4.
Which gene appears to be most important for the diﬀerence in
hindlimb development in workers compared with queens, and
why?
Adapted from Ana Durvalina Bomtorin et al., “Hox Gene
Expression Leads to Differential Hind Leg Development
between Honeybee Castes,” PLoS ONE 7, no. 7 (July
2012): e40111.
The atx-2 gene is probably the most important for worker
hindlimb specialization because it is expressed the most in
workers at the L4 stage.
