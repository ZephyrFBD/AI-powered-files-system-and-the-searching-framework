ng divergence, as 
fish from a common ancestor faced different 
selective pressures in environments of 
different osmolarity. 
(B) The differences resulted from the evolution 
of kidneys in independent evolutionary 
lineages that were adapted to different 
environmental conditions. 
(C) The differences are accidents of evolutionary 
divergence and are unrelated to the osmotic 
differences in freshwater and marine 
environments. 
(D) The differences arise in each generation 
because of the physiological adjustment 
  
of individual fish to fluctuating salt 
concentrations in the environments in  
which they live.

 Malaria is caused by several different species of 
Plasmodium, a protozoan parasite. Plasmodium 
 
resistance to the common drugs used to treat 
malaria has increased in recent years.  
In a scientific study, Plasmodium samples were 
analyzed in blood drawn from a large number of 
infected patients before drug treatment and 
subsequently from the subset of infected patie
