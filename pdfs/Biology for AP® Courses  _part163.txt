als are closely related, orbitals provide a more
accurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and
special orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy.

Use the periodic table to describe what a Bohr model of Fluorine (F) would look like and explain why the Bohr model
is not an accurate representation of the electron orbitals in fluorine.
a.
A Bohr model would have 2 electron rings, and a Bohr model would not give information about atomic mass
b.
A Bohr model would have one electron ring, and a Bohr model would not show the sub-shells of first ring
c.
A Bohr model would have 2 electron rings, and a Bohr model would not show the sub-shell of second ring
