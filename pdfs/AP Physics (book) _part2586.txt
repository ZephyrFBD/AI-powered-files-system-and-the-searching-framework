lection
equals the angle of incidence. This law of reflection explains why
mirrors can form images.
In a plane mirror, the image is virtual, upright, the same size
as the object, and as far behind the mirror as the object is in front.
A spherical mirror can be concave or convex. A concave
spherical mirror focuses parallel rays of light (light from a very
distant object) to a point called the focal point. The distance of
this point from the mirror is the focal length f of the mirror and

where r is the radius of curvature of the mirror.
Parallel rays falling on a convex mirror reflect from the
mirror as if they diverged from a common point behind the
mirror. The distance of this point from the mirror is the focal
length and is considered negative for a convex mirror.
For a given object, the approximate position and size of the
image formed by a mirror can be found by ray tracing. Algebrai-
cally, the relation between image and object distances,
and 
and the focal length f, is give
