What are the oxidation numbers of the elements in the nitrite ion, NO2
- ?
In any redox reaction, both oxidation and reduction must occur. If one substance 
is oxidized, another must be reduced. The substance that oxidizes another substance is 
called either the oxidizing agent or the oxidant. The oxidizing agent acquires elec-
trons from the other substance and so is itself reduced. A reducing agent, or reduc-
tant, is a substance that gives up electrons, thereby causing another substance to 
be reduced. The reducing agent is therefore oxidized in the process. In Equation 20.2, 
H+1aq2, the species that is reduced, is the oxidizing agent and Zn1s2, the species that is 
oxidized, is the reducing agent.
The nickel–cadmium (nicad) battery uses the following redox reaction to generate electricity:
Cd1s2 + NiO21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ Cd1OH221s2 + Ni1OH221s2
Identify the substances that are oxidized and reduced, and indicate which is the ox
