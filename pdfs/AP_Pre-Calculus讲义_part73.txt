In this way we arrive at a point P(x, y) on the unit circle. The point P(x, y) obtained in this 
way is called the terminal point determined by the real number t. 
The circumference of the unit circle is C = 2π(1) = 2π. So if a point starts at (1, 0) and 
moves counterclockwise all the way around the unit circle and returns to (1, 0), it travels a 
distance of 2. 
Where does the point end up when it travels these distances along the circle? From the 
figure, for example, that when it travels a distance of  starting at (1, 0), its terminal point is 
(−1, 0). 
 
 
Example 2 
Find the terminal point on the unit circle determined by each real number t. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The terminal point P(x, y) determined by t=π/4  is the same distance from (1, 0) as from (0, 
1) along the unit circle.

Since the unit circle is symmetric with respect to the line y = x, it follows that P lies on the 
line y = x. 
So P is the point of intersection (in the Quadrant I) of the circle x2 +
