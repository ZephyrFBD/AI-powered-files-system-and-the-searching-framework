 researcher wants to study cancer cells from a patient
with breast cancer. Is cloning the cancer cells an option?
a.
The cancer cells should be cloned along with a
biomarker for better detection and study.
b.
The cells should be screened first in order to
assure their carcinogenic nature.
c.
The cancer cells, being clones of each other
already, should directly be grown in a culture
media and then studied.
d.
The cancer cells should be extracted using the
specific antibodies.
32. Discuss the uses of genome mapping.
a.
Genome mapping is useful in identifying human
disease-causing genes, developing microbes to
clean up pollutants, and increasing crop yield.
b.
Genome mapping is directly required to produce
recombinants, in FISH detection, and detecting
the methylated parts of genetic material.
c.
Genome mapping is useful for knowing the
pedigree of diseases in humans and tracing the
movement of transposons in plants.
d.
Genome mapping identifies human disease-
causing genes only.
