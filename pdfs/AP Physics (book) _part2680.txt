light. These are called
Newton’s rings† and they are due to interference between waves reflected by the
top and bottom surfaces of the very thin air gap between the two pieces of glass.
Because this gap (which is equivalent to a thin film) increases in width from the
central contact point out to the edges, the extra path length for the lower ray
(equal to BCD) varies. Where it equals 
and so on, it corresponds
to constructive and destructive interference; and this gives rise to the series of bright
colored circles seen in Fig. 24–31b. The color you see at a given radius corresponds
to constructive interference; at that radius, other colors partially or fully destruc-
tively interfere. (If monochromatic light is used, the rings are alternately bright
and dark.)
The point of contact of the two glass surfaces (A in Fig. 24–31a) is not bright
in Fig. 24–31b. Since the path difference is zero here, our previous analysis would
suggest that the waves reflected from each surface are in phase—s
