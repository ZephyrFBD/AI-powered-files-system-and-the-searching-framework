f visual sensitivity,
550 nm, how many photons lead to an observable flash?
19. (II) What is the longest wavelength of light that will emit
electrons from a metal whose work function is 2.90 eV?
20. (II) The work functions for sodium, cesium, copper, and iron
are 2.3, 2.1, 4.7, and 4.5 eV, respectively. Which of these
metals will not emit electrons when visible light shines on it?
21. (II) In a photoelectric-effect experiment it is observed that
no current flows unless the wavelength is less than 550 nm.
(a) What is the work function of this material? (b) What stop-
ping voltage is required if light of wavelength 400 nm is used?
