Figure 2.2 Water Molecules with Hydrogen Bonds
WATER HAS A HIGH SPECIFIC HEAT. Specific heat is the amount of
heat a substance must absorb to increase 1 gram of the substance
by 1°C. Because water has a high specific heat, large bodies of
water resist changes in temperature and provide a stable
environmental temperature for the organisms that live in them.
Furthermore, they moderate the climate of the nearby land. High
specific heat is responsible for the fact that the marine biome has
the most stable temperatures of any biome.
WATER HAS A HIGH HEAT OF VAPORIZATION. Evaporating water
requires the absorption of a relatively great amount of heat, so
evaporation of sweat significantly cools the body surface.
WATER IS THE UNIVERSAL SOLVENT. Because water is a highly polar
molecule, it dissolves all polar and ionic substances.
WATER EXHIBITS STRONG COHESION TENSION. This means that
molecules of water tend to attract one another, which results in
several biological phenome
