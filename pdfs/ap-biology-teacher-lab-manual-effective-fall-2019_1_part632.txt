techniques for studying energy dynamics in 
a biological community. Most are not accessible to the average classrooms, and the 
complexity of a typical community or ecosystem is so great that often students either 
are left with oversimplified models of the community or are confused by the overall 
complexity in the system. An alternate approach is to create a simple model system 
in the laboratory with a single producer species and a single consumer. The concepts 
learned by studying this system can then be extended to more complex, natural systems. 
Note: This investigation, as written, requires an extended amount of time to conduct 
(approximately 2â€“3 weeks) based on the different components, with each building off 
previous explorations and results.
This laboratory investigation introduces methods for estimating net terrestrial 
productivity and secondary productivity in a laboratory setting using a model plant 
species, Wisconsin Fast Plants (Brassica rapa) (http://www.fastplants.
