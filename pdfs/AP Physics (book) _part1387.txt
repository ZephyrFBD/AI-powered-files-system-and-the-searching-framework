sensitive and exquisite instruments
contained alcohol, sometimes colored,
like many thermometers today.
the speeds so high, that the molecules do not even stay close together. They move
rapidly every which way, Fig.13â€“2c, filling any container and occasionally colliding
with one another. On average, the speeds are sufficiently high in a gas that when
two molecules collide, the force of attraction is not strong enough to keep them
close together and they fly off in new directions.
Distance between atoms. The density of
copper is
and each copper atom has a mass of 63 u. Estimate
the average distance between the centers of neighboring copper atoms.
APPROACH We consider a cube of copper 1 m on a side. From the given density 
we can calculate the mass m of a cube of volume
We divide
this mass m by the mass of one atom (63 u) to obtain the number of atoms in 
We assume the atoms are in a uniform array, and we let N be the number of atoms
in a 1-m l
