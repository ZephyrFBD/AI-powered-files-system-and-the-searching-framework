 Based on water’s molecular properties, create a visual representation (e.g.,
diagrams or models) with annotations to explain how water travels up a 300-ft. California redwood tree.
What other unique properties of water are attributed to its molecular structure, and how are these properties
important to life?
pH, Buffers, Acids, and Bases
The pH of a solution indicates its acidity or alkalinity.
H2 O(l) ↔H+(aq) + OH-(aq)
litmus or pH paper, filter paper that has been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator,
to test how much acid (acidity) or base (alkalinity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to test whether the
water in a swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, the pH test measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a
given solution.
Hydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water
molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (H+) ions and hydroxide (O
