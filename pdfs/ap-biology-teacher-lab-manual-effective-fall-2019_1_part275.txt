Scroll down to the section titled “Sequences producing significant alignments.” The 
species in the list that appears below this section are those with sequences identical to 
or most similar to the gene of interest. The most similar sequences are listed first, and as 
you move down the list, the sequences become less similar to your gene of interest.

If you click on a particular species listed, you’ll get a full report that includes the 
classification scheme of the species, the research journal in which the gene was first 
reported, and the sequence of bases that appear to align with your gene of interest.
