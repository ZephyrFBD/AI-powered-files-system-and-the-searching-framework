Oxygen is carried in the blood by the respiratory pigment
hemoglobin, which can combine loosely with four oxygen
molecules, forming the molecule oxyhemoglobin. To function
properly, hemoglobin must bind to oxygen in the lungs and drop it
off at body cells. The more easily the hemoglobin binds to oxygen in
the lungs, the more difficult the oxygen is to unload at the body
cells. Below is a graph that shows two different saturation-
dissociation curves for one type of hemoglobin at two different pH
levels:
Based on your knowledge of Biology and the information provided,
which of the following statements about the hemoglobin curves is
correct?
Hemoglobin B has a greater affinity for oxygen and therefore
binds more easily to oxygen in the lungs.
Hemoglobin A is characteristic of a mammal that evolved at
sea level where oxygen levels are high.
