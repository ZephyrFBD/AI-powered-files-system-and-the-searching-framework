ng individuals in a population. Most traits reveal considerable variety in their form. In
humans, for example, skin, hair, and eye color occur as continuous variation from very dark to very light.
6. Much variation is heritable. Although Darwin was unaware of the mechanism for heredity, he recognized that
traits were passed from parents to offspring. This contrasts with characteristics acquired during the life of an
organism as a result of environmental influences. The amputation of a limb or characteristics acquired as the result
of exposure to pathogens or radiation, for example, are not heritable. We now know that most traits are produced by
the action of enzymes that are coded by DNA, the hereditary information that is passed from generation to
generation.
7. Only the most fit individuals survive. “Survival of the fittest” occurs because individuals with traits best
adapted for survival and reproduction are able to out compete other individuals for resources and mates.
