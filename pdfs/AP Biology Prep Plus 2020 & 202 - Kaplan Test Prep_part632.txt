15.3 Explain and predict results of Mendelian inheritance
Now consider two genes and an individual that is homozygous for both
(AABB). Although there are two genes to consider, the organism still
produces four gametes from a single parent cell. Each gamete gets an A
allele and a B allele. What is the probability that a gamete will have both
an A and B allele? Four out of four will have an A and four out of four will
have a B so all (four out of four) will have AB (
 ).
If the individual is heterozygous for one of the genes (AABb), the
probability of the A allele stays the same, but now only half of the
gametes get a B allele (
) and the other two get a b allele. What is
the probability of producing a gamete with both an A and B allele from
this individual? Four out of four will have an A and two out of four will
have a B, so only half (two out of four) will have AB (
 ).
If the individual is heterozygous for both genes (AaBb), the probability of
each allele in the gametes (A, a, B, or
