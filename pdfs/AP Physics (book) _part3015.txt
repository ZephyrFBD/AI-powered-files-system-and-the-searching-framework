27–4 Energy, Mass, and
Momentum of a Photon
We have just seen (Eq. 27–4) that the total energy of a single photon is given by
Because a photon always travels at the speed of light, it is truly a rela-
tivistic particle. Thus we must use relativistic formulas for dealing with its mass,
energy, and momentum. The mome
