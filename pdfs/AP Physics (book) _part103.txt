e to the base of the building with big, 1-m-long steps, and
you get a total of 16 steps or 16 m.
SOLUTION Now you draw, to scale, the diagram shown in Fig. 1–12b using
these measurements. You can measure, right on the diagram, the last side of
the triangle to be about
Alternatively, you can use similar triangles
to obtain the height x:
so
Finally you add in your eye height of 1.5 m above the ground to get your final
result: the building is about 15 m tall.

ESTIMATE
Another approach, this one made famous by Enrico Fermi (1901–1954,
Fig. 1–13), was to show his students how to estimate the number of piano tuners in
a city, say, Chicago or San Francisco. To get a rough order-of-magnitude estimate
of the number of piano tuners today in San Francisco, a city of about 800,000
inhabitants, we can proceed by estimating the number of functioning pianos,
how often each piano is tuned, and how many pianos each tuner can tune. To
estimate th
