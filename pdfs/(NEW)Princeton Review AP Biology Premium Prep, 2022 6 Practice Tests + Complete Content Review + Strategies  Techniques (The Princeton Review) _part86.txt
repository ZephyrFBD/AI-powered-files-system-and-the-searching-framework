 AP Biology Exam.
Be Calculating
Students may use a four-function, scientific, or graphing calculator. However,
be aware that some models have unapproved features (like keyboards,
styluses, or wireless capability) and are not permitted, so please check the
College Board website. If you’re still unsure, you can bring two calculators so
that if one is rejected (or not functioning), you do not have to rely on a school-
provided backup that you may be unfamiliar with.
HOW THE AP BIOLOGY EXAM IS SCORED
For your reference, here is the College Board’s score distribution data from the 2019 and 2020 AP Biology Exam
administrations.
Though the percentile breakdowns do not drastically differ from those in 2019, we have included the results from both years due to the unprecedented
nature of the 2020 AP administration, which featured a truncated, at-home version of the exam. It is likely that 2021’s results will be graded on a similar
curve.
