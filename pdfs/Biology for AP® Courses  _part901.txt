es among these abiotic and biotic processes in
terms of the changes in entropy and heat that contribute to
the free energy extracted from chemical bonds, the
spontaneity of each, and the role of catalysis.
54. A. [Extension] Living systems require free energy to
carry out cellular functions, and employ various strategies
to capture, use, and store free energy. Explain the
advantage that the higher energy efficiency per kg of the
Krebs cycle provides to you compared to a metabolism
based on glycolysis alone. Your explanation should make
use of all the following facts:
•
ΔG for glycolysis is -135kJ per mole of glucose
•
ΔG for aerobic respiration is -2880kJ per mole
glucose
•
the basal metabolic rate of mammals is often
represented as -300kJ/day • m0.75
•
the molar mass of glucose is 180 g/mole
B. Explain the bioenergetic difference between aerobic
and anaerobic respiration in terms of the difference
between free-energy production and power. Your
explanation should make use of all the fo
