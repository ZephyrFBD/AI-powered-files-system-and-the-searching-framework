Administration of this compound more than doubled the life spans of 
treated mice.
Compounds such as this one are not suitable for use in treating 
prion disease in humans, but studies conducted thus far point the 
way toward discovery of molecules that might in the future provide

Slowing a Progressive Disease. Proteins are very large molecules 
that play an essential role in biology and the functioning of living organ-
isms. Out of the myriad different types of proteins, scientists have identified 
one class of proteins called prions that play an important role in certain neu-
