 give it centripetal acceleration. The
magnitude of the required force can be calculated using Newton’s second law for
the radial component,
where 
is the centripetal acceleration,
and 
is the total (or net) force in the radial direction:
[circular motion]
(5;3)
For uniform circular motion 
the acceleration is 
which is
directed toward the center of the circle at all times. Thus the net force too must 
be directed toward the center of the circle (Fig. 5–4). A net force is necessary
because if no net force were exerted on the object, it would not move in a circle
but in a straight line, as Newton’s first law tells us. The direction of the net force
is continually changing so that it is always directed toward the center of the circle.
This force is sometimes called a centripetal (“pointing toward the center”) force.
But be aware that “centripetal force” does not indicate some new kind of force.
The term “centripetal force” merely describes the direction of the net force needed
to provide
