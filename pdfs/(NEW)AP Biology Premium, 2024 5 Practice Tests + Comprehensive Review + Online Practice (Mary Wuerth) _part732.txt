 case in this example. Polygenic
inheritance is when more than one gene contributes to a trait, also not the case here, so choice (C) is incorrect.
Choice (D) is incorrect because temporal isolation requires that the species breed at different times.
11. (B) Punctuated equilibrium describes long periods of stability during evolution interspersed with periods of
rapid change. Choice (A) is incorrect because gradualism describes a slow, constant rate of evolutionary
change. Convergent evolution occurs when species share similar traits because of similar environments, not
common ancestry, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because coevolution occurs when two
species influence each otherâ€™s evolution.
12. (D) Natural selection occurs when the natural environment determines which individuals survive and reproduce
at a greater rate. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because both are examples of artificial selection, when
humans breed organisms for desired traits. The darkenin
