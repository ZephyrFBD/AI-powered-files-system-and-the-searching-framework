Baseball Curve
Why a spinning pitched baseball (or tennis ball) curves can also be explained
using Bernoulli’s principle. It is simplest if we put ourselves in the reference
frame of the ball, with the air rushing by, just as we did for the airplane wing.
Suppose the ball is rotating counterclockwise as seen from above, Fig. 10–27.
A thin layer of air (“boundary layer”) is being dragged around by the ball. We are
looking down on the ball, and at point A in Fig. 10–27, this boundary layer tends
to slow down the oncoming air. At point B, the air rotating with the ball adds 
its speed to that of the oncoming air, so the air speed is higher at B than at A.
The higher speed at B means the pressure is lower at B than at A, resulting in a
net force toward B. The ball’s path curves toward the left (as seen by the pitcher).
