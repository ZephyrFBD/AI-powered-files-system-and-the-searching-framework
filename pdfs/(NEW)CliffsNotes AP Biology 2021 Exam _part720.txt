 population is subject to a limiting resource, there is likely to be competition. In order to
minimize conflict, the result of competition is often to distribute the resource equally among all individuals in a
population. By equally apportioning space, the penguins minimize conflict. The desert shrubs minimize competition
for water. Tropical trees of a single species are also uniformly spaced through the forest, not because of competition,
but probably because it minimizes the effect of herbivory and the transmission of parasites and disease. The greater
the distance between trees, the more difficulty herbivores have in locating a tree.
6. C. The rate of growth, r, equals
 
, or 0.1/year. 7. A. If the reproductive rate is greater than zero (r > 0), then the population is growing
exponentially.
8. A. This is an example of commensalism because the seeds are helped (dispersal occurs) and the mammals are not
harmed or helped by the seeds.
9. C. This is an example of Batesian mimicry becaus
