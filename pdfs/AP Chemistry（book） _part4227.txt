he amount of A decreases. So we would 
guess that the change from 20 s to 30 s is greater than the change 
from 30 s to 40 s, and we would estimate that the number of moles 
of A is between 0.42 and 0.30 mol. Figure 14.3 The instantaneous 
rate decreases as the reaction proceeds. Figure 14.7 The reaction 
is first order. Figure 14.9 At the beginning of the reaction when 
both plots are linear or nearly so. Figure 14.13 No, it will not turn 
down. The rate constant increases monotonically with increasing 
temperature because the kinetic energy of the colliding molecules 
continues to increase. Figure 14.15 The difference in height 
between the ball and the top of the barrier. Figure 14.16 As 
shown, the magnitude of energy needed to overcome the energy bar-
rier is greater than the magnitude of the energy change in the reac-
tion. Figure 14.17 It would be more spread out, the maximum of 
the curve would be lower and to the right of the maximum of the red 
curve, and a greater fraction o
