n the structure of an enzyme changes, it may no longer function.
b. (2 points maximum)
1 pt: When a protein is heated, as when it is cooked, the protein structure is disrupted (denatured).
1 pt: When immersed in a strong acid, the structure of a protein will be disrupted (denatured), much like that which
results from the application of heat (cooking).
1 pt: Denatured proteins are often insoluble and coagulate (form solids); (denatured fish proteins change from a
translucent, gellike texture to a solid, opaque texture).
Question 4 (4 points maximum)
(4 points maximum, 2 points maximum for each mechanism)
 
1. Indeterminate and determinate cleavages
1 pt: An indeterminate cleavage produces daughter cells that, if separated, can individually complete normal
development.
1 pt: A determinate cleavage produces daughter cells that are limited to the development of definite (or determined)
cells that contribute to only a part of a complete embryo.
2. Influence of the egg cytoplasm (cytoplasmic
