 (a) Propanol can engage in hydrogen bonding. 
(b) While both molecules are somewhat polar, we expect propanol 
to have a larger dipole moment because of its O–H bond. (c) Propa-
nol boils at 97.2 °C, while ethyl methyl ether boils at 10.8 °C. The 
stronger intermolecular forces in propanol cause it to have the higher 
boiling point. 11.9 (a) Solid 6 liquid 6 gas (b) gas 6 liquid 6 solid 
(c) Matter in the gaseous state is most easily compressed because 
particles are far apart and there is much empty space. 11.11 (a) It 
increases. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. As melting occurs, 
the motion of atoms relative to each other increases. (b) It increases 
somewhat. The density of liquid lead is less than the density of solid 
lead. The smaller density means a greater sample volume and greater 
average distance between atoms in three dimensions. 11.13 (a) The 
molar volumes of Cl2 and NH3 are nearly the same because they are 
both gases. (b) On cooling to 160 K, both compounds co
