An amorphous solid, known as quartz glass or silica glass, results. Many substances can 
be added to SiO2 to cause it to melt at a lower temperature. The common glass used in 
windows and bottles, known as soda-lime glass, contains CaO and Na2O in addition to 
SiO2 from sand. The CaO and Na2O are produced by heating two inexpensive chemicals, 
limestone 1CaCO32 and soda ash 1Na2CO32, which decompose at high temperatures:
 
CaCO31s2 ¡ CaO1s2 + CO21g2 
[22.68]
 
Na2CO31s2 ¡ Na2O1s2 + CO21g2 
[22.69]
Other substances can be added to soda-lime glass to produce color or to change the 
properties of the glass in various ways. The addition of CoO, for example, produces the 
deep blue color of “cobalt glass.” Replacing Na2O with K2O results in a harder glass that 
has a higher melting point. Replacing CaO with PbO results in a denser “lead crystal” glass 
with a higher refractive index. Lead crystal is used for decorative glassware; the higher
