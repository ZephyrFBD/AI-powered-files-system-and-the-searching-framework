and the cathode is carbon. Electric cars need no gear changes and can develop
full torque starting from rest, and so can accelerate quickly and smoothly. The
distance an electric car can go between charges of the battery (its “range”) is an
important parameter because each recharging of an electric car battery may take
hours, not minutes like a gas fill-up. Because charging an electric car can draw 
a large current over a period of several hours, electric power companies 
may need to upgrade their power grids so they won’t fail when many electric cars
are being charged at the same time in a small urban area.
