sister chromatids lined up on the metaphase plate. There can be no
crossing-over because there is only one chromosome.
(C) It is clear from the first cross that the red and smooth traits are
dominant. The results of the testcross show a phenotypic ratio of
1:1:1:1 in the offspring. This could only have happened if there was
independent assortment of the trait for color and the trait for pod
character. Here is the testcross: RrSs × rrss
(C) A soil with an acidic pH causes the flowers to be pink; a basic
soil gives rise to blue flowers. ABO blood type is an example of
codominance because both A and B genes show. Polygenic
inheritance is characteristic of traits like skin color, hair color, and
height that exist in a complete spectrum.

(D) By analyzing the F1 results, you see that there is almost a 50-50
ratio of Gray/Normal to Black/Vestigial. The 50–50 ratio of those
traits tells you that the traits are linked.
