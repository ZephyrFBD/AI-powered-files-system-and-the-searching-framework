at students practice and work with several different 
types of problems that employ statistical analysis of data. 
■ Hypothesis Testing 
Hypothesis testing is informed with statistical analysis, which helps to distinguish 
between multiple working hypotheses. Students just beginning to design and carry out 
their own investigations tend to propose only a single hypothesis as a causal model. 
However, nature is not always so cooperative. It is important that students, as they 
develop more expert inquiry skills, learn to propose and investigate all possibilities for 
a particular phenomenon wherever possible, and to design experiments to eliminate 
all but one competing hypothesis. Within this manual there are several labs in which 
students will engage in hypothesis testing. However, discrete examples for application 
can be used to prepare students. 
Here’s an example: Leopard frogs have polymorphic patterns on their skins designated 
as 
 pipiens, mottled, burnsi, or kandiyohi phenot
