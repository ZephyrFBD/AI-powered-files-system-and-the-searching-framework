eptide. The most stable tertiary structures will
have hydrophilic R-groups on the surface of the protein (in contact with the watery environment of the cellâ€™s
cytosol), while the amino acids with hydrophobic R-groups will be found in the interior of the protein (away from
the watery cytosol). Tertiary structures may also include disulfide bridges between sulfur atoms. Special proteins
called chaperonins often help fold a polypeptide into its three-dimensional structure.
Quaternary Structure
Some proteins consist of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits), which are joined together to form the complete
protein and function as a unit. For example, hemoglobin has four subunits in its quaternary structure, and collagen
has three subunits in its quaternary structure.
Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are polymers of nucleotides, as shown in Figure 4.7. The genetic information is
stored and communicated through the order of these nucleotides. Nucleotides consist of a five-carbon sugar
