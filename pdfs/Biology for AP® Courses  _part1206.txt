Mutational signatures of p53 are shown in the
figure above [G.P. Pfeifer et al., Nature, 21(48),
2002] for the three types of cancer with the
highest death rates in the U.S.: lung (~225,000
deaths in 2016), breast (246,000), and colorectal
(381,000). These data can be obtained by
sequencing the gene that encodes p53.
Approximately 85% of lung cancers occur in
smokers. Based on these data, calculate how
many deaths due to lung cancer among
nonsmokers were reported in 2016. How much
does smoking increase the likelihood of death
due to lung cancer?
D.
As shown under each graph, particular
transversions (replacement of a pyrimidine by a
purine of vice versa) or transitions (replacement
of a purine or pyrimidine by the alternative
purine or pyrimidine) are features of specific
mutational signatures. Based on these data,
identify the transversion or transition that seems
to be induced by cigarette smoke.
