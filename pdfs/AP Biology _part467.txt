Dating Fossils Older than 75,000 Years
We may be able to date fossils older than 75,000 years indirectly if the
ancient fossils are embedded in volcanic rock. Lava, as it cools, may
absorb and trap radioisotopes from the surrounding environment. If fossils
are sandwiched between two layers of volcanic rock and if we can date the
two layers by a similar means as discussed above, then we know the age
range of the fossils. If two volcanic layers surrounding fossils are
determined to be 490 and 495 million years old (myo), then we know the
age of the fossils to be between 490 and 495 myo.
Calculate Half-Life Problem
A sample contains 100.0 g of thorium-234. After 96.4 days, there is 6.25 g
remaining of Th-234. Calculate the half-life of Th-234. Follow this
procedure.
First, determine how many half-lives have passed to get from 100.0 g to
6.25 g: 100.0 g divided by 2 = 50.0 g; divided by 2 again = 25.0 g; divided
again by 2 = 12.5 g; and divided again by
