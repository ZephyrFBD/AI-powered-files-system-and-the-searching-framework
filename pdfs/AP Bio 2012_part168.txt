s ∆N/∆T, 
where ∆N=change in population size and ∆T=time interval. In other words, ∆N/∆T = 
900 individuals-200 individuals/2 days=700 individuals/2 days. However, the mean rate of 
population growth is for 1 day, or 350 individuals/day. 
Question 2
Essential Knowledge
3.A.3: The chromosomal basis of inheritance provides an 
understanding of the pattern of passage (transmission) of 
genes from parent to offspring.
Science Practice
2.2: The student can apply mathematical routines to 
quantities that describe natural phenomena.
Learning Objective 
3.14: The student is able to apply mathematical routines 
to determine Mendelian patterns of inheritance provided 
by data.
The correct answer is 5.3–5.4. If the purple-flowered parent was heterozygous for the trait 
(Pp) and the other parent had yellow flowers (pp), the EXPECTED ratios for the cross Pp 
x pp is 1 purple-flowered: 1 yellow-flowered. From 146 offspring, 73 would be expected to 
have purple flowers (Pp), and 73 would be expected
