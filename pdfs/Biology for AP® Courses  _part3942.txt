at has not been encountered before, called a primary
response, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells
mature into effector cells, a subset of the na√Øve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen
specificities, as illustrated in Figure 33.16.
A memory cell is an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary
immune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. During the
primary immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. As the infection
is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the
memory cells persist in the circulation.
