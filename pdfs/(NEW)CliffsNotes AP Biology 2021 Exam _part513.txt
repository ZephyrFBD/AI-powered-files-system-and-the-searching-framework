ll, or neuron. It consists of the following parts:
 
1. The cell body contains the nucleus and other cellular organelles. 2. The dendrite is typically a short, abundantly
branched, slender extension of the cell body that receives stimuli.
 
3. The axon is typically a long, slender extension of the cell body that sends nerve impulses.
A nerve impulse begins at the tips of the dendrite branches, passes through the dendrites to the cell body, then
through the axon, and finally terminates at branches of the axon.
Neurons can be classified into three general groups by their functions:
1. Sensory neurons (or afferent neurons) receive the initial stimulus. For example, sensory neurons embedded in
the retina of the eye are stimulated by light, while certain sensory neurons in the hand are stimulated by touch.
2. Motor neurons (or efferent neurons) stimulate effectors, target cells that produce some kind of response. For
example, motor neurons may stimulate muscles (creating a movement to maint
