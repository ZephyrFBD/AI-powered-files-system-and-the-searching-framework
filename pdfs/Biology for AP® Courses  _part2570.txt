ia added to the soil. The
seedlingsâ€™ uptake of the nutrient potassium increased
dramatically in the soil with Strain 1 and decreased
dramatically in the soil with Strain 2. What specific and
broad inferences about the relationship between the
bacteria, the seedlings, and available nutrients can you
make?
a.
The Strain 2 bacteria increased the availability
of potassium in the soil and this nutrient was
needed and used by the seedlings in the soil. The
Strain 1 bacteria decreased the availability of
potassium in the soil.
b.
The soil with Strain 1 bacteria must have had
more potassium in comparison to soil with
Strain 2 bacteria. The seedlings took up more
potassium in Soil 1 than in 2 due to this.
c.
The Strain 1 bacteria increased the availability
of potassium in the soil and this nutrient was
needed and used by the seedlings in the soil. The
Strain 2 bacteria decreased the availability of
potassium in the soil.
d.
The Strain 1 bacteria decreased the availability
of potassium in the so
