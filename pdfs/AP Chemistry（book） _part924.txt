nature. This limit has no 
practical consequences when dealing with ordinary-sized objects, 
but its implications are enormous when dealing with subatomic 
particles, such as electrons.
To measure an object, we must disturb it, at least a little, with 
our measuring device. Imagine using a flashlight to locate a large 
rubber ball in a dark room. You see the ball when the light from 
the flashlight bounces off the ball and strikes your eyes. When a 
beam of photons strikes an object of this size, it does not alter its 
position or momentum to any practical extent. Imagine, however, 
 
that you wish to locate an electron by similarly bouncing light 
off it into some detector. Objects can be located to an accuracy

In 1926, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) proposed an equation, 
now known as Schrödinger’s wave equation, that incorporates both the wave-like and
