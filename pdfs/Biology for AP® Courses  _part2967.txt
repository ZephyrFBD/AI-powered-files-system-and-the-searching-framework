estive process. The
animal diet needs carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance.
How each of these components is digested is discussed in the following sections.
Carbohydrates
The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches
into maltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion
of carbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The
acidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.
The next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the
duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain
amylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide
