is correct because crickets are ectotherms. Ectotherms have very 
low metabolic rates, so they depend on the environment to help regulate their 
internal temperature. Therefore, crickets would have a higher metabolic rate at 
the higher temperature due to kinetics or more frequent molecular collisions.
(D)
This option is incorrect because both organisms produce ATP via aerobic cellular 
respiration when oxygen is not a limiting reactant.

Question 20
Essential Knowledge
1.B.1: Organisms share many conserved core processes 
and features that evolved and are widely distributed 
among organisms today. 
Science Practice
7.2: The student can connect concepts in and across 
domain(s) to generalize or extrapolate in and/or across 
enduring understandings and/or big ideas.
Learning Objective 
1.15: The student is able to describe specific examples of 
conserved core biological processes and features shared by 
all domains or within one domain of life, and how these 
shared, conserve
