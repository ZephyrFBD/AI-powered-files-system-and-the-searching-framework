for Benedict’s test, so it contains glucose. The correct answer is (A). (B)
is incorrect because a solution containing albumin would test positive
for Biuret, not for Benedict’s. (C) is incorrect because a solution
containing glucose would test positive for Benedict’s, not for Biuret.
(D) is incorrect because solution 5 did not test positive for Biuret.
37. A
Since a more intense color indicates a higher concentration in
solution, a pink color (less intense) in the Biuret test indicates the
concentration of peptide bonds is low. Thus, solution 7 contains short-
chain peptides. The correct answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because a
high concentration of peptide bonds would result in a more intense
purple color. (C) and (D) are incorrect because peptide bonds are not
