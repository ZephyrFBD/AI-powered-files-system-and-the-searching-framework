 the following correctly describes the regulation of 
the Trp operon? 
(A) In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor is active and binds to the Trp operator, preventing RNA 
polymerase from transcribing the operon. 
(B) In the presence of tryptophan, the repressor is active and binds to the Trp operator, preventing RNA 
polymerase from transcribing the operon. 
(C) In the absence of tryptophan, the trpR gene is inactive, preventing the production of the repressor that 
blocks expression of the operon. 
(D) In the presence of tryptophan, the trpR gene is inactive, preventing the production of the repressor that 
blocks expression of the operon.
