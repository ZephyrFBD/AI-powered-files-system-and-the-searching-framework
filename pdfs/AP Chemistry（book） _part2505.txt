Acids and bases are among the most important substances in chemistry, 
and they affect our daily lives in innumerable ways. Not only are they 
present in our foods, but acids and bases are also crucial components of 
living systems, such as the amino acids that are used to synthesize pro-
teins and the nucleic acids that code genetic information. Both citric 
and malic acids are among several acids involved in the Krebs cycle (also 
called the citric acid cycle) that is used to generate energy in aerobic 
organisms. The application of acid–base chemistry has also had critical 
roles in shaping modern society, including such human-driven activi-
ties as industrial manufacturing, the creation of advanced pharmaceuti-
cals, and many aspects of the environment.
The impact of acids and bases depends not only on the type of acid 
or base, but also on how much is present. The time r
