used to measure the speed of
light. Among the most important were those carried out by the American Albert A.
Michelson (1852–1931). Michelson used the rotating mirror apparatus diagrammed

in Fig. 22–10 for a series of high-precision experiments carried out from 1880 to
the 1920s. Light from a source would hit one face of a rotating eight-sided mirror.
The reflected light traveled to a stationary mirror a large distance away and back
again as shown. If the rotating mirror was turning at just the right rate, the return-
ing beam of light would reflect from one face of the mirror into a small telescope
through which the observer looked. If the speed of rotation was only slightly 
different, the beam would be deflected to one side and would not be seen by the
observer. From the required speed of the rotating mirror and the known distance
to the stationary mirror, the speed of light could be calculated. In the 1920s,
Michelson set up the rotating mirror
