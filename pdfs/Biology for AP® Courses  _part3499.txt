of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other
causing pain. RA is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually 40–50 years of age.
Rheumatologists can diagnose RA on the basis of symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain, X-ray and
MRI imaging, and blood tests. Arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent,
such as a dye, that is opaque to X-rays. This allows the soft tissue structures of joints—such as cartilage,
tendons, and ligaments—to be visualized. An arthrogram differs from a regular X-ray by showing the surface
of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. An arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in
joint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected.
There is currently no cure for RA; however, rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available.
Early stages can be treated with rest of the affected joints by using a cane or by using joint splints that
minimize inflammation. When i
