 of 2p orbitals make with each 
other? (c) How many antibonding orbitals, and of what type, 
can be made from the two sets of 2p orbitals?
 9.74  Indicate whether each statement is true or false. (a) s orbitals 
can only make s or s* molecular orbitals. (b) The probability 
is 100% for finding an electron at the nucleus in a p* orbital. 
(c) Antibonding orbitals are higher in energy than bonding 
orbitals (if all orbitals are created from the same atomic orbit-
als). (d) Electrons cannot occupy an antibonding orbital.
 9.75 (a) What are the relationships among bond order, bond 
length, and bond energy? (b) According to molecular orbital 
theory, would either Be2 or Be2
+ be expected to exist? Explain.
 9.76  Explain the following: (a) The peroxide ion, O2
2 -, has a longer 
bond length than the superoxide ion, O2
-. (b) The magnetic 
properties of B2 are consistent with the p
2p  MOs being lower 
in energy than the s
2p MO. (c) The O2
2 +  ion has a stronger 
Oâ€”O bond than O2  itself.
