 would expect the last two electrons to go into the p
2p 
MOs with the same spin, which would cause C2 to be paramagnetic.

page 397 No. The heaviest gas in Table 10.1 is SO2, whose molar 
mass, 64 g>mol, is less than half that of Xe, whose molar mass is 
131 g>mol. page 398 (a) 6.2 * 103 N, (b) 1.5 * 103 N page 398

Answers to Give It Some Thought
to increase with increasing partial pressure. page 574 You can  
see visually that the slope of the line connecting 0 s and 600 s is 
smaller than the slope at 0 s and larger than the slope at 600 s.  
The order from fastest to slowest is therefore (ii) 7  (i) 7  (iii).  
page 577 No, the reaction rate usually depends on concentra-
tion but the rate constant does not. page 577 Generally no. Rate 
always has units of M>s. The units of the rate constant depend on 
the specific rate law, as we shall see throughout this chapter.  
page 578 The reaction rate will double because the rate law is  
first order in [H2]. page 585 After
