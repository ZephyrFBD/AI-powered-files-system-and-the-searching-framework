 set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation and sweating when
the body is too warm, or vasoconstriction and shivering when the body is too cold. It responds to chemicals from the body.
When a bacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes, chemicals called endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood.
These pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the thermostat. This allows the body’s temperature to increase in
what is commonly called a fever. An increase in body temperature causes iron to be conserved, which reduces a nutrient
needed by bacteria. An increase in body heat also increases the activity of the animal’s enzymes and protective cells while
inhibiting the enzymes and activity of the invading microorganisms. Finally, heat itself may also kill the pathogen. A fever
that was once thought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism.
