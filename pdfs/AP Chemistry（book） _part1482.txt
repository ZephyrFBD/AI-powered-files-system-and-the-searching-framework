and the average bond enthalpies in Table 8.3:
 
∆Hrxn = 8 D1S ¬ S2 - 4 D1S “ S2
 
    = 81266 kJ2 - 41418 kJ2 = +456 kJ
 
Recall that D1X¬Y2 represents the X¬Y bond enthalpy. 
Because ∆Hrxn 7 0, the reaction is endothermic (Section 5.3). 
The very positive value of ∆Hrxn suggests that high tempera-
tures are required to cause the reaction to occur.
Elemental sulfur is a yellow solid that consists of S8 molecules. The structure of the S8 molecule is a puckered, eight-
membered ring (see Figure 7.27). Heating elemental sulfur to high temperatures produces gaseous S2 molecules:
S81s2 ¡ 4 S21g2
(a) The electron configuration of which period 2 element is most similar to that of sulfur? (b) Use the VSEPR model to pre-
dict the S¬ S¬ S bond angles in S8 and the hybridization at S in S8. (c) Use MO theory to predict the sulfur–sulfur bond 
order in S2. Do you expect this molecule to be diamagnetic or paramagnetic? (d) Use average bond enthalpies (Table 8.3) to 
estimate the enthalp
