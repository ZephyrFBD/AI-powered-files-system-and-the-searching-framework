ponse. The requirement for
information from the APCs of innate immunity to trigger B cell or T cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the
innate immune response to the functioning of the entire immune system.
Figure 33.10 An antigen is a macromolecule that reacts with components of the immune system. A given antigen may
contain several motifs that are recognized by immune cells. Each motif is an epitope. In this figure, the entire structure
is an antigen, and the orange, salmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes.
Naïve T cells can express one of two different molecules, CD4 or CD8, on their surface, as shown in Figure 33.11, and
are accordingly classified as CD4+ or CD8+ cells. These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will
interact with and respond to an APC. Naïve CD4+ cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and
are stimulated to become helper T (TH) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate B
