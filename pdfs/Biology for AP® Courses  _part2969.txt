Protein
A large part of protein digestion takes place in the stomach. The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion
of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides, which are short chains of four to nine amino acids. In the
duodenum, other enzymes—trypsin, elastase, and chymotrypsin—act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides.
