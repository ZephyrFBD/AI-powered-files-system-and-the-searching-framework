doorway?
64. Suppose that the spectrum of an unknown element shows
a series of lines with one out of every four matching a line
from the Lyman series of hydrogen. Assuming that the
unknown element is an ion with Z protons and one
electron, determine Z and the element in question.
*65. Photons of wavelength 0.154 nm are emitted from the
surface of a certain metal when it is bombarded with high-
energy radiation. If this photon wavelength corresponds to
the 
line, what is the element?

1. Use the uncertainty principle to estimate the position uncer-
tainty for the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen
atom. [Hint: Determine the momentum using the Bohr
model of Section 27â€“12 and assume the momentum can 
be anywhere between this value and zero.] How does this
result compare to the Bohr
