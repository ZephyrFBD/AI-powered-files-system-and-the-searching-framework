eral, various chemical processes must be performed 
to reduce the metal to its elemental form. Metallurgy is the science and technology 
of extracting metals from their natural sources and preparing them for practical use. It 
usually involves several steps: (1) mining, that is, removing the relevant ore (a mixture of 
minerals) from the ground, (2) concentrating the ore or otherwise preparing it for fur-
ther treatment, (3) reducing the ore to obtain the free metal, (4) purifying the metal, and 
(5) mixing it with other elements to modify its properties. This last process produces an 
alloy, a metallic material composed of two or more elements.

Physical Properties
Some physical properties of the period 4 (also known as “first-row”) transition metals are 
listed in Table 23.2. The properties of the heavier transition metals vary similarly across 
periods 5 and 6.

packed metallic structures as a function of group nu
