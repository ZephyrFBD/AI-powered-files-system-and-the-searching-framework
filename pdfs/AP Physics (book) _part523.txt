Newton’s Synthesis
Kepler arrived at his laws through careful analysis of experimental data.
Fifty years later, Newton was able to show that Kepler’s laws could be derived
mathematically from the law of universal gravitation and the laws of motion.
Newton also showed that for any reasonable form for the gravitational force law,
only one that depends on the inverse square of the distance is fully consistent
with Kepler’s laws. He thus used Kepler’s laws as evidence in favor of his law of
universal gravitation, Eq. 5–4.
The development by Newton of the law of universal gravitation and the three
laws of motion was a major intellectual achievement. With these laws, he was
able to describe the motion of objects on Earth and of the far-away planets seen
in the night sky. The motions of the planets through the heavens and of objects
on Earth were seen to follow
