collisions. We also examine the concept of center of mass, and how it 
helps us in the study of complex motion.
7–1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force
The linear momentum (or “momentum” for short) of an object is defined as the
product of its mass and its velocity. Momentum (plural is momenta—from Latin) is
represented by the symbol 
If we let m represent the mass of an object and 
represent its velocity, then its momentum is defined as
(7;1)
Velocity is a vector, so momentum too is a vector. The direction of the momentum
is the direction of the velocity, and the magnitude of the momentum is  
Because velocity depends on the reference frame, so does momentum; thus the ref-
erence frame must be specified. The unit of momentum is that of 
which in SI units is 
There is no special name for this unit.
Everyday usage of the term momentum is in accord with the definition above.
According to Eq. 7–1, a fast-moving car has more momentum than a slow-moving
car of the same mass; a heavy truck ha
