of the emitted electrons. This can be done by
using a variable voltage source and reversing the terminals so that electrode C is
negative and P is positive. The electrons emitted from P will be repelled by the
negative electrode, but if this reverse voltage is small enough, the fastest electrons
will still reach C and there will be a current in the circuit. If the reversed voltage
is increased, a point is reached where the current reaches zero—no electrons
have sufficient kinetic energy to reach C. This is called the stopping potential, or
stopping voltage,
and from its measurement,
can be determined using
conservation of energy (loss of 
in potential energy):
Now let us examine the details of the photoelectric effect from the point of
view of the wave theory versus Einstein’s particle theory.
First the wave theory, assuming monochromatic light. The two important
properties of a light wave are its intensity and its frequency (or wavelength). When
these two quantities are varied, t
