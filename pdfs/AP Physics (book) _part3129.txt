time. The
more accurately we try to measure the position, so that 
is small, the greater
will be the uncertainty in momentum,
If we try to measure the momentum
very accurately, then the uncertainty in the position becomes large. The uncertainty
principle does not forbid individual precise measurements, however. For example,
in principle we could measure the position of an object exactly. But then its
momentum would be completely unknown. Thus, although we might know the
position of the object exactly at one instant, we could have no idea at all where it
would be a moment later. The uncertainties expressed here are inherent in nature,
and reflect the best precision theoretically attainable even with the best instruments.
