might be susceptible to dangerous pathogenic bacteria.
Most interactions are performed to gain energy. This can be by directly gaining
resources or by doing something else more efficiently so that more energy is
available to the organism.
PLANT BEHAVIOR
Plants have also evolved specific ways to respond to their environment. The plant behaviors covered on the AP
Biology Exam are photoperiodism and tropisms. Plants flower in response to changes in the amount of daylight and
darkness they receive. This is called photoperiodism. Although you’d think that plants bloom based on the amount
of sunlight they receive, they actually flower according to the amount of uninterrupted darkness.
Tropisms
