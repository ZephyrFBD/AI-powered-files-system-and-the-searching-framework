attacking
pathogens. Blocked glycolysis inhibits the
process of recognition, causing invasion of the
RBCs by a pathogen.
30. What is the primary difference between a circular
pathway and a linear pathway?
a.
The reactant and the product are the same in a
circular pathway but different in a linear
pathway.
b.
The circular pathway components get exhausted
whereas those of the linear pathway do not and
are continually regenerated.
c.
Circular pathways are not suited for amphibolic
pathways whereas linear pathways are.
d.
Circular pathways contain a single chemical
reaction that is repeated while linear pathways
have multiple events.
31. Cellular respiration breaks down glucose and releases
carbon dioxide and water. Which steps in the oxidation of
pyruvate produces carbon dioxide?
a.
Removal of a carboxyl group from pyruvate
releases carbon dioxide. The pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex comes into play.
b.
Removal of an acetyl group from pyruvate
releases carbon dioxide. The pyruvate
decarbox
