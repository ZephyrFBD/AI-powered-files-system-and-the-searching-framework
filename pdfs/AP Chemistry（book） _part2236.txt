thyl isonitrile to acetonitrile, for example, we might imagine the reac-
tion passing through an intermediate state in which the N ‚C portion of the methyl 
isonitrile molecule is sideways:

Which of the following determines how hard the golfer must strike the ball: 
the difference in elevation between the ball and the hole or between the 
ball and the top of the barrier?

Figure 14.16 shows that energy must be supplied to stretch the bond 
between the H3C group and the N ‚C group to allow the N ‚C 
group to rotate. After the N ‚C group has twisted sufficiently, 
the C ¬C bond begins to form, and the energy of the molecule 
drops. Thus, the barrier to formation of acetonitrile represents 
the energy necessary to force the molecule through the rela-
tively unstable intermediate state, analogous to forcing the ball in
