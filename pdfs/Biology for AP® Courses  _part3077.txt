Synaptic Plasticity
Synapses are not static structures. They can be weakened or strengthened. They can be broken, and new synapses can be
made. Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. In fact, synaptic
plasticity is the basis of learning and memory. Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that
is involved in storing memories.
Long-term Potentiation (LTP)
Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. LTP is based on the Hebbian
principle: cells that fire together wire together. There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic
strengthening seen with LTP. One known mechanism involves a t
