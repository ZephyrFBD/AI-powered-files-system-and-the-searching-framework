16.17 Effect of cations on solution pH. The pH values of 1.0 M solutions of four nitrate 
salts are estimated using acid–base indicators.

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
 2. If the salt contains an anion that reacts with water to produce hydroxide ions and a 
cation that does not react with water, we expect the pH to be basic. Such is the case 
when the anion is the conjugate base of a weak acid and the cation is either from 
group 1A or one of the heavier members of group 2A 1Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+2. Exam-
ples: NaClO, RbF, BaSO3.
 3. If the salt contains a cation that reacts with water to produce hydronium ions and an 
anion that does not react with water, we expect the pH to be acidic. Such is the case 
when the cation is a conjugate acid of a weak base or a small cation with a charge of 
2+ or greater. Examples: NH4NO3, AlCl3, Fe1NO323.
 4. If the salt contains an anion and a cation both capable of reacting with water, both 
hydroxide ions and hydronium ions are produced. Whethe
