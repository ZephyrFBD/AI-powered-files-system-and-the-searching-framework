These questions are designed to help you understand concepts related to transpiration in 
plants before you design and conduct your investigation(s). 
1. If a plant cell has a lower water potential than its surrounding environment, make a 
prediction about the movement of water across the cell membrane. In other words, 
will the cell gain water or lose water? Explain your answer in the form of a diagram 
with annotations.

2. In the winter, salt is sometimes spread over icy roads. In the spring, after the ice has 
melted, grass often dies near these roads. What causes this to happen? Explain your 
answer in the form of a diagram with annotations. 
3. Prepare a thin section of stem from your plant and examine it under the microscope 
to identify the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) and the structural differences 
in their cells. Describe how the observed differences in cellular structure reflect
