o she expired, giving praise. 
 
 Virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not 
 
 minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled 
 
 them on the spot. 
 
 How is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven 
 
 thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her 
 
 to marry a pagan king but she said, I’ll go away for awhile, three years, 
 
 and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladiesin- 
 
 waiting and their companions, ten thousand.They sailed around for 
 
  
  
 awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in 
 
 Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, 
 
 she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her.Why 
 
 couldn’t she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why 
 
 did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn? 
 
 I like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn’t live in a palace like the 
 
 bishop of Limerick. H
