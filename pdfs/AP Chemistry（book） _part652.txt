s added to a solution of cobalt(II) sulfate.
 4.56 Using the activity series (Table 4.5), write balanced chemical 
equations for the following reactions. If no reaction occurs, 
write NR. (a) Nickel metal is added to a solution of copper(II) 
nitrate, (b) a solution of zinc nitrate is added to a solution 
of magnesium sulfate, (c) hydrochloric acid is added to 
gold metal, (d) chromium metal is immersed in an aqueous 
solution of cobalt(II) chloride, (e) hydrogen gas is bubbled 
through a solution of silver nitrate.
 4.57 The metal cadmium tends to form Cd2+ ions. The following 
observations are made: (i) When a strip of zinc metal is placed 
in CdCl21aq), cadmium metal is deposited on the strip. (ii) 
When a strip of cadmium metal is placed in Ni1NO3221aq), 
nickel metal is deposited on the strip. (a) Write net ionic 
equations to explain each of the preceding observations. 
(b) Which elements more closely define the position of cad-
mium in the activity series? (c) What experiments w
