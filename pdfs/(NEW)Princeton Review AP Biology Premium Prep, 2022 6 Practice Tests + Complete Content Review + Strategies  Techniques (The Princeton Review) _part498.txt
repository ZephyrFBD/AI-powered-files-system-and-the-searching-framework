omehow enhanced on the same amount of enzyme that was present without
Protein Y. Protein Y might be an enzyme activator of Enzyme B. It might bind to Enzyme B directly or maybe the protein
phosphorylates it or cleaves it to make the enzyme active.
d) It looks like Enzyme C is unaffected by Protein Y at the mRNA and protein levels, but it looks like the enzyme
activity is turned off. With an inhibitor of Protein Y the enzyme level would likely return to the untreated level of around
18,000. The mRNA and the protein would not change with the inhibitor of Protein Y.
