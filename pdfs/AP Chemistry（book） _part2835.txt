group 2 and those precipitated in group 3? (c) Suggest a 
procedure that would serve to redissolve the group 3 cat-
ions following their precipitation.
 17.82  A student who is in a great hurry to finish his laboratory 
work decides that his qualitative analysis unknown contains 
a metal ion from group 4 of Figure 17.23. He therefore tests 
his sample directly with 1NH422HPO4, skipping earlier tests 
for the metal ions in groups 1, 2, and 3. He observes a precip-
itate and concludes that a metal ion from group 4 is indeed 
present. Why is this possibly an erroneous conclusion?

 [17.84] Rainwater is acidic because CO21g2 dissolves in the water, 
creating carbonic acid, H2CO3. If the rainwater is too acidic, 
it will react with limestone and seashells (which are prin-
cipally made of calcium carbonate, CaCO3). Calculate the
