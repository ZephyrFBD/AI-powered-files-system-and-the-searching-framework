on numbers and for-
mal charges on all the atoms: (a) SO2, (b) SO3, (c) SO3
2 -.  
(d) Arrange these molecules/ions in order of increasing 
S ¬O bond length.
 8.53 (a) Draw the best Lewis structure(s) for the nitrite ion, NO2
-. 
(b) With what allotrope of oxygen is it isoelectronic? 
 
(c) What would you predict for the lengths of the bonds 
in NO2
- relative to N ¬O single bonds and double 
bonds?
 8.54 Consider the formate ion, HCO2
-, which is the anion 
formed when formic acid loses an H+ ion. The H and the two 
O atoms are bonded to the central C atom. (a) Draw the best 
Lewis structure(s) for this ion. (b) Are resonance structures 
needed to describe the structure? (c) Would you predict that 
the C ¬O bond lengths in the formate ion would be longer 
or shorter relative to those in CO2?
 8.55 Predict the ordering, from shortest to longest, of the bond 
lengths in CO, CO2, and CO3
2 -.
 8.56 Based on Lewis structures, predict the ordering, from short-
est to longest, of N ¬O bond
