Sometimes a living organismâ€™s survival depends on some cells dying and not reproducing. This programmed cell
death is called apoptosis. Apoptosis may be triggered when a cell acquires a mutation that could cause cancer.
During embryonic development, apoptosis may also occur to ensure proper development of various organs or
structures. For example, during early embryonic development, the digits of the hand are initially attached with a
weblike structure. During the sixth to eighth weeks of embryonic development, apoptosis eliminates the webbing
between the digits of the hand, resulting in the formation of separated fingers.
