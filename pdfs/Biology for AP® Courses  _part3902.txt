. Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are
molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment. A monocyte is a type
of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected
tissue. Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host
molecules). TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components
of the immune system. TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system.
