“virus isolation.” This brew
containing fragments of genetic material from many sources is then
subjected to genetic analysis, which then creates in a computer-
simulation process the alleged sequence of the alleged virus, a so
called in silico genome. At no time is an actual virus conﬁrmed by
electron microscopy. At no time is a genome extracted and
sequenced from an actual virus. This is scientiﬁc fraud.
The observation that the unpuriﬁed specimen — inoculated onto
tissue culture along with toxic antibiotics, bovine fetal tissue,
amniotic ﬂuid and other tissues — destroys the kidney tissue onto
which it is inoculated is given as evidence of the virus’ existence and
pathogenicity. This is scientiﬁc fraud.
From now on, when anyone gives you a paper that suggests the
SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated, please check the methods
sections. If the researchers used Vero cells or any other culture
method, you know that their process was not isolation. You will hear
the following excuses for w
