45. What is the evolutionary significance of glycogen
production?
a.
Excess ATP and glucose produce glycogen,
which can be used at a later point in time to act
as co-factor if, for example, a good source is
scarce.
b.
Excess proteins and glucose produce glycogen,
which can be used at a later point in time to
produce energy if, for example, food is scarce.
c.
Excess ATP and glucose produce glycogen,
which can be used at a later point in time to
produce energy if, for example, food is scarce.
d.
Excess proteins and fats produce glycogen,
which can be used at a later point in time to act
as source of nitrogen if, for example, a good
source is scarce.
