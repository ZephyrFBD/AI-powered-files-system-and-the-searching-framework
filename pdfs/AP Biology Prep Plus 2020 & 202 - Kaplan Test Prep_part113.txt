nment. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because life requires
self-replicating molecules (such as DNA or RNA), but monomers like
nucleotides and amino acids are too simple to replicate themselves.
(C) is incorrect because the early Earth is actually believed to have had
higher temperatures than are experienced today, so the first cells had
to function in a hot environment. (D) is incorrect because biologists
widely agree that life originated on Earth only once, so that all living
organisms share a common ancestor.

In order for adaptation to a particular environmental circumstance to
occur, genetic variation in a relevant trait must exist or arise through
mutation. Because the increased carbon dioxide levels make their
environment more acidic, the cod should possess variability in their
ability to survive in acidic conditions, so that genes promoting greater
survival in an acidic environment can be selected for. (A) is thus
correct. (B) is incorrect bec
