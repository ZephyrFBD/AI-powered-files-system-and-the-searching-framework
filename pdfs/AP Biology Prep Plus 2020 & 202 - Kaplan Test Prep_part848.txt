 so a
reduction in rinderpest should lead to an increase in the wildebeest
population. Because the wildebeest are grazers, an increase in their
population should lead to a decrease in the amount of grass, which in
turn will make it harder for fires to spread. (C) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because more wildebeests will result in less grass, not more
grass. (B) and (D) are incorrect because the wildebeest population
should increase when rinderpest prevalence decreases.

Plants obtain energy from the Sun, so the role of fertilizer is not to
provide energy but to provide other nutrients that the plant needs,
such as nitrogen, which is used to build proteins and other organic
molecules. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because plants do not
derive energy directly from the fertilizer and because the nitrogen is
not consumed, but is recycled through the nitrogen cycle. (C) is
incorrect because plants do not take up energy directly from the
fertilizer.
