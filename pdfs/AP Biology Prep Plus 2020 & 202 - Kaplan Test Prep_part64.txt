a river in Southwestern Spain whose
waters flow with a red tint due to a high concentration of iron. The river is
also known for its extremely low pH and its high concentrations of heavy
metals such as copper, gold, and silver. Though the waters have been
deemed too dangerous for humans to swim in, there are a variety of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities that have made the river their
home.
While scientists initially believed that the large concentration of copper
and mining operations were the cause of the low pH, new information led
to the discovery that the decrease in pH was actually due to the oxidation
of sulfur by chemolithotrophic organisms, which are a group of
organisms characterized by their ability to oxidize inorganic compounds
to obtain energy. The remaining organisms that inhabit this extreme
ecosystem fall into the following three groups: photosynthetic primary
producers, consumers, and decomposers. Further investigation led them
