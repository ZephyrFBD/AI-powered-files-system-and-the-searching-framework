to bind processed antigens via MHC molecules on APCs.
Helper T Lymphocytes
The TH lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system. These cells
are important for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa. TH lymphocytes
recognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs. There are two major populations of TH cells:
TH1 and TH2. TH1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. TH1 cells activate the
action of cyotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages. TH2 cells stimulate na√Øve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody
secretion. Whether a TH1 or a TH2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells
of the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.
The TH1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation. Recall
