e from the surface (Section 13–12). Hence the average speed of the
remaining molecules is less, so by Eq. 13–8 the temperature is less.

CHAPTER 14
Heat
Evaporation of water from skin is one of the most important ways the body
uses to control its temperature. When the temperature of the blood rises slightly
above normal, the hypothalamus region of the brain detects this temperature increase
and sends a signal to the sweat glands to increase their production. The energy (latent
heat) needed to vaporize this water comes from the body, so the body cools.
Kinetic Theory of Latent Heats
We can make use of kinetic theory to see why energy is needed to melt or vaporize
a substance. At the melting point, the latent heat of fusion does not act to increase
the average kinetic energy (and the temperature) of the molecules in the solid, but
instead is used to overcome the potential energy associated with the forces between
the molecules. That is, work must be done against these attractive force
