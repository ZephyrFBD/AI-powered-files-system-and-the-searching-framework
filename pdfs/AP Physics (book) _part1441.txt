ith temperature, so the whole distribution curve shifts to
the right at higher temperatures. Kinetic theory can be applied approximately to
liquids and solutions. Figure 13–20 illustrates how kinetic theory can explain why
many chemical reactions, including those in biological cells, take place more
rapidly as the temperature increases. Most chemical reactions occur in a liquid
solution, and the molecules have a speed distribution close to the Maxwell distri-
bution. Two molecules may chemically react only if their kinetic energy is above
some particular minimum value (called the activation energy),
so that when
they collide, they penetrate into each other somewhat. Figure 13–20 shows that
at a higher temperature, many more molecules have a speed and kinetic energy
KE above the needed threshold EA.
