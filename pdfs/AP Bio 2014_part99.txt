ed bar graph to analyze the effect of pH on 
polyphenol oxidase activity. 
(b) Based on the experimental results, estimate the optimal pH of the enzyme. Explain your estimate by 
connecting the experimental results to the structure and function of proteins. 
(c) Propose an appropriate control treatment for the experiment, and describe how the control treatment would 
increase the validity of the results. 
(d) Genetic engineering can be used to disrupt specific genes in the genome of an organism. Predict how the 
browning of apple slices would be affected in a strain of apples that was genetically engineered to lack 
functional copies of the gene encoding polyphenol oxidase. Justify your response.
