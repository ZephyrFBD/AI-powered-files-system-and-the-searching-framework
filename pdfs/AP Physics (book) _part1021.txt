lasma phase, which occurs only at very high temperatures and consists
of ionized atoms (electrons separated from the nuclei). Some scientists believe that
colloids (suspensions of tiny particles in a liquid) should also be considered a separate
phase of matter. Liquid crystals, used in TV, cell phone, and computer screens,
can be considered a phase of matter in between solids and liquids. For now, we
will be interested in the three ordinary phases of matter.
10–2 Density and Specific Gravity
It is sometimes said that iron is “heavier” than wood. This cannot really be true
since a large log clearly weighs more than an iron nail. What we should say is that
iron is more dense than wood.
The density,
of a substance ( is the lowercase Greek letter rho) is defined
as its mass per unit volume:
(10;1)
where m is the mass of a sample of the substance and V its volume. Density is a char-
acteristic property of any pure substance. Objects made of a particular pure substance,
such as pure gold, ca
