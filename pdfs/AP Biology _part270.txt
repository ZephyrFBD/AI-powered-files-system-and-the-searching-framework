his wide variation in genotypes always results in a bell-
shaped curve in an entire population. See Figure 8.5, which shows the
distribution of skin pigmentation across a population.

Figure 8.5 Polygenic Inheritance
MORE EXCEPTIONS TO MENDELIAN INHERITANCE
Two other inheritance patterns are exceptions to Mendelian inheritance:
genomic imprinting and extranuclear genes. Genomic imprinting is a
variation in phenotype depending on whether a trait is inherited from the
mother or from the father. It occurs during gamete formation and is caused
by the silencing of a particular allele by methylation of DNA. Therefore, a
zygote expresses only one allele of the imprinted gene. The imprint is
carried to all body cells and passed down from generation to generation.
Unlike sex-linked genes, which are located on the X chromosome,
imprinted genes are located on autosomes.
Extranuclear genes are genes located in mitochondria and
chloroplasts. The DNA in th
