d far toward F. The resulting bond is therefore most accurately described as 
ionic. Thus, if we considered the bond in LiF to be fully ionic, we could say d+ for Li is 1+ 
and d- for F is 1-. If two atoms differ in electronegativity by more than 2.0, many chem-
ists would consider their bond to be an ionic bond.
The shift of electron density toward the more electronegative atom in a bond 
can be seen from the results of calculations of electron-density distributions. For the 
three species in our example, the calculated electron-density distributions are shown
