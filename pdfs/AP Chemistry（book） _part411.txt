Simple Patterns of Chemical Reactivity

In a decomposition reaction one substance undergoes a reaction to produce two 
or more other substances (Table 3.1). For example, many metal carbonates decompose to 
form metal oxides and carbon dioxide when heated:
 
CaCO31s2 ¡
∆
CaO1s2 + CO21g2 
 [3.7] 
Decomposition of CaCO3 is an important commercial process. Limestone or seashells, 
which are both primarily CaCO3, are heated to prepare CaO, known as lime or quicklime. 
Tens of millions of tons of CaO are used in the United States each year in making glass, in 
metallurgy where it is used to isolate the metals from their ores, and in steel manufactur-
ing where it is used to remove impurities.
The decomposition of sodium azide 1NaN32 rapidly releases N21g2, so this reaction is 
used to inflate safety air bags in automobiles (Figure
