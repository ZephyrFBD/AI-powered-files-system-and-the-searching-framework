l be T–A–G.
The two DNA strands run in opposite directions. You’ll notice from the figure above that each DNA strand has a 5′
end and a 3′ end, so-called for the carbon that ends the strand (i.e., the fifth carbon in the sugar ring is at the 5′ end,
while the third carbon is at the 3′ end). The 5′ end has a phosphate group, and the 3′ end has an OH, or “hydroxyl,”
group. The 5′ end of one strand is always opposite to the 3′ end of the other strand. The strands are therefore said to
be antiparallel.
The DNA strands are linked by hydrogen bonds. Two hydrogen bonds hold adenine and thymine together, and
three hydrogen bonds hold cytosine and guanine together.
Before we go any further, let’s review the base pairing in DNA:
Adenine pairs up with thymine (A–T or T–A) by forming two hydrogen bonds.
Cytosine pairs up with guanine (G–C or C–G) by forming three hydrogen bonds.
GENOME STRUCTURE
The order of the four base pairs in a DNA strand is the genetic code. Like a special alphabet in our ce
