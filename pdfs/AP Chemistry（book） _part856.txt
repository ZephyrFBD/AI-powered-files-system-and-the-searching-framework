00 kJ>mol, and that gasoline has an average 
density of 0.70 g>mL. The density of ethanol is 0.79 g>mL. (a) 
By using the information given as well as data in Appendix C, 
compare the energy produced by combustion of 1.0 L of gaso-
line and of 1.0 L of ethanol. (b) Assume that the density and 
heat of combustion of E85 can be obtained by using 85% of 
the values for ethanol and 15% of the values for gasoline. How 
much energy could be released by the combustion of 1.0 L of 
E85? (c) How many gallons of E85 would be needed to provide 
the same energy as 10 gal of gasoline? (d) If gasoline costs $3.88 
per gallon in the United States, what is the break-even price per 
gallon of E85 if the same amount of energy is to be delivered?
