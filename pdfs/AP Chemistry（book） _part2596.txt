familiar weak acids, such as acetic acid 1Ka = 1.8 * 10-52. In contrast, the ions of alkali 
and alkaline earth metals, being relatively large and not highly charged, do not react 
with water and therefore do not affect pH. Note that these are the same cations found in 
the strong bases (Section 16.5). The different tendencies of four cations to lower the pH 
of a solution are illustrated in Figure 16.17. 
The mechanism by which metal ions produce acidic solutions is shown in Fig-
ure 16.18. Because metal ions are positively charged, they attract the unshared elec-
tron pairs of water molecules and become hydrated. 
 (Section 13.1) The larger the 
charge on the metal ion, the stronger the interaction between the ion and the oxy-
gen of its hydrating water molecules. As the strength of this interaction increases, the 
O Â¬H bonds in the hydrating water molecules become weaker. This facilitates transfer 
of protons from the hydration water molecules to solvent water molecules.
