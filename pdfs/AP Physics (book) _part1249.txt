is the ocean at this point?
43. (II) Two children are sending signals along a cord of total
mass 0.50 kg tied between tin cans with a tension of 35 N.
It takes the vibrations in the string 0.55 s to go from one
child to the other. How far apart are the children?

44. (II) What is the ratio of (a) the intensities, and (b) the
amplitudes, of an earthquake P wave passing through the
Earth and detected at two points 15 km and 45 km from
the source?
45. (II) The intensity of an earthquake wave passing through
the Earth is measured to be 
at a distance
of 54 km from the source. (a) What was its intensity when
it passed a point only 1.0 km from the source? (b) At what
rate did energy pass through an area of 
at 1.0 km?
46. (II) A bug on the surface of a pond is observed to move 
up and down a total vertical distance of 7.0 cm, from the
lowest to the highest point, as a wave passes. If the ripples
decrease to 4.5 cm,
