ons of photosynthesis occur on infoldings of the plasma membrane and the light-independent reactions occur
in the cytosol.
Light-Dependent Reactions
In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is used to drive the production of ATP. This is called
photophosphorylation. Light energy excites the electrons in the chloroplast to higher energy levels. As these
excited electrons move through the chloroplast, energy is released. At the end of the light-dependent reactions,
NADP+ accepts these electrons, forming NADPH, which is a source of reducing power for the light-independent
reactions.
TIP
As you review the light-dependent reactions, focus on the role of light energy and the path of the excited electrons during the process.
Chlorophyll is a light-absorbing pigment that captures the energy of photons from the sun. Chlorophylls are the
primary light-absorbing pigments in photosynthesis. Chlorophylls are found in photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII).
A photosystem is composed of proteins,
