Figure 1. Simple Cladogram Representing Different Plant Species 
Note that the cladogram is treelike, with the endpoints of each branch representing a 
specific species. The closer two species are located to each other, the more recently they 
share a common ancestor. For example, Selaginella (spikemoss) and Isoetes (quillwort) 
share a more recent common ancestor than the common ancestor that is shared by all 
three species of moss. 
Figure 2 includes additional details, such as the evolution of particular physical 
structures called shared derived characters. Note that the placement of the derived 
characters corresponds to when that character evolved; every species above the character 
label possesses that structure. For example, tigers and gorillas have hair, but lampreys, 
sharks, salamanders, and lizards do not have hair.
