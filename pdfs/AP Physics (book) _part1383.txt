motion, named after the biologist Robert Brown, who is credited with its discov-
ery in 1827. While he was observing tiny pollen grains suspended in water under
his microscope, Brown noticed that the tiny grains moved about in erratic paths
(Fig. 13–1), even though the water appeared to be perfectly still. The atomic
theory easily explains Brownian motion if we assume that the atoms of any 
substance are continually in motion. Then Brown’s tiny pollen grains are jostled
about by the vigorous barrage of rapidly moving molecules of water.
In 1905, Albert Einstein examined Brownian motion from a theoretical point
of view and was able to calculate from the experimental data the approximate
size and mass of atoms and molecules. His calculations showed that the diameter
of a typical atom is about 
At the start of Chapter 10, we distinguished the three common phases (or
states) of matter—solid, liquid, gas—based on macroscopic, or “large-scale,” prop-
erties. Now let us see how these t
