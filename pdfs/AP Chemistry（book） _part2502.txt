ct the forward reaction to be endothermic or exo-
thermic?  (d) If the temperature is raised to 1000 K, will 
the reverse rate constant kr increase or decrease?  Will the 
change in kr be larger or smaller than the change in kf ?
 15.100 In Section 1
1.5, we defined the vapor pressure of a liquid in 
terms of an equilibrium. (a) Write the equation represent-
ing the equilibrium between liquid water and water vapor 
and the corresponding expression for Kp. (b) By using data 
in Appendix B, give the value of Kp for this reaction at 30 °C. 
(c) What is the value of Kp for any liquid in equilibrium with 
its vapor at the normal boiling point of the liquid?
 15.101 Water molecules in the atmosphere can form hydrogen- 
bonded dimers, 1H2O22. The presence of these dimers 
is thought to be important in the nucleation of ice crys-
tals in the atmosphere and in the formation of acid rain. 
 
(a) Using VSEPR theory, draw the structure of a water 
dimer, using dashed lines to indicate intermolecul
