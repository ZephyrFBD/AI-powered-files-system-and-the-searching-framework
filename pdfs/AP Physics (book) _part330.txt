4–2 Newton’s First Law of Motion
What is the relationship between force and motion? Aristotle (384–322 B.C.)
believed that a force was required to keep an object moving along a horizontal
plane. To Aristotle, the natural state of an object was at rest, and a force was
believed necessary to keep an object in motion. Furthermore, Aristotle argued,
the greater the force on the object, the greater its speed.
Some 2000 years later, Galileo disagreed: he maintained that it is just as natural
for an object to be in motion with a constant velocity as it is for it to be at rest.
To understand Galileo’s idea, consider the following observations involving
motion along a horizontal plane. To push an object with a rough surface along a
tabletop at constant speed requires a certain amount of force. To push an equally
heavy object with a very smooth surface across the table at the same speed will
require less force. If a layer of oil or other lubricant is placed between the surface
