 the skills 
learned in Unit 2—and calculate reaction 
rates. Students are advised to show their 
calculations, ensuring that units are included 
in their final answer.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 3, students build on knowledge gained in Unit 2 about the structure and function of 
cells, focusing on cellular energetics. Living systems are complex in their organization and 
require constant energy input. This unit will provide students with the knowledge necessary to 
master the concepts of energy capture and use. Students work through enzyme structure and 
function, learning the ways in which the environment plays a role in how enzymes perform their 
function(s). Students gain a deeper understanding of the processes of photosynthesis and 
cellular respiration, knowledge they will use in Unit 6 while studying how cells use energy to fuel 
life processes.
