(d) The enzymes of the Krebs cycle function in the cytosol of bacteria, but among eukaryotes the enzymes 
function mostly in the mitochondria. Pose a scientific question that connects the subcellular location 
of the enzymes in the Krebs cycle to the evolution of eukaryotes. 
 
Question (1 point) 
• 
A valid scientific question related to evolution of eukaryotes (e.g., Since the Krebs cycle occurs 
in the “cytoplasm” of the mitochondria (matrix), does it suggest that mitochondria were once 
prokaryotes?)

Question 3 
 
The amino-acid sequence of cytochrome c was determined for five different species of vertebrates. The  
table below shows the number of differences in the sequences between each pair of species.
