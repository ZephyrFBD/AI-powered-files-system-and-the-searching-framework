treatment disks into a solution of bicarbonate and
control disks into a solution without bicarbonate.
5. Expose both beakers to a light source and begin timing.
6. As photosynthesis progresses, oxygen will accumulate in the spongy mesophyll, increasing the buoyancy of the
leaf disks. Record the time it takes each disk to reach the surface.
7. Summarize the data by calculating the median, the value at which half of the data is above and below. The median
is a better statistic than the mean for this data because it reduces the impact of outliers. To obtain a rate for
photosynthetic activity, calculate the time it takes for 50% of the
disks to reach the surface
 
. This value, called the effective
 
time (ET50), has been shown to be a reliable number for photosynthetic rate for comparison across treatments.
Part II: Investigating Factors That Affect the Rate of Photosynthesis
Light intensity, light wavelength, temperature, and concentration of bicarbonate are environmental factors that af
