l wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between
the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place,
the daughter cells separate.

The precise timing and formation of the mitotic spindle is critical to the success of eukaryotic cell division.
Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, do not undergo karyokinesis and therefore have no need for a mitotic
spindle. However, the FtsZ protein that plays such a vital role in prokaryotic cytokinesis is structurally
and functionally very similar to tubulin, the building block of the microtubules that make up the mitotic
spindle fibers that are necessary for eukaryotes. FtsZ proteins can form filaments, rings, and other three-
dimensional structures that resemble the way tubulin forms microtubules, cen
