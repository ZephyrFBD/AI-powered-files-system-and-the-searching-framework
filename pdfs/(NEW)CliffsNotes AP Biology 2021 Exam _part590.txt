n heads and forms ADP + Pi. When a
neuron stimulates a muscle, the action potential travels throughout the T-tubule invaginations,
 
stimulating sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+. The Ca2+ causes
 
the tropomyosin to expose the binding sites on the actin. Once this occurs, cross bridges form between myosin and
actin, ADP and Pi are
released from the myosin heads, and the cross bridges cause the actin to move toward the center of the sarcomere,
pulling the Z-lines together and causing the myofibril to shorten.

1. HIV is different from most other viruses because it attacks white blood cells (specifically, helper T cells). When
helper T cells become infected, the cell-mediated response stimulates the production of additional helper T cells,
killer T cells, and B cells. As helper T cells increase in number, however, more and more of them become infected
by the HIV Eventually, most T cells are destroyed, allowing the proli
