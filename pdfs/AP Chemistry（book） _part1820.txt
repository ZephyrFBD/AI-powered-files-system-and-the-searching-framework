  Suppose you have two colorless molecular liquids, one boil-
ing at -84 째C, the other at 34 째C, and both at atmospheric 
pressure. Which of the following statements is correct? For 
each statement that is not correct, modify the statement so 
that it is correct. (a) The higher-boiling liquid has greater 
total intermolecular forces than the lower-boiling liquid. (b) 
The lower-boiling liquid must consist of nonpolar molecules. 
 
(c) The lower-boiling liquid has a lower molecular weight 
than the higher-boiling liquid. (d) The two liquids have iden-
tical vapor pressures at their normal boiling points. (e) At 
-84 째C both liquids have vapor pressures of 760 mm Hg.
