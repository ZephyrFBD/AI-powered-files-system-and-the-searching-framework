temperature 
one. Nevertheless, the Haber process is carried out at high 
temperatures because the reaction is extremely slow at room 
temperature.
Remember Thermodynamics can tell us the direction and 
extent of a reaction but tells us nothing about the rate at 
which it will occur. If a catalyst were found that would permit 
the reaction to proceed at a rapid rate at room temperature, 
high pressures would not be needed to force the equilibrium 
toward NH3.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The Ksp for a very insoluble salt is 4.2 * 10-47 at 298 K. What 
is ∆G° for the dissolution of the salt in water?
(a) -265 kJ>mol (b) -115 kJ>mol (c) -2.61 kJ>mol
(d) +115 kJ>mol (e) +265 kJ>mol
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use data from Appendix C to calculate ∆G° and K at 298 K for 
the reaction H21g2 + Br21l2 ∆2 HBr1g2.
Many desirable chemical reactions, including a large number that 
are central to living systems, are nonspontaneous as written. For 
example, consider the extraction of copper metal from the min
