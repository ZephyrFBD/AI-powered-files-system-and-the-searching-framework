n use a form of Equation 20.8 that describes 
redox reactions in general, not just reactions in voltaic cells:
 
E ° = E °
red 1reduction process2 - E °
red 1oxidation process2 
[20.10]
In writing the equation this way, we have dropped the subscript “cell” to indicate that 
the calculated emf does not necessarily refer to a voltaic cell. Also, we have generalized 
the standard reduction potentials by using the general terms reduction and oxidation 
rather than the terms specific to voltaic cells, cathode and anode. We can now make a gen-
eral statement about the spontaneity of a reaction and its associated emf, E: A positive 
value of E indicates a spontaneous process; a negative value of E indicates a nonspontaneous 
process. We use E to represent the emf under nonstandard conditions and E° to indicate 
the standard emf.
Use Table 20.1 to determine whether the following reactions are spontaneous under standard conditions.
(a) Cu1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ Cu2+1aq2 + H21g2
(b) Cl21g2 + 2 I-1aq2 ¡
