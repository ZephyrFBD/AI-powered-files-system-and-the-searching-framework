s change quickly if two viruses infect the same cell. The gene segments of each virus can
recombine and mix with each other and package into mixed viruses that are a chimera of the original two viruses.
This can increase genetic variation among viruses.
BIOTECHNOLOGY
Recombinant DNA
Scientists have learned how to harness the Central Dogma in order to research and cure diseases. Recombinant
DNA is generated by combining DNA from multiple sources to create a unique DNA molecule that is not found in
nature. A common application of recombinant DNA technology is the introduction of a eukaryotic gene of interest
(such as insulin) into a bacterium for production. In other words, bacteria can be hijacked and put to work as little
protein factories. This branch of technology that produces new organisms or products by transferring genes between
cells is called genetic engineering.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used to create bil
