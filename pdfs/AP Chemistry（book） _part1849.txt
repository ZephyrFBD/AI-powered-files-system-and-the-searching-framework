fic motif of atoms, and the crystal structure is built up by repeating 
the unit cell over and over. This process is illustrated in Figure 12.8 for a two-dimensional 
crystal based on a hexagonal unit cell and a two-carbon-atom motif. The resulting 
infinite two-dimensional honeycomb structure is a two-dimensional crystal called 
graphene, a material that has so many interesting properties that its modern discoverers 
won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three 
neighboring carbon atoms in what amounts to an infinite sheet of interconnected hex-
agonal rings.
The crystal structure of graphene illustrates two important characteristics of crys-
tals. First, we see that no atoms lie on the lattice points. While most of the structures we 
discuss in this chapter do have atoms on the lattice points, there are many examples, like 
graphene, where this is not the case. Thus, to build up a structure you must know the 
location and orientation of the a
