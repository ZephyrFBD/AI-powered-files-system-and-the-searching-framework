identify a number of genes that encode membrane proteins
with distinct extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic
domains.
Which of the following results would best support the hypothesis
that these genes are evolutionarily related to RTKs?
The sequences encoding the extracellular ligand-binding
domains of the protists are similar to the gene sequences for
the extracellular region of human RTKs.
(A)
The sequences encoding the membrane-spanning domains
of the protists are similar to the gene sequences for the
membrane-spanning region of human RTKs.
(B)
The sequences encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the
protists are similar to the gene sequences for the tyrosine
kinase regions of human RTKs.
(C)
The entire gene sequences for the proteins of the protists are
similar to the gene sequences for the entire coding region of
human RTKs.
(D)
4. The hormone insulin is produced by the Î² cells of the pancreas.
When the levels of glucose rise above a set threshold, insulin is
released in th
