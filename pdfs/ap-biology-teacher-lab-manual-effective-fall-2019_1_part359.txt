tions or concepts that they had 
difficulty understanding about the process of photosynthesis before conducting their 
investigations. 
3. Did students have sufficient mathematical skills to calculate the rate(s) of  
photosynthesis?  
4. Released AP Exams have several multiple-choice and essay questions based on the 
concepts studied in this investigation. These could be used to assess your students’ 
understanding.
