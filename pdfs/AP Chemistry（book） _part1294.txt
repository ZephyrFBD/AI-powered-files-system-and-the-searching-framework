arbon benzene, 
C6H6. The six C atoms are bonded in a hexagonal ring, and one H atom is bonded to each 
C atom. We can write two equivalent dominant Lewis structures for benzene, each of 
which satisfies the octet rule. These two structures are in resonance:

Note that the double bonds are in different places in the two structures. Each of these 
resonance structures shows three carbon–carbon single bonds and three carbon–carbon 
double bonds. However, experimental data show that all six C ¬C bonds are of equal 
length, 1.40 Å, intermediate between the typical bond lengths for a C ¬C single bond 
(1.54 Å) and a C “C double bond (1.34 Å). Each of the C ¬C bonds in benzene can be 
thought of as a blend of a single bond and a double bond (Figure 8.15).
Benzene is commonly represented by omitting the hydrogen atoms and showing only 
the carbon–carbon framework with the vertices unlabeled. In this convention, the reso-
nance in the molecule is
