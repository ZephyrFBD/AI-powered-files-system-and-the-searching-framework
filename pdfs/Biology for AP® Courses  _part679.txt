e diagram will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the
products. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the
reactants, and thus, EA is always positive.

Watch an animation of the move from free energy to transition state at this (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/

Explain why transitional states are unstable.
a.
Molecules have relaxed molecular structure with low energy.
b.
Molecules have strained molecular structure with high energy.
c.
Molecules have relaxed molecular structure with high energy.
d.
Molecules have strained molecular structure with low energy.
Where does the activation energy required by chemical reactants come from? The source of the activation energy needed
to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings. Heat energy (the total bond energy of reactants
or products in a chemical reaction) speeds up
