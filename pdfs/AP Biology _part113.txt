They consist of actin fibers.
They assist in the formation of the cleavage furrow in animal
cells during cell division.
Dr. Lynn Margulis developed the theory of endosymbiosis. This

Refer to the diagram below.
Which of the following choices describes which cell, A or B, would
be most efficient in terms of transporting nutrients and waste across
the plasma membrane and provides the correct reasoning for that
answer?
Cell A, because the ratio of the membrane surface area to the
volume of the cytoplasm is much greater in the smaller cell
Cell A, because the ratio of the membrane surface area to the
volume of the cytoplasm is much smaller in the smaller cell
Cell B, because the larger the cell, the greater the rate of
diffusion
