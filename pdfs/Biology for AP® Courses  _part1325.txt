bbit coat color (C) gene.
The complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of “dosage” of a specific
gene product, such that the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the mutant alleles cannot.
For the allelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply
a lesser dosage or none at all. Interestingly, the Himalayan phenotype is the result of an allele that produces a temperature-
sensitive gene product that only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbit’s body.
Alternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes, including the wild type. This may occur when
the mutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one wild-type allele copy
expresses the mutant phenotype. One way in which the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wild-
type gene pr
