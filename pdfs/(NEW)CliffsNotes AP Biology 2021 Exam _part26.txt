 necessary. But don’t expect all grid-in questions to require the use of a calculator.
Some do not.
2. Enter appropriate negative signs and operators. If your answer has a negative value, be sure to enter a
negative sign. If the question requires that an answer be expressed as a fraction, be sure to enter the division operator
(“/” as in “¼”).

level of accuracy. For example, answers may require that you calculate your answer to the nearest whole number, to
the nearest tenth, or to the nearest hundredth. Because of rounding, some questions allow a range of correct answers.
Depending on the type of question, a correct answer can vary by 1% to 5%, sometimes even more. In other cases,
where rounding does not occur, only a single value is accepted. If the question asks for an answer expressed to the
nearest whole number, that is usually a clue that the answer has only one accepted
