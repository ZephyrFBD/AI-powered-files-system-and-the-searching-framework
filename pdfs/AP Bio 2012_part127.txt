Learning Objective 
4.23: The student is able to construct explanations of the 
influence of environmental factors on the phenotype of  
an organism.
(A)
This option is correct. It demonstrates the ability to explain the influence of 
environmental factors on the phenotype of an organism. When the genes of 
the arctic fox that produce the dark coat are blocked by cold temperatures, a 
white coat results. In the summer these genes are not blocked, and a darker 
coat results.
(B)
This option is incorrect. The diet of the foxes in the summer or winter, regardless 
of whether it lacks a particular nutrient, would not cause a coat color change. In 
addition, the diet of the foxes in the summer is more likely to be better in terms of 
nutrients than in the winter.
(C)
This option is incorrect. Competition for mates and the increase in camouflage in 
the spring are not responsible for the seasonal change in coat color. Competition 
for mates generally
