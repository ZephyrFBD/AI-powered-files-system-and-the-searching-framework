Water Potential:
P s i  
=
 Psi_p + Psi_s
P s i = pressure potential
Ps i = solute potential

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-2.I
Explain how osmoregulatory 
mechanisms contribute 
to the health and survival 
of organisms.
ENE-2.I.2
Osmoregulation maintains water balance and 
allows organisms to control their internal solute 
composition/water potential.
