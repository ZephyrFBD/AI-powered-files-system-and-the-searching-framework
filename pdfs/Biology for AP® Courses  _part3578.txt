he body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a
waste product will diffuse from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli
emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many
alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a
sponge-like consistency. This organization produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface
area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m2. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the
alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.
Figure 30.10 Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Each
alveolar sac contains 20 to 30 spherical alveoli and has the appearance of a bunch of grapes. Air flows into the
