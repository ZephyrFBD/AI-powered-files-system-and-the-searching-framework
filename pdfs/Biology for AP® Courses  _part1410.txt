44. Construct a representation showing the connection
between the process of meiosis and the transmission of six
possible phenotypes from parents to F2 offspring. The
phenotypes are labeled A, a, B, b and C, c. Expression of
each phenotype is controlled by a separate Mendelian
gene. Your representation should show the proportion of
every possible combination of phenotypes (e.g., ABC,
AbC, etc.) that will be present in the F2 offspring.

Figure 13.1 Chromosomes are threadlike nuclear structures consisting of DNA and proteins that serve as the
repositories for genetic information. The chromosomes depicted here were isolated from a fruit flyâ€™s salivary gland,
stained with dye, and visualized under a microscope. Akin to miniature bar codes, chromosomes absorb dif
