 of alleles, is more likely in small populations because in small populations,
fewer individuals would have the opportunity to pass on a rare allele to the next generation than in a large
population. Choice (A) is incorrect because it is the opposite of the correct answer. Greater diversity does not
influence the chances of genetic drift, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because gene flow, or
migration, does not necessarily cause genetic drift.
2. (B) The bottleneck effect occurs when the majority of a population dies and the surviving individuals do not
possess all of the alleles from the original population. Choice (A) is incorrect because survival after bottleneck
events may be random and is not dependent on an organismâ€™s fitness. The founder effect occurs when a small
group of individuals leaves a larger population to colonize a new area. Since this scenario does not describe the
founder effect, choices (C) and (D) are incorrect. Also, nothing in the question pro
