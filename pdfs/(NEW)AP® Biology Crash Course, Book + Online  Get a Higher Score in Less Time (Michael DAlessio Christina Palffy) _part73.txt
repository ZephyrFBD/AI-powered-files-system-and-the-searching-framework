 cells die or have
other functions in reproduction.
Every AP® Biology test-taker should know the main differences between meiosis and mitosis. Mitosis produces diploid identical
cells that have no genetic variation. Meiosis produces gametes (haploid) that are genetically different because of crossing over
in Prophase I of meiosis. Similarly, you should know the stages of mitosis and meiosis and special structures that are formed.
