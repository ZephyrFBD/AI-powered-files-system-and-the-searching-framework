body fat for winter hibernation).
Parental Care and Fecundity
Fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population. In other words, fecundity describes
how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive

cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring. In animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental
care given to an individual offspring. Species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually
provide little if any care for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway). Most of their
energy budget is used to produce many tiny offspring. Animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a v
