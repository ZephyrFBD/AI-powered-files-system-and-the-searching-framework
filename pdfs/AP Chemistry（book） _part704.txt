t has passed from our hand to the container.
A process in which the system loses heat is called exothermic (exo- means “out 
of”). During an exothermic process, such as the combustion of gasoline, heat exits or 
flows out of the system into the surroundings [Figure 5.8(b)].
 
piston that makes a gas-tight seal so that the gases are a closed 
system. The cylinder is submerged in a large beaker of water 
whose temperature is 25 °C, and a spark is used to trigger a re-
action in the cylinder. At the completion of the reaction, the 
piston has moved downward, and the temperature of the water 
bath has increased to 28 °C. If we define the system as the gases 
inside the cylinder, which of the following best describes the 
signs of q, w, and ∆E for this reaction? 
(a) q 6 0, w 6 0, ∆E 6 0 
(b) q 6 0, w 7 0, ∆E 6 0 
(c) q 6 0, w 7 0,  the sign of ∆E cannot be determined from 
the information given  
(d) q 7 0, w 7 0, ∆E 7 0 
(e) q 7 0, w 6 0, the sign of ∆E cannot be determined from 
the info
