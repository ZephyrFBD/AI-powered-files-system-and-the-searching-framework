A. Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled at many levels as DNAâ€™s information is converted to mRNA and
then into protein.
Opportunities for Control over Eukaryotic Gene Expression
1. Only a small fraction of the genes in the genomes of multicellular organisms need to be expressed in
any given cell type at any given time.
2. Eukaryotic genes are not organized into operons as in bacteria.
i.
Each gene has its own promoter and other control elements present in the DNA sequences
surrounding the gene.
ii. Many types of regulatory proteins bind to these elements to determine the timing and level of
expression of any particular gene.
3. Controls over gene expression can occur before, during, or after transcription and translation.
i.
Before transcription can occur, the region of the genome in which the gene is located needs to be
unpackaged to allow access to regulatory proteins.
During interphase, some DNA remains as tightly packed as it was during mitosis and is
called heterochroma
