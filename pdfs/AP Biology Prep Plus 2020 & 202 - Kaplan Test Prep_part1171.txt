χ2 = 12.74
Rounded to the nearest tenth, the answer is 12.7. Therefore, (D) is correct.
57. B
When attempting to transform bacteria with a plasmid, only a small
percentage of the bacteria present will take up the plasmid. Because you
only want the transformed bacteria to proliferate, you need a way to
positively select for your recombinant colonies. Ampicillin-resistance is a
common strategy for positive selection, and without it, the student
wouldn’t be able to isolate the transformed bacteria; thus, you will choose
(B). While ampicillin-resistance is needed to isolate the transformed
bacteria, it’s not necessary for the actual production of insulin, thus (A) is
incorrect. Ampicillin-resistance is only required for the positive selection
of transformed colonies, not the insertion of the insulin gene into the
plasm
