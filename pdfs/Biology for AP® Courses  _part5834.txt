;
the genetic sequence of something that has never been found can’t
be known;
“variants” of something that hasn’t been shown to exist can’t be
known;
it’s impossible to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease
called Covid-19.

In as concise terms as possible, here’s the proper way to isolate,
characterize and demonstrate a new virus. First, one takes samples
(blood, sputum, secretions) from many people (e.g. 500) with
symptoms which are unique and speciﬁc enough to characterize an
illness. Without mixing these samples with ANY tissue or products
that also contain genetic material, the virologist macerates, ﬁlters
and ultracentrifuges i.e. purifies the specimen. This common virology
technique, done for decades to isolate bacteriophages1 and so-called
giant viruses in every virology lab, then allows the virologist to
demonstrate with electron microscopy thousands of identically sized
and shaped particles. These particles are the isolated and puriﬁed
virus.
These identical parti
