 be bound to actin in the low-energy conformation and be
unable to release it.
28.
D
Without calcium, myosin cannot bind to actin. With more EDTA, there should be more myosin alone, as
shown in (D). The states bound to actin will disappear.

A
Acid rain has high H+ and thus a low pH. Therefore, it would NOT increase the water pH (I). However,
these high H+ levels can harm fish (II) and change soil composition (III).
30.
B
The Krebs cycle reduces NAD+ to NADH. Therefore, NADH is produced. It also produces the electron
carrier FADH2.

D
The waxy cuticle helps prevent water loss. Water is important in the plant for maintaining a turgid
structure. The plant would not likely stand as tall, (A), it would dry out rapidly, (B), and it would grow
more roots to seek out more water, (C). This would not likely cause increased sugar transport, (D).

C
If the fossils had the same levels of decayed isotope, then they were likely living at the same time and if
they were found near each other,
