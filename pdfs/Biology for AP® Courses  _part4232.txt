with the coral. In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators,
herbivores, or planktivores. Predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or “flesh eaters.” Herbivores eat plant
material, and planktivores eat plankton.

Global Decline of Coral Reefs
It takes a long time to build a coral reef. The animals that create coral reefs have evolved over millions
of years, continuing to slowly deposit the calcium carbonate that forms their characteristic ocean homes.
Bathed in warm tropical waters, the coral animals and their symbiotic algal partners evolved to sur
