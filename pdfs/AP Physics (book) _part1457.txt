ated vapor pressure at
a given temperature. It is usually expressed as a percentage:
Thus, when the humidity is close to 100%, the air holds nearly all the water vapor
it can.
Relative humidity =
partial pressure of H2O
saturated vapor pressure of H2O * 100%.

Temperature and Kinetic Theory
† For example, 78% (by volume) of air molecules are nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with much smaller
amounts of water vapor, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. At an air pressure of 1 atm, oxygen
exerts a partial pressure of 0.21 atm and nitrogen 0.78 atm.

Humidity and comfort
Relative humidity. On a particular hot day, the tempera-
ture is 30°C and the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is 21.0 torr. What 
is the relative humidity?
APPROACH From Table 13–3, we see that the saturated vapor pressure of
water at 30°C is 31.8 torr.
