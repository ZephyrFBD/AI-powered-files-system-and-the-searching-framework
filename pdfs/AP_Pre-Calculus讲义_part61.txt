ln x = loge x 
The natural logarithmic function y = ln x is the inverse function of the natural exponential 
function y=ex. 
 
By the definition of inverse functions we have

2.7.1 Laws of Logarithms 
Since logarithms are exponents, the laws of exponents give rise to the laws of logarithms. 
Let a be a positive number, with a ≠ 1. Let A, B, and C be any real numbers with A > 0 and 
B > 0. 
 
 
Example 1 
Evaluate each expression. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7.2 Expanding and Combining Logarithmic Expressions 
The laws of logarithms allow us to write the logarithm of a product or a quotient as the sum 
or difference of logarithms. 
This process, called expanding a logarithmic expression, is illustrated in the next exampl
