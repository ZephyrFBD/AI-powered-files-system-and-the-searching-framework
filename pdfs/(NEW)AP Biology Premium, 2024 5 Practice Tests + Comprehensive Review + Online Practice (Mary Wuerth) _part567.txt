relationship, the symbiosis between them is
mutualistic. Niche partitioning is using different parts of a resource, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is
incorrect because commensalism benefits one member of the symbiosis but the other member neither benefits
nor is harmed. In parasitism, one member of the symbiosis benefits but the other is harmed, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
8. (C) Niche partitioning occurs when different species use a limited resource differently. The two species of
spiders use the same species of plant, but one species of spiders only uses plants in the shade while the other
only uses plants in open areas. So they partition the resource differently. Choice (A) is incorrect because the
spiders are not in direct competition for the same resource. This is not a mutualistic relationship between the
spiders because they do not provide a benefit to each other, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect
because the spiders do not prey on each other.
