cells can be stratified into layers, as in (b) this human cervix specimen. (credit b: modification of work by Ed Uthman;

Figure 24.7a illustrates a layer of squamous cells with their membranes joined together to form an epithelium. Image
Figure 24.7b illustrates squamous epithelial cells arranged in stratified layers, where protection is needed on the body from
outside abrasion and damage. This is called a stratified squamous epithelium and occurs in the skin and in tissues lining the
mouth and vagina.
Cuboidal Epithelia
Cuboidal epithelial cells, shown in Figure 24.8, are cube-shaped with a single, central nucleus. They are most commonly
found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and
secrete glandular material. They are also found in the walls of tubules and in the ducts of the kidney and liver.
