0.05), O is the observed value for variable i, and E is the
expected value for variable i. The Chi-square statistic table

40. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetic disorder in
which lipids with very high molecular weights are not
metabolized and accumulate within cells. Accumulation of
these fats in the brain damages the myelin that surrounds
nerves. This progressive disease has two causes: an
autosomal recessive allele, which causes neonatal ALD,
and a mutation in the ABCD1 gene located on the X
chromosome. A controversial treatment is the use of
Lorenzoâ€™s oil, which is expensive; despite this treatment,
neurological degradation persists in many patients. Gene
therapy as a potential treatment is currently in trials but is
also very costly.
An infant patient exhibits symptoms of neonatal ALD,
which are dif
