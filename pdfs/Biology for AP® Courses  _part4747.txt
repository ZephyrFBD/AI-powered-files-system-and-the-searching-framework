e, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each
year represents ten million species per year).
One contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. For birds alone this
method yields an estimate of 26 E/MSY. However, this value may be underestimated for three reasons. First, many species
would not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed. Second, the

number of recently extinct species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal remains. And
third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such. Taking
these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 E/MSY. The predicted rate by the end of the
century is 1500 E/MSY.
A second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is
