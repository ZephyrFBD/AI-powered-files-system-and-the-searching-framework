ribosomal precursors.
Ribosomes
Ribosomes are protein factories. They are not membrane-bound, and as
such, are not considered organelles. Ribosomes can be found freely
suspended in the cytosol or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Free

ribosomes are associated with protein produced for the cellâ€™s own use,
while ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum are meant for
export out of the cell. Cells, like pancreatic cells, that produce huge
amounts of hormones and digestive enzymes contain millions of
ribosomes.
Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are found in both plant and animal cells and perform a
specialized function. They contain catalase, which converts hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), a waste product of respiration in the cell, into water with
the release of oxygen atoms. They also detoxify alcohol in liver cells.
Endomembrane System
The endomembrane system regulates protein traffic and performs
metabolic functions in cells. It inclu
