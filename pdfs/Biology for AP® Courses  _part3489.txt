ts that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 29.25). This space is referred to as
the synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between
the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage,

and the entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint
while resisting dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are
capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint.
Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints.
Figure 29.25 Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or “synovial cavity” in the joint.
