Null Hypothesis—there is no statistical difference between expected data and observed data.
•
Alternative Hypothesis—another hypothesis that explains your observation.
Formula is 
o = observed number of individuals
e = expected number of individuals
Σ = sum of values
Degrees of freedom = expected phenotypes –1
Use of the Chi-Square Table of Critical Values

If the calculated chi-square is greater than or equal to the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected with
a reassurance of 95%, meaning only 5% of the time would you see the null hypothesis as being correct.
Sample Data
Result: There is no difference between observed and expected phenotypes; accept the null hypothesis.
