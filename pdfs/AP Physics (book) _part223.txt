along a straight tunnel as a
function of time is plotted in Fig. 2–44. What is its instan-
taneous velocity (a) at
and (b) at
What is its average velocity (c) between
and
(d) between 
and
and 
(e) between
and t = 50.0 s?
t = 40.0 s
t = 30.0 s,
t = 25.0 s
t = 5.0 s,
t = 0
t = 30.0 s?
t = 10.0 s
58. (II) In Fig. 2–44, (a) during what time periods, if any, is
the velocity constant? (b) At what time is the velocity
greatest? (c) At what time, if any, is the velocity zero?
(d) Does the object move in one direction or in both
directions during the time shown?
59. (III) Sketch the v vs.
graph for the object whose displace-
ment as a function of time is given by Fig. 2–44.

66. An airplane travels 2100 km at a speed of 
and
then encounters a tailwind that boosts its speed to 
for the next 2800 km. What was the total time for the trip?
What was the average speed of the plane for this trip?
[Hint: Does Eq. 2–11d apply?]
