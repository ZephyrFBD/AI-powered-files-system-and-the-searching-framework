e cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. They are also the
structural element of centrioles, flagella, and cilia.
4.6 Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities
Animal cells communicate via their extracellular matrices and are connected to each other via tight junctions,
desmosomes, and gap junctions. Plant cells are connected and communicate with each other via plasmodesmata.
When protein receptors on the surface of the plasma membrane of an animal cell bind to a substance in the extracellular
matrix, a chain of reactions begins that changes activities taking place within the cell. Plasmodesmata are channels
between adjacent plant cells, while gap junctions are channels between adjacent animal cells. However, their structures are
quite different. A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent cells, while a desmosome acts like a spot weld.
