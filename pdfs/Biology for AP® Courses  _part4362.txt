greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus.
Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then
population growth decreases as resources become depleted. This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called
exponential growth.
The best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission.
This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited
supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each
organism divides, resulting in 2000 organismsâ€”an increase of 1000. In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will
double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an
increase of 4000 organisms. The important concept of exponential gro
