SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
(general statement)
Do these processes violate the second law of thermodynamics? No, they do not.
In the processes of growth and evolution, and even during the mature life of 
an individual, waste products are eliminated. These small molecules that remain as
a result of metabolism are simple molecules without much order. Thus they repre-
sent relatively higher disorder or entropy. Indeed, the total entropy of the molecules
cast aside by organisms during the processes of development and growth is greater
than the decrease in entropy associated with the order of the growing individual
or evolving species.
“Time’s Arrow”
Another aspect of the second law of thermodynamics is that it tells us in which
direction processes go. If you were to see a film being run backward, you would
undoubtedly be able to tell that it was run backward. For you would see odd
occurrences, such as a bro
