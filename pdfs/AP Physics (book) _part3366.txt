 is a third related process. This is electron
capture (abbreviated EC in Appendix B) and occurs when a nucleus absorbs one
of its orbiting electrons. An example is 
which as a result becomes 
The
process is written
or, in general,
Usually it is an electron in the innermost (K) shell that is captured, in which case
the process is called K-capture. The electron disappears in the process, and a
proton in the nucleus becomes a neutron; a neutrino is emitted as a result. This
process is inferred experimentally by detection of emitted X-rays (due to other
electrons jumping down to fill the state of the captured 
).
30â€“6 Gamma Decay
Gamma rays are photons having very high energy. They have their origin in the
decay of a nucleus, much like emission of photons by excited atoms. Like an
atom, a nucleus itself can be in an excited state. When it jumps down to a lower
energy state, or to the ground state, it emits a photon which we call a 
ray. The
possible states of a nucleus are much farther apa
