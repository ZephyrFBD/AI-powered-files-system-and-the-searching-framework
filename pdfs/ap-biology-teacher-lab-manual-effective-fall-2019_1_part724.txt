as the rate of transpiration affected by your choice of experimental variable as 
compared to the control? 
2. Think of a way you can effectively communicate your results to other lab groups. 
By comparing results and conclusions, explain how changes or variables in 
environmental conditions affect transpiration rates. 
3. Based on data collected from different lab groups, which environmental variable(s) 
resulted in the greatest rate of water loss through transpiration? Explain why this 
factor might increase water loss when compared to other factors. 
4. Why did you need to calculate leaf surface area to determine the rate(s) of  
transpiration?

5. What structural or physiological adaptations enable plants to control water loss? 
How might each adaptation affect transpiration? 
6. Make a prediction about the number of stomata in a leaf and the rate of 
transpiration. What type(s) of experiments cou
