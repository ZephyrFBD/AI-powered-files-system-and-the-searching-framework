genetic tree or simply cladogram to determine evolutionary history and speciation.
Biology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious
response, but it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which
exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living
organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently,
virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise
to life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the
strict sense of the term.
From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something
“alive”? And o
