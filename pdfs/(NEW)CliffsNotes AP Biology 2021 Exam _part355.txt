cleus isolated from translation, which takes place in
the cytoplasm. This allows for a greater range of mechanisms to control gene expression.
In line with the complexity of eukaryotic cells, the mechanisms that regulate eukaryotic transcription are similarly
complex. Every stage that contributes to the final protein product, from accessing the gene in the chromatin to the
final folding of the translated protein, can be subject to some kind of regulation. Following are the more prominent
gene-regulating mechanisms that occur:
1. DNA methylation occurs when methyl groups (-CH3) attach to DNA
bases. This makes it more difficult for transcription factors to access the DNA. DNA methylation seems to be
associated with long-term inactivation of genes.
2. Histone modification refers to changes in the organization of histone proteins with DNA. The DNA double helix
in chromatin is wrapped around a bundle of eight histone molecules to form tightly knit complexes called
nucleosomes. Access to DNA
