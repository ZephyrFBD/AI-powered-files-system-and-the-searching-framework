to be used in jewelry, but alloys of gold are much harder (see “Chem-
istry Put to Work: Alloys of Gold”). Other common alloys are described in Table 12.2.
Alloys can be divided into four categories: substitutional alloys, interstitial alloys, 
heterogeneous alloys, and intermetallic compounds. Substitutional and interstitial 
alloys are both homogeneous mixtures in which components are dispersed randomly 
and uniformly (Figure 12.15). 
 (Section 1.2) Solids that form homogeneous mixtures 
are called solid solutions. When atoms of the solute in a solid solution occupy positions 
normally occupied by a solvent atom, we have a substitutional alloy. When the sol-
ute atoms occupy interstitial positions in the “holes” between solvent atoms, we have an 
interstitial alloy (Figure 12.15). 
Substitutional alloys are formed when the two metallic components have similar 
atomic radii and chemical-bonding characteristics. For example, silver and gold form 
such an alloy over the entire range of
