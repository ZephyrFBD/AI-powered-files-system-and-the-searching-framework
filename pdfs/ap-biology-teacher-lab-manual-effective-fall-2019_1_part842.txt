a 
progress or time-course curve. In contrast, a rate curve is a picture of the steepness of 
one or more progress curves, and any graph that has rate on one of its scales is a rate 
curve. 
So far we have been considering only rate graphs that have time on the abscissa; we 
could call these time-rate curves. As we have seen, a time-rate curve can be made from 
any progress curve. Next, we are going to consider rate curves that do not have time 
as the abscissa. As you shall see, such curves are made by combining data from several 
progress curves, each representing the time course of the reaction under a different set of 
conditions. 
â–  OTHER KINDS OF RATE GRAPHS 
Let us look at and try to analyze the graph in Figure A.18. Obviously, it is a progress 
curve because it shows an amount of something on the ordinate and time on the 
abscissa. There are several different curves all plotted on the same graph, and each is 
labeled with a different temperature. The title indicates that this g
