If this were the complete reaction, bromide ion would not be a catalyst because it under-
goes chemical change during the reaction. However, hydrogen peroxide also reacts with 
the Br21aq2 generated in Equation 14.32:
 
Br21aq2 + H2O21aq2 ยก 2 Br-1aq2 + 2 H +1aq2 + O21g2 
[14.33] 
of NO by assuming that an equilibrium is established in the first 
step.
Solve The second step is rate determining, so the overall rate is
Rate = k23N2O243Br24
We solve for the concentration of the intermediate N2O2 by as-
suming that an equilibrium is established in step 1; thus, the rates 
of the forward and reverse reactions in step 1 are equal:
k13NO42 = k-13N2O24
Solving for the concentration of the intermediate, N2O2, gives
3N2O24 =
k1
k-1
3NO42
Substituting this expression into the rate expression gives
Rate = k2
k1
k-1
3NO423Br24 = k3NO423Br24
Thus, this mechanism also yields a rate law consistent with the ex-
perimental one. Remember: There may be more than on
