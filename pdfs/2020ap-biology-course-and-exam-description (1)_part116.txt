EXCLUSION STATEMENT­
—Students 
must understand the underlying concepts and 
applications of this equation, but performing 
calculations using this equation are beyond the 
scope of the course and the AP Exam. 
ENE-1.G.2
The relative concentrations of substrates 
and products determine how efficiently an 
enzymatic reaction proceeds.
ENE-1.G.3
Higher environmental temperatures increase 
the speed of movement of molecules in a 
solution, increasing the frequency of collisions 
between enzymes and substrates and 
therefore increasing the rate of reaction.
