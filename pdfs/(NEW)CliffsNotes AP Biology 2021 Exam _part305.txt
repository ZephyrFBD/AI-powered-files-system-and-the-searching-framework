ng the first
possibility as an example, one would expect only two kinds of gametes in the absence of crossing overâ€” AB and ab
in equal quantities. Crossing over would produce gametes that are Ab and aB. If the two genes are very close
together, there would be very few crossovers because there are few places between the genes where the
chromosomes can break and cross over. If the genes are far apart, there would be many crossovers because there are
many places for chromosome breaks. When the genes are very far apart, they cross over so frequently that by
observing the allele frequencies of the gametes the genes seem to assort independently, as if they were on different
chromosomes (not linked). That is exactly what has happened in this question. The observed frequencies are those
that would have been expected had the genes been on different chromosomes. Since the question states that the
genes are linked, they must be far apart to allow so large a number of crossovers.
