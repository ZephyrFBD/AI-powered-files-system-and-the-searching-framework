nscribed inside to denote delocalized p bonds. 
Each vertex represents a carbon atom. Each carbon is bound to three other atoms—either three 
carbons, or two carbons and a hydrogen—so that each carbon has the requisite four bonds.

From the second and third reactions, it appears that the energy released upon hydroge-
nation of each double bond is roughly 118 kJ/mol for each bond. Benzene contains the 
equivalent of three double bonds. We might expect, therefore, the energy released upon 
hydrogenation of benzene to be about 3 times -118, or -354 kJ>mol, if benzene behaved 
as though it were “cyclohexatriene,” that is, if it behaved as though it had three isolated 
double bonds in a ring. Instead, the energy released is 146 kJ less than this, indicating that 
benzene is more stable than would be expected for three double bonds. The difference of 
146 kJ>mol between the expected heat of hydrogenation 1-354 kJ
