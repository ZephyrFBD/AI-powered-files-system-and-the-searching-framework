 of
prokaryotic structure because they lack organelles, eliminating (A) and (D). The most likely conclusion is that
this organism is a bacterial species.

B
Although many of the mentioned organelles work closely together, the only choice that can be correct is (B).
Ribosomes translate and manufacture proteins, often on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Those proteins are
then packaged in the Golgi bodies into vesicles, which are then fused with the plasma membrane. Choice (A)
is incorrect because the nuclear envelope and nucleolus do not interact with vacuoles; they interact with the
centrioles only during mitosis. Choice (C) is incorrect because ribosomes don’t often interact with
mitochondria, and lysosomes interact only with mitochondria and chloroplasts when they degrade those
organelles. Choice (D) is incorrect because the nucleolus doesn’t interact with the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum, lysosomes, or centrioles.

Estrogen is said to be lipid-soluble. This means it can slip t
