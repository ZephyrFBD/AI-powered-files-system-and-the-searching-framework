 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.D
Growth and dynamic homeostasis of a biological system are influenced by changes in the
system’s environment.
Essential
Knowledge
2.D.2 Homeostatic mechanisms reflect both common ancestry and divergence due to
adaptation in different environments.
