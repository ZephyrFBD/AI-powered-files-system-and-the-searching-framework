t fly Drosophila, the slx gene determines sex. This gene is expressed when the
organism has two copies of the X chromosome. The gene product for slx binds to the mRNA of the tra gene and regulates
its splicing. In the presence of slx, tra is spliced into its female form and influences the expression of dsx and fru to result in
female sexual characteristics. In the absence of slx, tra is spliced into its male form and male sexual characteristics result.

Figure 16.9 In Drosophila melanogaster, the sex is determined by a series of splicing events in sex determination
genes on a cell-by-cell basis without any involvement of sex hormones (which circulate throughout the entire
body). The primary sex-determination gene is Sex lethal (Sxl), which is transcribed only when the X/A ratio (the X
chromosome-to-autosome ratio) equals or exceeds 1. As females have two X chromosomes and mal
