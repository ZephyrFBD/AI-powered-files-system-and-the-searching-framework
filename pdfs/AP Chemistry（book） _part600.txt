▶Practice Exercise 2
Which of the following metals will be oxidized by 
Pb1NO322: Zn, Cu, Fe?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two substances—an aqueous salt, FeCl2, and 
a metal, Mg—and asked if they react with each other.
Plan A reaction occurs if the reactant that is a metal in its elemen-
tal form (Mg) is located above the reactant that is a metal in its ox-
idized form 1Fe2+2 in Table 4.5. If the reaction occurs, the Fe2+ ion 
in FeCl2 is reduced to Fe, and the Mg is oxidized to Mg2+.
Solve Because Mg is above Fe in the table, the reaction occurs. To 
write the formula for the salt produced in the reaction, we must 
remember the charges on common ions. Magnesium is always 
present in compounds as Mg2+; the chloride ion is Cl-. The mag-
nesium salt formed in the reaction is MgCl2, meaning the bal-
anced molecular equation is
Mg1s2 + FeCl21aq2 ¡ MgCl21aq2 + Fe1s2
Both FeCl2 and MgCl2 are soluble strong electrolytes and can be 
written in ionic form, which shows us that Cl- is
