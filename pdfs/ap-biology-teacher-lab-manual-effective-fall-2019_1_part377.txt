ould measure any of the following:
Bullet Consumption of O2 during the oxidation of glucose (How many moles of O2 are 
consumed when one mole of glucose is oxidized?)
Bullet Production of CO2 during aerobic respiration (How many moles of CO2 are produced 
when one mole of glucose is oxidized?)
Bullet Release of energy in the form of heat as one mole of glucose is oxidized
In Getting Started, students conduct prelab research on the process of cellular respiration 
and review concepts they may have studied previously.

In Procedures, students learn how to calculate the rate of cellular respiration by 
using a respirometer system (microrespirometers or gas pressure sensors with computer 
interface) that measures the relative volume (changes in pressure) as oxygen is consumed 
by germinating plant seeds at room temperature (20Â°C). As oxygen is consumed during 
respiration, it is normally replaced b
