n electric blanket or construct a 
homemade incubator with a cardboard 
box and a low voltage lightbulb inside. 
Otherwise, incubate agar plates with 
bacteria 48–72 hours at ambient room 
temperature. Another option is to use 
a seedling heating mat with thermostat 
available from garden supply catalogs; 
the advantage is that they are sealed 
against water damage and can be repur­
posed for other lab activities, including 
their original purpose, germinating 
seeds.
