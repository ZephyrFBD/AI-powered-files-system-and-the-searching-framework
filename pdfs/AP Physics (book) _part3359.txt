st when an electron is emitted, and the total number
of nucleons, A, is the same in the daughter nucleus as in the parent. But because
an electron has been emitted from the nucleus itself, the charge on the daughter
nucleus is 
greater than that on the parent. The parent nucleus in the decay
written above had
so from charge conservation the nucleus remaining
behind must have a charge of 
So the daughter nucleus has 
which is
nitrogen.
It must be carefully noted that the electron emitted in 
decay is not an orbital
electron. Instead, the electron is created within the nucleus itself. What happens is
that one of the neutrons changes to a proton and in the process (to conserve
charge) emits an electron. Indeed, free neutrons actually do decay in this fashion:
To remind us of their origin in the nucleus, the electrons emitted in 
decay are
often referred to as “
particles.” They are, nonetheless, indistinguishable from
orbital electrons.
