ensity, including weather, natural disasters, and pollution. An individual deer may be killed in a forest fire regardless of
how many deer happen to be in that area. Its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low.
The same holds true for cold winter weather.
In real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact.
A dense population that is reduced in a density-independent manner by some environmental factor(s) will be able to recover
differently than a sparse population. For example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there
are more deer remaining to reproduce.
Think About It
Describe an example of how density-dependent and density-independent factors might interact.
