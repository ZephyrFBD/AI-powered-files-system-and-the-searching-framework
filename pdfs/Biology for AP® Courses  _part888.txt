ylase complex comes into play.
c.
Removal of a carbonyl group from pyruvate
releases carbon dioxide. The pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex comes into play.
d.
Removal of an acetyl group from pyruvate
releases carbon dioxide. The pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex comes into play.
32. What three steps are included in the breakdown of
pyruvate?
a.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase removes a carboxyl
group from pyruvate producing carbon dioxide.
Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase oxidizes a
hydroxyethyl group to an acetyl group,
producing NADH. Lastly, an enzyme-bound
acetyl group is transferred to CoA, producing a
molecule of acetyl-CoA.
b.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase oxidizes hydroxyethyl
group to an acetyl group, producing NADH. It
further removes a carboxyl group from pyruvate
producing carbon dioxide. Lastly, dihydrolipoyl
transacetylase transfers enzyme-bound acetyl
group to CoA forming an acetyl-CoA molecule.
c.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase transfers enzyme-
bound acetyl group to CoA forming an acetyl
CoA molecule.
