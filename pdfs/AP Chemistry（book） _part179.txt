however, that precise measurements can be inaccurate. For example, if a very sensitive 
balance is poorly calibrated, the masses we measure will be consistently either high or 
low. They will be inaccurate even if they are precise.

Suppose you determine the mass of a dime on a balance capable of measuring to the 
nearest 0.0001 g. You could report the mass as 2.2405 { 0.0001 g. The {  notation 
(read “plus or minus”) expresses the magnitude of the uncertainty of your measurement. 
In much scientific work, we drop the {  notation with the understanding that there is 
always some uncertainty in the last digit reported for any measured quantity.
Figure 1.25 shows a thermometer with its liquid column between two scale marks. 
We can read the certain digits from the scale and estimate the uncertain one. Seeing that 
the liquid is between the 25 °C and 30 °C marks, we estimate the tempe
