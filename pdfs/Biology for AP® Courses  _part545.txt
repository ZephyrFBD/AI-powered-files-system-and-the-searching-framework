Membrane Fluidity
The mosaic characteristic of the membrane, described in the fluid mosaic model, helps to illustrate its nature. The
integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules. These resemble the separate,
multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float, moving somewhat with respect to one another. The membrane is not
like a balloon, however, that can expand and contract; rather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in
too much water. However, because of its mosaic nature, a ver
