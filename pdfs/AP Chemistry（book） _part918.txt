an can be done with visible light 11000*2, 
because the wavelength of the electrons is so much smaller than the wavelength of 
visible light.
Sample Exercise 6.5 
Matter Waves
What is the wavelength of an electron moving with a speed of 5.97 * 106 m>s? The mass of the electron is 9.11 * 10 - 31 kg.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the mass, m, and velocity, v, of the electron, 
and we must calculate its de Broglie wavelength, l.
Plan The wavelength of a moving particle is given by Equation 6.8, 
so l is calculated by inserting the known quantities h, m, and v. In 
doing so, however, we must pay attention to units.
Comment By comparing this value with the wavelengths of elec-
tromagnetic radiation shown in Figure 6.4, we see that the wave-
length of this electron is about the same as that of X rays.

Consider the following three moving objects: (i) a golf ball 
with a mass of 45.9 g moving at a speed of 50.0 m>s, (ii) An 
electron moving at a speed of 3.50 * 105 m>s,
