lead to multiple speciation events originating from a
single species. This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing
the species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for
adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms.
The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, called the founder species,
numerous species have evolved, including the six shown in Figure 18.15.

Figure 18.15 The honeycreeper birds illustrate adaptive radiation. From one original species of bird, multiple others
evolved, each with its own distinctive characteristics.
