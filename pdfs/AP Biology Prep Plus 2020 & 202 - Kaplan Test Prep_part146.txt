 center of the membrane. The attraction
between the nonpolar regions of these phospholipids creates the
foundation for the bilayer of the membrane. The lipid ends group
together like the insides of a sandwich, surrounded by polar barriers.

AP EXPERT NOTE
Make sure you are familiar with the structure and function of
macromolecules as they relate to the plasma membrane
structure. Be able to identify the general structures and functions
of phospholipids, proteins, and cholesterol.
Phospholipid Bilayer
Embedded among all of these membrane lipids are proteins,
carbohydrates, and sterols (like cholesterol). Some proteins are
embedded on the outer surface, some on the inner surface, and some
span the entire width of the plasma membrane (these usually function as
transport proteins). Some surface proteins have sugar groups attached to
them, called glycoproteins.
Each component of a cell membrane contributes to how th
