Interpreting and Evaluating Experimental Results (Question 1 on the AP Exam)
In many countries, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting 
the parasite that causes malaria to people through their bites. A primary tool for 
mosquito control is the use of insecticidal nets sprayed with chemicals known as 
pyrethroids, which are relatively safe for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However, 
mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has now become widespread. Pyrethroids 
interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells 
of the mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a 
phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino acid position 1014. Scientists 
hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance.
