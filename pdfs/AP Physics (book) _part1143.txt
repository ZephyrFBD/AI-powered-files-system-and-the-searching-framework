Let us examine what happens when our uniform spring is initially compressed
a distance
as shown in Fig. 11–2a, and then our object of mass m is
released on the frictionless surface. The spring exerts a force on the mass that accel-
erates it toward the equilibrium position. Because the mass has inertia, it passes
the equilibrium position with considerable speed. Indeed, as the mass reaches the
equilibrium position, the force on it decreases to zero, but its speed at this point is
a maximum,
(Fig. 11–2b). As the mass moves farther to the right, the force 
on it acts to slow it down, and it stops for an instant at 
(Fig. 11–2c). It
then begins moving back in the opposite di
