are
small. When a population bottleneck occurs as a result of some catastrophic event (flood, epidemic, ice age), the
small surviving population may change due to genetic drift. A founder population may also be subject to the effects
of genetic drift. For example, if a small group of individuals becomes separated from the mother population (perhaps
by emigration), the allele frequencies of the founder group may differ from the mother population by chance.
c. Evolution may also occur when allele frequencies change due to gene flowâ€”the movement of alleles between
populations. Gene flow occurs when individuals immigrate, bringing alleles into the population, or when they
emigrate, removing alleles from the population. When gene flow causes a change in the relative frequencies of
alleles, evolution occurs.
d. Nonrandom mating may also contribute to changes in allele frequencies, and, therefore, cause evolution.
Nonrandom mating increases the frequencies of alleles for traits that occur amo
