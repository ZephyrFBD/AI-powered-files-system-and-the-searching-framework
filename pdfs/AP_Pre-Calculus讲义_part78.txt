3.3 Sine and Cosine Function Graphs and Transformations 
3.3.1 Graphs of Sine and Cosine 
To help us graph the sine and cosine functions, we first observe that these functions 
repeat their values in a regular fashion. 
In other words, 
 
Thus, the sine and cosine functions are periodic according to the following definition: A 
function f is periodic if there is a positive number p such that f (t + p) = f (t) for every t. 
 
PERIODIC PROPERTIES OF SINE AND COSINE 
The functions sine and cosine have period 2π: 
 
So the sine and cosine functions repeat their values in any interval of length 2π. To sketch 
their graphs, we first graph one period. 
To sketch the graphs , we could try to make a table of values of those points to draw the 
graph. 
 
Now we use this
