 envelope on
the exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space (Figure 5.23). Other examples
of cells releasing molecules via exocytosis include the secretion of proteins of the extracellular matrix and secretion of
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by synaptic vesicles.
Figure 5.23 In exocytosis, vesicles containing substances fuse with the plasma membrane. The contents are then
released to the exterior of the cell. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
