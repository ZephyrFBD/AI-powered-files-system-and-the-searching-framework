The oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in
contact with the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-
like projections called fimbriae, illustrated in Figure 34.12b. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the
non-motile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly
of smooth muscle. The cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the
egg toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the
uterus for development. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct. Sterilization in women is
called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a
