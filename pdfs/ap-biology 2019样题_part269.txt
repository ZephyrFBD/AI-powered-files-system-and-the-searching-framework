writing what has 
been learned; pairing with 
a peer or a small group to 
share ideas; sharing ideas 
and discussion with a 
larger group.
Constructs meaning about 
a topic or question; tests 
thinking in relation to the 
ideas of others; prepares 
for a discussion with a 
larger group.
When teaching about biological 
molecules, for example, ask 
students to reflect on their 
current learning by asking them 
to think about the following 
prompt: “Explain why lipids 
are nonpolar and insoluble in 
water.” Once students have had 
a minute or two to think about 
the question, they can turn to 
a neighbor or shoulder-partner 
and then share their answer. 
After two to three minutes 
of sharing, the teacher can 
engage the class in a whole-
group discussion to ensure 
that students are building 
the necessary foundational 
understandings.
