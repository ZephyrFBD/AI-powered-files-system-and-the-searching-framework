ber that in prokaryotes, DNA is organized into a single
circular chromosome. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of
chromosomes in the nucleus of each cell. For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is
eight. Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the
cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins are attached to chromosomes, and they resemble an
unwound, jumbled bunch of threads. These unwound protein-chromosome complexes are called chromatin (Figure 4.12);
chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed.
