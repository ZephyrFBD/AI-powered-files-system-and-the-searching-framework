will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a speciesâ€™ young (Figure 1.12) will grow up to exhibit many of
the same characteristics as its parents.

Regulation
Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions,
respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are
nutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying
oxygen throughout the body, remov
