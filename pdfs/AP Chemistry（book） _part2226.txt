[14.18]
To determine the potential importance of CH3Br in destruction 
of the ozone layer, it is important to know how rapidly the reaction in 
Equation 14.18 and all other reactions remove CH3Br from the lower 
atmosphere before it can diffuse into the stratosphere.
The average lifetime of CH3Br in Earth’s lower atmo-
sphere is difficult to measure because the conditions that 
exist in the atmosphere are too complex to be simulated 
in the laboratory. Instead, scientists analyzed nearly 4000 
atmospheric samples collected above the Pacific Ocean for 
the presence of several trace organic substances, including 
methyl bromide. From these measurements, it was possible 
to estimate the atmospheric residence time for CH3Br.
The atmospheric residence time is related to the half-
life for CH3Br in the lower atmosphere, assuming CH3Br 
decomposes by a first-order process. From the experimental 
data, the half-life for methyl bromide in the lower atmo-
sphe
