otes their intervening role), which may be involved in gene
regulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional
proteins.
The discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein
sequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. The genes of higher eukaryotes very often
contain one or more introns. These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of
having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. It is possible that introns slow down gene expression
because it takes longer to transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns. Alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence
remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes throughout evolution. This is supported by the fact that separate exons
often encode separate protein subunits or domains. For the most part, the sequences
