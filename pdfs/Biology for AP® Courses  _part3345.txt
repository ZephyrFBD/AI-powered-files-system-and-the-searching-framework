bulin. T3
has three iodine ions attached, while T4 has four iodine ions attached. T3 and T4 are then released into the bloodstream, with
T4 being released in much greater amounts than T3. As T3 is more active than T4 and is responsible for most of the effects
of thyroid hormones, tissues of the body convert T4 to T3 by the removal of an iodine ion. Most of the released T3 and
T4 becomes attached to transport proteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells. These
protein-bound molecules are only released when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline. In this way, a
weekâ€™s worth of reserve hormone is maintained in the blood. Increased T3 and T4 levels in the blood inhibit the release of
TSH, which results in lower T3 and T4 release from the thyroid.
The follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize T3 and T4. Iodides obtained
from the diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a
