The Calvin Cycle
After the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the
cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. The products of the light-dependent
reactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-
independent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years. The
carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms. Where does the carbon come from? It comes from
carbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.
In plants, carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances thr
