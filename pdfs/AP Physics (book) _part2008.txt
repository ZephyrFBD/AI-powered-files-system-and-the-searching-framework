at it has a resting potential
(most cells do), but rather that it can respond to a stimulus and conduct an elec-
trical signal along its length. The stimulus could be thermal (when you touch a
hot stove) or chemical (as in taste buds); it could be pressure (as on the skin or at
the eardrum), or light (as in the eye); or it could be the electric stimulus of a
signal coming from the brain or another neuron. In the laboratory, the stimulus is
usually electrical and is applied by a tiny probe at some point on the neuron. If
the stimulus exceeds some threshold, a voltage pulse will travel down the axon.
This voltage pulse can be detected at a point on the axon using a voltmeter or an
oscilloscope connected as in Fig. 18–29. This voltage pulse has the shape shown
in Fig. 18–30, and is called an action potential. As can be seen, the potential
increases from a resting potential of about 
and becomes a positive
30 mV or 40 mV. The action potential lasts for about 1 ms and travels down an
axon w
