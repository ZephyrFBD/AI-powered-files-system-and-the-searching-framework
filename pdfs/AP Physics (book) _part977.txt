A modern dome. The
dome of the Small Sports
Palace in Rome (Fig. 9–34a) is supported by 36 buttresses positioned at a 
38° angle so that they connect smoothly with the dome. Calculate the compo-
nents of the force,
and 
that each buttress exerts on the dome so that the
force acts purely in compression—th
