. Mucus
is high in water. As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. These processes help equilibrate
the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air
is removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia. The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are
important protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs. Thus, inhalation serves several purposes in
addition to bringing oxygen into the respiratory system.

Figure 30.7 Air enters the respiratory system through the nasal cavity and pharynx, and then passes through the
trachea and into the bronchi, which bring air into the lungs. (credit: modification of work by NCI)
In which order does inhaled air travel from the pharynx to the bronchioles?
a.
pharynx → trachea → larynx → bronchi→ bronchioles.
b.
pharynx → larynx → trachea → bronchi→ bronchioles
