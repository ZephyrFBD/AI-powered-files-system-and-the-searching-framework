3. During replication, the two strands of a DNA molecule are labeled the “leading strand” and the “lagging strand.”
Describe how replication differs between these two strands.
4. In the presence of oxygen, cells carry out aerobic respiration to generate ATP. When oxygen is absent, some cells
begin anaerobic respiration.
a. How does anaerobic respiration contribute to the survival of the cell in the absence of oxygen?
b. How productive is anaerobic respiration compared to aerobic respiration?
5. A marsupial mammal, such as a kangaroo, gives birth to young at a very early developmental stage. The young
continue their development in the mother’s pouch. In contrast, placental mammals are more fully developed at birth
because they spend much more time in the uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta. There are marsupial
“mice,” “rabbits,” “cats,” “wolves,” and other marsupials that look and act like their placental counterparts.
However, molecular analysis shows
