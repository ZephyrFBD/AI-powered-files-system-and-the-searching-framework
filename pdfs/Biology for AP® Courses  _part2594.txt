kely to be vascular plants. These plants have tissues that
conduct food and water (the word “vascular” means “having vessels”). While each vascular plant species is unique, all
are made up of a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves. They also all transport water, minerals, and sugars
produced through photosynthesis through the plant body using the same mechanism, and they all respond to environmental
factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation. Scientists recently discovered that two plants, the
giant goldenrod and spicebush, each make five different compounds that disrupt the life cycles of insect pests. Further
investigation into the chemicals could lead to a new class of pesticides.
