 much matter to you, but to me it's so serious, so intensely serious."
I was sorry if I had seemed impatient or flippant.
"Will you do something for me?" asked Stroeve.
"Willingly."
"Will you write to Blanche for me?"
"Why can't you write yourself?"
"I've written over and over again. I didn't expect her to answer. I don't think she reads the letters."
"You make no account of feminine curiosity. Do you think she could resist?"
"She could -- mine."
I looked at him quickly. He lowered his eyes. That answer of his seemed to me strangely 
humiliating. He was conscious that she regarded him with an indifference so profound that the 
sight of his handwriting would have not the slightest effect on her.
"Do you really believe that she'll ever come back to you?" I asked.
"I want her to know that if the worst comes to the worst she can count on me. That's what I want 
you to tell her."
I took a sheet of paper.
"What is it exactly you wish me to say?"
This is what I wrote:
