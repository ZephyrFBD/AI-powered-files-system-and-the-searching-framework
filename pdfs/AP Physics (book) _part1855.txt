Work required to bring two positive charges close
together. What minimum work must be done by an external force to bring a
charge
from a great distance away (take
) to a point 0.500 m
from a charge 
APPROACH To find the work we cannot simply multiply the force times distance
because the force is proportional to 
and so is not constant. Instead we can
set the change in potential energy equal to the (positive of the) work required of an
external force (Chapter 6, Eq. 6–7a), and Eq. 17–3:
We get the potentials 
and 
using Eq. 17–5.
SOLUTION The external work required is equal to the change in potential energy:
