 a second X chromosome, he must have the disease
if he receives the diseased X chromosome.

D
They both must have a normal copy of the X chromosome. It is possible that the woman may be affected
with hemophilia; however, that scenario is extremely unlikely because such a case would require two
diseased copies of the X chromosome.
6.
D
Essentially, transmission of hemophilia to a girl born with Turner syndrome would be very similar to the
conditions by which a boy would receive the disease. Both boys and girls with Turner syndrome have
only one copy of the X chromosome. Therefore, they both would have a 50 percent chance of receiving
the diseased copy of the X chromosome.

B
Choice (A) is true, but it doesnâ€™t explain why the parents are normal. Choice (B) is a better explanation.
Carriers of recessive genetic diseases frequently do not have a recognizable phenotype because one
normal allele provides enough functioning protein to avoid the ill effects of the disease allele. Choice (C
