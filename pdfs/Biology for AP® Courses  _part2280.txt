eukaryotic cells developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between two species, one an Archaea and the other a
Bacteria. As mentioned, some eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea, whereas others resemble those from Bacteria.
An endosymbiotic fusion event, such as Lake has proposed, would clearly explain this observation. On the other hand, this
work is new and the CR algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated, which causes many scientists to resist this hypothesis.
More recent work by Lake (Figure 20.15b) proposes that gram-negative bacteria, which are unique within their domain

in that they contain two lipid bilayer membranes, indeed resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial
species. The double membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second
