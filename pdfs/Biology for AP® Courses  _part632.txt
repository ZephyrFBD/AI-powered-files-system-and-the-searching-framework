TP production by
inhibiting several of the enzymes in the oxidative
phosphorylation pathway. Some of the symptoms of
arsenic poisoning are similar to cystic fibrosis (difficulty
breathing and frequent lung infections). Explain what
impact arsenic poisoning may have on components of the
plasma membrane and transport that result in CF like
symptoms.
a.
Arsenic poisoning disrupts ATP production,
leading to decreased transport of Cl−
ions by
epithelial cells. This leads to decreased
electrolyte concentration in the mucus and
retention of water into the cells. The mucus
becomes dehydrated, as in CF.
b.
Arsenic poisoning disrupts the Na+ / Cl−
pump, leading to decreased transport of Cl−
ions outside the epithelial cells. This increases
the electrolyte concentration in the mucus and
movement of water out of the cells. The mucus
becomes hydrated as in CF.
c.
Arsenic poisoning affects the oxidative
phosphorylation pathway, leading to decreased
transport of Na+
ions outside the epithelial
cells.
