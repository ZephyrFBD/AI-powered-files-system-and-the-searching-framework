to the original strand. Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect because DNA
replication does not incorporate Uâ€™s into the new strand; the base pair uracil is only found in RNA.
38. (B) DNA replication is semiconservative, because each strand of DNA produced during DNA replication
contains one original strand from the template DNA and one newly synthesized DNA strand. Choice (A) is
incorrect because the entire DNA is copied during DNA replication. While newly synthesized DNA does
contain parent and daughter DNA, it is not a random mixture of the two (one strand is from the parent molecule
and one strand is newly synthesized). Thus, choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because the original
DNA molecule is separated into two strands during DNA replication and each of those strands serves as a
template for a new molecule of DNA.
39. (A) On the lagging strand, short fragments of new DNA are synthesized discontinuously during DNA
replication. Choice (B) is incorrect because the leading
