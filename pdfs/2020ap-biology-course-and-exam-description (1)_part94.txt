Describe the roles of each 
of the components of the 
cell membrane in maintaining 
the internal environment of 
the cell.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.A.1
Phospholipids have both hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic 
phosphate regions of the phospholipids are 
oriented toward the aqueous external or 
internal environments, while the hydrophobic 
fatty acid regions face each other within the 
interior of the membrane.
ENE-2.A.2
Embedded proteins can be hydrophilic, with 
charged and polar side groups, or hydrophobic, 
with nonpolar side groups.
ENE-2.B
Describe the Fluid Mosaic 
Model of cell membranes.
ENE-2.B.1
Cell membranes consist of a structural 
framework of phospholipid molecules that is 
embedded with proteins, steroids (such as 
cholesterol in eukaryotes), glycoproteins, and 
glycolipids that can flow around the surface of 
the cell within the membrane.
