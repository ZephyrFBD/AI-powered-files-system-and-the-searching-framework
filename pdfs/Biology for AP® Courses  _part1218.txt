ucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy level—diploid for most plants and
animals. Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the
nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis
consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division. Because the events that occur during
each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. However, because
there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a “I” or a “II.” Thus, meiosis I is the
first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Meiosis II, in which the second round
of meiotic division takes place, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.
Meiosis I
Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of
