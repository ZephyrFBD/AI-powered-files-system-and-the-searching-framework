Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are made up of many repeated units of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides can consist of branched
or unbranched chains of monosaccharides. The most common polysaccharides you’ll need to know for the test are

and starch stores sugar in plants. Cellulose, on the other hand, is made up of β-glucose and is a major part of the cell

structural molecule in the walls of fungus and in the exoskeletons of arthropods.
