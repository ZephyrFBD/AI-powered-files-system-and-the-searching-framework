2. The intracellular pH of human cells is approximately 7.4. Yet, the pH within the lumen (inside) of the human
stomach averages 1.5. Which of the following accurately describes the difference between the acidity of the
cellular and gastric pH?
(A) Gastric juices contain approximately 6 times more H+ ions than the intracellular cytoplasm of cells and are
more acidic.
(B) Gastric juices contain approximately 1,000,000-fold more H+ ions than the intracellular cytoplasm of cells
and are more acidic.
(C) The intracellular cytoplasm of cells contain approximately 6 times more H+ ions than gastric juices and is
more acidic.
(D) The intracellular cytoplasm of cells contains approximately 1,000,000-fold more H+ ions than gastric juices
and is more acidic.
3. Catabolism refers to breaking down complex macromolecules into their basic components. Many biological
processes use hydrolysis for catabolism. Hydrolysis of proteins could directly result in
