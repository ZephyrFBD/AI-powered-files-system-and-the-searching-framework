the water molecules have been moved apart so that the  
solute particles can be seen clearly.
*The chemical formula of acetic acid is sometimes written HC2H3O2 so that the formula looks 
like that of other common acids such as HCl. The formula 1CH3COOH2 conforms to the molec-
ular structure of acetic acid, with the acidic H on the O atom at the end of the formula.

but the amount that does dissolve dissociates almost completely. Thus, Ca1OH22 is a 
strong electrolyte.
When a weak electrolyte, such as acetic acid, ionizes in solution, we write the reac-
tion in the form
 
CH3COOH1aq2 ∆ CH3COO-1aq2 + H+1aq2 
[4.1]
The half-arrows pointing in opposite directions mean that the reaction is significant in 
both directions. At any given moment some CH3COOH molecules are ionizing to form 
H+ and CH3COO- ions, and some of the H+ and CH3COO- ions are recombining to form 
CH3COOH. The balance between these opposing processes determines
