ere detected in 1983 (Fig. 32–10). The quantum
(or carrier) of the gravitational force has been named the graviton, but its
existence has not been detected and it may not be detectable.
A comparison of the four forces is given in Table 32–1, where they are listed
according to their (approximate) relative strengths. Although gravity may be the
most obvious force in daily life (because of the huge mass of the Earth), on a
nuclear scale gravity is by far the weakest of the four forces and its effect at the
particle level can nearly always be ignored.
