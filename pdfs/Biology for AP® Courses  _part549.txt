The Components and Functions of the Plasma Membrane
Component
Location
Phospholipid
Main fabric of the membrane
Cholesterol
Attached between phospholipids and between the two
phospholipid layers
Integral proteins (for example, integrins)
Embedded within the phospholipid layer(s). May or may not
penetrate through both layers
Peripheral proteins
On the inner or outer surface of the phospholipid bilayer; not
embedded within the phospholipids
Carbohydrates (components of
glycoproteins and glycolipids)
Generally attached to proteins on the outside membrane layer

Immunologist
The variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cellâ€™s recognition sites are of prime
interest in immunology. These changes are taken into consideration in vaccine devel
