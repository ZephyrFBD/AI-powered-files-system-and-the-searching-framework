 Area of a Cube:SA 
=
 6  s^2
Surface Area of a Rectangular Solid: 
SA= 2 l h + 2 l w + 2 w h
Surface Area of a Cylinder: SA = 2 Pi r h + 2 Pi r^2
r = radius
 l = length
 h = heigh
t w = wid
th s = length of one side of a cube

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.B
Explain the effect of surface 
area-to-volume ratios on 
the exchange of materials 
between cells or organisms 
and the environment.
ENE-1.B.2
The surface area of the plasma membrane 
must be large enough to adequately 
exchange materials— 
a. These limitations can restrict cell size 
and shape. Smaller cells typically have a
