: mitochondria have
inter-membrane space, inner folds called cristae,
ATP synthase for ATP synthesis, and DNA;
chloroplast contains accessory pigments in
thylakoids, which, form grana and a stroma.
36. Is the nuclear membrane part of the endomembrane
system? Why or why not?
Chapter 4 | Cell Structure

a.
The nuclear membrane is not a part of the
endomembrane system as the endoplasmic
reticulum is a separate organelle of the cell.
b.
The nuclear membrane is considered a part of
the endomembrane system as it is continuous
with the Golgi body.
c.
The nuclear membrane is part of the
endomembrane system as it is continuous with
the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
d.
The nuclear membrane is not considered a part
of the endomembrane system as the nucleus is a
separate organelle.
37. What happens to the proteins that are synthesized on
free ribosomes in the cytoplasm? Do they go through the
Golgi apparatus?
a.
These proteins move through the Golgi
apparatus and enter in the nucleus.
b.
These p
