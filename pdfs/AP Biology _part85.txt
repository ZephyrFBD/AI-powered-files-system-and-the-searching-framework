TRANSPORT: Molecules, electrons, and ions are carried through
channels, pumps, carriers, and electron transport chains, which
manufacture ATP.
ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY: One membrane-bound enzyme is adenylate
cyclase, which synthesizes cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP.
SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION: Binding sites on protein receptors fit
chemical messengers (signaling molecule) like hormones. The
protein changes shape and relays the message to the inside of the
cell.
CELL-TO-CELL 
RECOGNITION: Some glycoproteins serve as
identification flags that are recognized by other cells.
CELL-TO-CELL ATTACHMENTS: Desmosomes, gap junctions, and
tight junctions are examples.
ATTACHMENT 
TO 
THE 
CYTOSKELETON 
AND 
EXTRACELLULAR
MATRIX: This helps maintain cell shape and stabilizes the location
of certain membrane proteins.
TRANSPORT INTO AND OUT OF THE CELL
Transport is the movement of substances into and out of a cell. Transport
can be either active or passive. Active transport requires energy (ATP).
Passive tran
