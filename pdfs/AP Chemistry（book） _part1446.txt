Bond Order
In molecular orbital theory, the stability of a covalent bond is related to its bond order, 
defined as half the difference between the number of bonding electrons and the number 
of antibonding electrons:
  Bond 
order = 1
2 1number of bonding electrons - number of antibonding electrons2 
[9.1]
We take half the difference because we are used to thinking of bonds as pairs of elec-
trons. A bond order of 1 represents a single bond, a bond order of 2 represents a double bond, and 
a bond order of 3 represents a triple bond. Because MO theory also treats molecules contain-
ing an odd number of electrons, bond orders of 1>2, 3>2, or 5>2 are possible.
Let’s now consider the bond order in H
