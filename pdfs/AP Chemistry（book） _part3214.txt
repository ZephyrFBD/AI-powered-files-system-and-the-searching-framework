 a reaction by the expres-
sion ∆G° = -RT ln K (Equation 19.20), we can relate E ° to K by solving Equation 20.12 
for E° and then substituting the Equation 19.20 expression for ∆G°.
 
E° = ∆G°

▲ Figure 20.12 Michael Faraday. Faraday 
(1791–1867) was born in England, a child 
of a poor blacksmith. At the age of 14 he 
was apprenticed to a bookbinder who gave 
him time to read and to attend lectures. In 
1812 he became an assistant in Humphry 
Davy’s laboratory at the Royal Institution. 
He succeeded Davy as the most famous and 
influential scientist in England, making an 
amazing number of important discoveries, 
including his formulation of the quantitative 
relationships between electrical current 
and the extent of chemical reaction in 
electrochemical cells.
