 8.100 The electron affinity of oxygen is -141 kJ>mol, corresponding 
to the reaction
 
 
O1g2 + e- ¡ O-1g2
 
 The lattice energy of K2O1s2 is 2238 kJ>mol. Use these data 
along with data in Appendix C and Figure 7.10 to calculate 
the “second electron affinity” of oxygen, corresponding to 
the reaction
 
 
O-1g2 + e- ¡ O2 -1g2
 8.101 You and a partner are asked to complete a lab entitled 
 
“Oxides of Ruthenium” that is scheduled to extend over two 
lab periods. The first lab, which is to be completed by your 
partner, is devoted to carrying out compositional analysis. 
In the second lab, you are to determine melting points. Upon 
going to lab you find two unlabeled vials, one containing 
a soft yellow substance and the other a black powder. You 
also find the following notes in your partner’s notebook— 
Compound 1: 76.0% Ru and 24.0% O (by mass), Compound 
2: 61.2% Ru and 38.8% O (by mass).  (a) What is the em-
pirical formula for Compound
