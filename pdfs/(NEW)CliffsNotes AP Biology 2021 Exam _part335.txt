site: The tRNA in the middle moves to the third
position (the E site), and the tRNA in the first position (bearing the amino acids) moves to the second position.
7. This leaves the first position binding site empty, allowing for the arrival of a new tRNA.
 
8. Meanwhile, the tRNA in the third position is released, now free to bind with its specific amino acid and provide
another delivery to the mRNA.
9. Elongation continues as each successive tRNA delivers an amino acid. As each new tRNA arrives, the
polypeptide chain is elongated by one new amino acid, growing in sequence and length as prescribed by sequence of
codons on the mRNA.
10. Termination occurs when the ribosome encounters one of the three stop codons. At termination, the completed
polypeptide, the last tRNA, and the two ribosomal subunits are released. The ribosomal subunits can now attach to
the same or another mRNA and repeat the process.
Once the polypeptide is completed, interactions among the amino acids give it its sec
