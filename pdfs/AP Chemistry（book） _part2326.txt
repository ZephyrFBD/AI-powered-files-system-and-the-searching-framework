reaction for initial concentrations of 0.200 M, 0.100 M, 
and 0.050 M NO2.
 14.50 Sucrose 1C12H22O112, commonly known as table sugar, 
reacts in dilute acid solutions to form two simpler sugars, 
glucose and fructose, both of which have the formula 
C6H12O6. At 23 Â°C and in 0.5 M HCl, the following data 
were obtained for the disappearance of sucrose:

 (a) Is the reaction first order or second order with respect to 
3C12H22O114? (b) What is the rate constant? (c) Using this 
rate constant, calculate the concentration of sucrose at 39, 
80, 140, and 210 min if the initial sucrose concentration 
was 0.316 M and the reaction were zero order in sucrose.

 14.51 (a) What factors determine whether a collision between 
two molecules will lead to a chemical reaction? (b) Does 
the rate constant for a reaction generally increase or de-
crease with an increase in reaction te
