▶Practice Exercise 2
Using Table 20.1, rank the following species from the stron-
gest to the weakest reducing agent: I- 1aq), Fe1s2, Al1s2.
NO3
-1aq2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 3 e- ¡ NO1g2 + 2 H2O1l2 
 E°
red = +0.96 V
Ag+1aq2 + e- ¡ Ag1s2  
 
 E°
red = +0.80 V
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + 14 H+1aq2 + 6 e- ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 7 H2O1l2 E°
red = +1.33 V 
Ag+ 6 NO3
- 6 Cr2O7

Sample Exercise 20.8 
Determining Relative Strengths of Oxidizing Agents
Because the standard reduction potential of 
Cr2O7
2- is the most positive, Cr2O7
2- is the stron-
gest oxidizing agent of the three. The rank order is:

20.5 ∣Free Energy and Redox Reactions
We have observed that voltaic cells use spontaneous redox reactions to produce a positive 
cell potential. Given half-cell potentials, we can determine whether a given redox reac-
tion is spontaneous. In this endeavor, we ca
