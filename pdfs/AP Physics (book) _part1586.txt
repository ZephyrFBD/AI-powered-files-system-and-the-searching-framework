librium has been reached, the system has a temperature rise
measured as 0.020 C°. Estimate the bullet’s entering speed.
56. A 310-kg marble boulder rolls off the top of a cliff and 
falls a vertical height of 120 m before striking the ground.
Estimate the temperature rise of the rock if 50% of the
heat generated remains in the rock.
57. A 2.3-kg lead ball is placed in a 2.5-L insulated pail of
water initially at 20.0°C. If the final temperature of the
water–lead combination is 32.0°C, what was the initial
temperature of the lead ball?
58. A microwave oven is used to heat 250 g of water. On its maxi-
mum setting, the oven can raise the temperature of the liquid
water from 20°C to 100°C in 
(a) At
what rate does the oven put energy into the liquid water?
(b) If the power input from the oven to the water remains
constant, determine how many grams of water will boil away
if the oven is operated for 2 min (rather than just 1 min 45 s).
1 min 45 s A= 105 sB.
