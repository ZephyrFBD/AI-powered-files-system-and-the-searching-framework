ei lie along the periphery of the cell, forming swellings visible
through the sarcolemma.
4. Nearly the entire volume of the muscle cell is filled with numerous, long myofibrils. Myofibrils consist of two
types of filaments, as follows (Figure 13-4):
Thin filaments consist of two strands of the globular protein actin arranged in a double helix. Along the length of the
helix are troponin and tropomyosin molecules that cover special binding sites on the actin.
Thick filaments consist of groups of the filamentous protein myosin. Each myosin molecule has a protruding head at
one end. An array of myosin molecules possesses protruding heads at numerous positions along the thick filament.
Within a myofibril, actin and myosin filaments are parallel and arranged side by side. The overlapping filaments
produce a repeating pattern that gives skeletal muscle a striated appearance. Each repeating unit of the pattern, called
a sarcomere, is separated by a border, or Z-line, to which the actin filame
