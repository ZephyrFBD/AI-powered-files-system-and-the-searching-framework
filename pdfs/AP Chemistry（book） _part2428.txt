hese effects in terms of a principle first put forward by 
 
Henri-Louis Le Châtelier* (1850–1936), a French industrial chemist:
If a system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in temperature, pressure,  
or a component concentration, the system will shift its equilibrium position  
so as to counteract the effect of the disturbance.

these numbers into the equilibrium-constant

SECTION 15.7  Le Châtelier’s Principle 
645
In this section, we use Le Châtelier’s principle to make qualitative predictions about 
how a system at equilibrium responds to various changes in external conditions. We 
consider three ways in which a chemical equilibrium can be disturbed: (1) adding or 
removing a reactant or product, (2) changing the pressure by changing the volume, and 
 
(3) changing the tempe
