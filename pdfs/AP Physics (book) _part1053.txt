Hydrometer calibration. A hydrometer is a simple instru-
ment used to measure the specific gravity of a liquid by indicating how deeply
the instrument sinks in the liquid. A particular hydrometer (Fig. 10–16) consists
of a glass tube, weighted at the bottom, which is 25.0 cm long and 
in
cross-sectional area, and has a mass of 45.0 g. How far from the weighted end
