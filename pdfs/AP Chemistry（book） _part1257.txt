.9. You can see that in F2 the distribution is symmetrical, in HF the electron 
density is clearly shifted toward fluorine, and in LiF the shift is even greater. These exam-
ples illustrate, therefore, that the greater the difference in electronegativity between two atoms, 
the more polar their bond.

Sample Exercise 8.4 
Bond Polarity
In each case, which bond is more polar? (a) B¬ Cl or C¬ Cl, (b) P¬ F or P¬ Cl. Indicate in each case which atom has the 
partial negative charge.
