angle of refraction will be 90°, and the refracted ray would skim the surface (ray K).

The incident angle at which this occurs is called the critical angle,
From
Snell’s law,
is given by
(23;6)
For any incident angle less than 
there will be a refracted ray, although part of
the light will also be reflected at the boundary. However, for incident angles 
greater than 
Snell’s law would tell us that 
(
) would be
greater than 1.00 when 
Yet the sine of an angle can never be greater
than 1.00. In this case there is no refracted ray at all, and all of the light is
reflected, as for ray L in Fig. 23–26. Thi
