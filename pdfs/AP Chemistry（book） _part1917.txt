*This movement is analogous to watching people changing seats in a classroom; you can watch 
the people (electrons) move about the seats (atoms), or you can watch the empty seats (holes) 
“move.”
conductivity decreases. When an appropriate voltage is applied, elec-
trons are driven from the conduction band of the n-doped side into 
the junction, where they meet holes that have been driven from the 
valence band of the p-doped side. The electrons fall into the empty 
holes, and their energy is converted into light whose photons have 
energy equal to the band gap (Figure 12.32). In this way electrical en-
ergy is converted into optical energy.
Because the wavelength of light that is emitted depends on the 
band gap of the semiconductor, the color of light produced by the 
LED can be controlled by appropriate 
choice of semiconductor. Most red 
LEDs are made of a mixture of GaP and 
GaAs. The band gap of GaP is 2.26 eV 
13.62 * 10-19 J2, which corresponds 
to a green
