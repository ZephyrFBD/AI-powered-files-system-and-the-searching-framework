 contain multiple carbon–carbon bonds 
(double, triple, or delocalized p bonds). As a result, they contain less hydrogen than 
an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms. Collectively, they are called unsat-
urated hydrocarbons. On the whole, unsaturated molecules are more reactive than sat-
urated ones.
Alkenes
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one C “C bond. The sim-
plest alkene is CH2 “CH2, called ethene (IUPAC) or ethylene (common name), which 
plays important roles as a plant hormone in seed germination and fruit ripening. The 
next member of the series is CH3¬CH“CH2, called propene or propylene. Alkenes 
with four or more carbon atoms have several isomers. For example, the alkene C4H8 
has the four structural isomers shown in Figure 24.7. Notice both their structures and 
their names.
The names of alkenes are based on the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms 
that contains the double bond. The chain is named by changing the ending of the name 
of
