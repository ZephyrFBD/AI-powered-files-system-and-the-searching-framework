gins mitosis in the
diploid state will end mitosis with daughter cells still in the diploid state, each with two identical copies of every
chromosome. However, each of these chromosomes will consist of only one chromatid (one DNA molecule).
During the S phase of interphase, the second DNA molecule is replicated from the first, so that when the next
mitotic division begins, each chromosome will, again, consist of two chromatids.
Meiosis
Meiosis (adjective, meiotic) is very similar to mitosis. Because of the similarity, however, the two processes are
easily confused. The major distinction is that meiosis consists of two groups of divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II
(Figure 7-4). In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair at the metaphase plate, and then the homologues migrate
to opposite poles. In meiosis II, chromosomes spread across the metaphase plate and sister chromatids separate and
migrate to opposite poles. Thus, meiosis II is analogous to mitosis. A summary of each meiotic stage
