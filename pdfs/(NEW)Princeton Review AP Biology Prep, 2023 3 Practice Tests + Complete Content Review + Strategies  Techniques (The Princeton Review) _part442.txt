and a net loss of energy results in loss of mass and,
ultimately, death.
Buildup of Toxins
The downside of food pyramids is that when consumers at the top eat something beneath them, it is like they are
eating that thing AND the thing that thing ate AND and the thing that thing ate, and so on. So, if there is a toxin in
the environment, the consumers at the top are getting the most of it because it becomes more concentrated at each
level.
Toxins in an ecosystem are more concentrated and thus more dangerous for animals further
up the pyramid.
This simply means that if a toxin is introduced into an ecosystem, the animals most likely to be affected are those at
the top of the pyramid. This occurs because of the increasing concentration of such toxins. The classic example of
this phenomenon is DDT, an insecticide initially used to kill mosquitoes. Although the large-scale spraying of DDT
resulted in a decrease in the mosquito population, it also wound up killing off ospreys.
DDT stands for
