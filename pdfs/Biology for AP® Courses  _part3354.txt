However, some stresses, such as illness or injury, can last for a long time. Glycogen reserves, which provide
energy in the short-term response to stress, are exhausted after several hours and cannot meet long-term
energy needs. If glycogen reserves were the only energy source available, neural functioning could not be
maintained once the reserves became depleted due to the nervous systemâ€™s high requirement for glucose.
In this situation, the body has evolved a response to counter long-term stress through the actions of the
glucocorticoids, which ensure that long-term energy requirements can be met. The glucocorticoids mobilize
lipid and protein reserves, stimulate gluconeogenesis, conserve glucose for use by neural tissue, and
stimulate the conservation of salts and water. The mechanisms to maintain homeostasis that are described
here are those observed in the human body. However, the fight-or-flight response exists in some form in all
vertebrates.
