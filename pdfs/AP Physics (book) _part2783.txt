Different types of viewing systems are used in cameras. In some cameras,
you view through a small window just above the lens as in Fig. 25–1. In a
single-lens reflex camera (SLR), you actually view through the lens with the use
of prisms and mirrors (Fig. 25–8). A mirror hangs at a 45° angle behind the lens
and flips up out of the way just before the shutter opens. SLRs have the advan-
tage that you can see almost exactly what you will get. Digital cameras use an LCD
display, and it too can show what you will get on the photo if it is carefully
designed.
