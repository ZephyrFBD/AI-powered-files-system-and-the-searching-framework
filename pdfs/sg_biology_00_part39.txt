the affinity of the antibody for the antigen is greater
than in the primary immune response.
12.
The secondary immune response works poorly against antigens that change greatly over
time; this is not necessarily true for the primary immune response.
13.
The secondary immune response results in the secretion of several immunoglobulins,
including IgM and IgG; the primary immune response results in the secretion of
IgM only.
Note: An accurate, complete, and labeled sketch of a graph showing antibody concentration
(dependent variable) as a function of time-after-antigen-exposure (independent variable), with
accompanying text, will be sufficient to earn three (3) points, viz.,  nos. 1, 5, and 6 above.
