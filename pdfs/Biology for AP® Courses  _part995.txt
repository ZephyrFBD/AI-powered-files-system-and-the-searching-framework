used and justify the prediction.
D. Design an experiment by describing a procedure that
can be used to determine the relationship between light
intensity and efficiency.
50. The classical theory of evolution is based on a gradual
transformation, the accumulation of many random
mutations that are selected. The biological evidence for
evolution is overwhelming, particularly when one
considers what has not changed: core conserved
characteristics.
A. Describe three conserved characteristics common to
both chloroplasts and mitochondria.

Some hypotheses that have been proposed to account for
biological diversity are saltatory, involving sudden
changes, rather than gradualist. In defense of the classical
gradualist theory of evolution, nearly all biologists in the
late 1960s rejected the theory of endosymbiosis as
presented by Lynn Margulis in 1967.
B. Suppose that you want to disprove the theory of
endosymbiosis.
Explain how the following evidence could dispro
