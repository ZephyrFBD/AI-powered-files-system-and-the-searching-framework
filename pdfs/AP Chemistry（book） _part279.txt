 or repulsive forces that act be-
tween either electrically charged or magnetic objects. The magnitude 
of the electric force between two charged particles is given by Coulombâ€™s 
law: F = kQ 1Q 2>d2, where Q 1 and Q 2 are the magnitudes of the charges 
on the two particles, d is the distance between their centers, and k is a 
constant determined by the units for Q and d. 
 (Section 1.4) A 
negative value for the force indicates attraction, whereas a positive 
value indicates repulsion. Electric forces are of primary importance 
in determining the chemical properties of elements.
A Closer look Basic Forces
All nuclei except those of hydrogen atoms contain two or 
more protons. Because like charges repel, electrical repulsion 
would cause the protons to fly apart if the strong nuclear force 
did not keep them together. As the name implies, this force 
can be quite strong but only when particles are extremely close 
together, as are the protons and neutrons in a nucleus. At this 
distance
