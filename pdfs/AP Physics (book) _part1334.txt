it makes and its disturbance of the air form into a shock wave con-
taining a tremendous amount of sound energy.When the shock wave passes a listener,
it is heard as a loud sonic boom.A sonic boom lasts only a fraction of a second, but the
energy it contains is sometimes sufficient to break windows and cause other damage.
Actually, a sonic boom is made up of two or more booms since major shock waves
can form at the front and the rear of the aircraft (Fig.12–25), as well as at the wings
and other parts. Bow waves of a boat are also multiple, as can be seen in Fig.12–24a.
When an aircraft accelerates toward the speed of sound, it encounters a barrier
of sound waves in front of it (see Fig. 12–23c). To exceed the speed of sound, the
aircraft needs extra thrust to pass through this sound barrier. This is called
“breaking the sound barrier.” Once a supersonic speed is attained, this barrier no
longer impedes the motion. It is sometimes erroneously thought that a sonic boom
is produced only
