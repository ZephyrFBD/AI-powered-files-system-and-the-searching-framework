The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells.
Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth,
DNA replication, and division that produces two identical (clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and
the mitotic phase (Figure 10.5). During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the mitotic phase, the
replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.
