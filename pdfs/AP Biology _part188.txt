hoice D is incorrect because ΔG is the difference
between the PE of the reactants and the PE of the products. It is not
affected by the absence or presence of enzymes. (ENE-1)
(B) G and H inhibit the reactions that produce E and F from D, which
means that no G and H will be produced. D inhibits the production
of B. The only product that is not inhibited when all others are is C.
(SP 4)
(A) Enzymes function as they do because of their unique shape or
conformation, which results from their makeup: primary, secondary,
and tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain. The bond between an
enzyme and its substrate at the active site is a weak one and is only
temporary. It consists of Van der Waal and electrostatic forces and
hydrogen bonding. The current model for how substrates and
enzymes bind is not lock and key; rather, it is “induced-fit” because
