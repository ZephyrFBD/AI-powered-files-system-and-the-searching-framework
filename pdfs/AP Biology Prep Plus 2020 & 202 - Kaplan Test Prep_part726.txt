fically selected for
running capacity and not multiple other traits. (C) is incorrect because
some of the characteristics, such as body weight and susceptibility to
heart failure, are distinct phenotypes. (D) is incorrect because the
researchers were selecting for running ability, not reduced fitness.

A consistent change in a specific direction across multiple generations
suggests the existence of a selective pressure, which is making
members of the species with the dominant trait fitter than those who
lack the trait. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because random
variation is equally likely to cause changes in any direction; three
generations of changes in the same direction suggests something
other than randomness. (C) is incorrect because it would be unlikely to
see large numbers of mutations that happened to result in a higher

populations are heavily aï¬€ecte
