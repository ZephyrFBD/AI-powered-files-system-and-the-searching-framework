diabat-
ically, performing 8300 J of work in the process. What is the
change in temperature of the gas during this expansion?
10. (II) Consider the following two-step process. Heat is allowed
to flow out of an ideal gas at constant volume so that its pres-
sure drops from 2.2 atm to 1.4 atm. Then the gas expands at
constant pressure, from a volume of 5.9 L to 9.3 L, where the
temperature reaches its original value. See Fig.15–22. Calculate
(a) the total work done by the gas in the process, (b) the
change in internal
energy of the gas in
the process, and
(c) the total heat
flow into or out of
the gas.

11. (II) Use the conservation of energy to explain why the 
temperature of a well-insulated gas increases when it is
compressed—say, by pushing down on a piston—whereas
the temperature decreases when the gas expands.
