 chemical reactions, and this
change is referred to as ∆G.
The ∆G of a reaction can be negative or positive, meaning that the reaction releases energy or consumes energy,
respectively. A reaction with a negative ∆G that gives off energy is called an exergonic reaction. One with a positive ∆G
that requires energy input is called an endergonic reaction. Exergonic reactions are said to be spontaneous, because their
products have less energy than their reactants. The products of endergonic reactions have a higher energy state than the
reactants, and so these are nonspontaneous reactions. However, all reactions (including spontaneous –∆G reactions)
require an initial input of energy in order to reach the transition state, at which they’ll proceed. This initial input of energy
is called the activation energy.
6.3 The Laws of Thermodynamics
In studying energy, scientists use the term “system” to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers.
