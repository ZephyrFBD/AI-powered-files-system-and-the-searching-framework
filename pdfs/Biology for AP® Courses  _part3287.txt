52. Explain how being on the moon, which has less gravity
than Earth, might affect vestibular sensation and why.
a.
Vestibular sensation relies on gravity’s effects on
tiny crystals in the inner nostril; therefore,
reduced gravity on the moon would likely impair
vestibular sensation.
b.
Vestibular sensation relies on gravity’s effects on
huge crystals in the inner ear; therefore, reduced
gravity on the moon would likely impair
vestibular sensation.
c.
Vestibular sensation relies on gravity’s effects on
tiny crystals in the inner ear; therefore, reduced
gravity on the moon would likely impair
vestibular sensation.
d.
Vestibular sensation relies on gravity’s effects on
tiny crystals in the outer ear; therefore, reduced
gravity on t
