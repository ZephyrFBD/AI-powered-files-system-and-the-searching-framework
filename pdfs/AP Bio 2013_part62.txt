53. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is a recessive  
genetic disorder that includes the characteristics 
of short stature and extra fingers or toes. In the 
general population, this syndrome occurs in 
approximately 1 in 150,000 live births. In a 
particular isolated population, however, the 
incidence of this syndrome among live births  
is 1 in 500. 
  Assume that both the isolated population and  
the general population are in Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium with respect to this syndrome. Which 
of the following best describes the difference 
between the frequency of the allele that causes  
the syndrome in the general population and the 
frequency of the allele in the isolated population? 
(A) The frequency of the Ellis-van Creveld allele 
is 0.002 in the isolated population and 
0.0000066 in the general population,  
which suggests that selection for this trait  
is occurring in both populations. 
(B) The frequency of the Ellis-van Creveld allele 
is 0.0447
