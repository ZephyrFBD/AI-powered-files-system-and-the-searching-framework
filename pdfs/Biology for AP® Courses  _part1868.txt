lled a donor),
it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring
a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.
The first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was
very low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.7). There is speculation that because
the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual.
Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often
exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of
embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells
