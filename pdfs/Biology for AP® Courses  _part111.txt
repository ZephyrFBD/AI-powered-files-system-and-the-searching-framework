 conditions and are called
extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on
morphology (shape).
Woese’s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed,
present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged
throughout evolution). Woese’s approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are
insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous
biochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 1.18). The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA
sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes,
and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.
Figure 1.18 These images represent different domains. The (a) bacteria in this micrograph belong to Domain
Bacteria, while the
