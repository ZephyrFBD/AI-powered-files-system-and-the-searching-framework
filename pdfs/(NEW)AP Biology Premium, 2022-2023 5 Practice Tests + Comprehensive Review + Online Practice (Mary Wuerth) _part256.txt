e cytoplasm, along with all of its cellular contents, between the two daughter cells.
Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis. During cytokinesis in animal cells, a cleavage furrow is formed, which partitions
the cytosol and its contents between the two new cells. Plant cells have a cell wall and accomplish cytokinesis
differently. In plant cells, a cell plate is built within the dividing cell, providing new cell wall material for each
daughter cell.
Nondividing Cells
Some cells may stop dividing either temporarily or permanently. Cells may stop dividing when they reach their
mature, fully differentiated state or when environmental conditions are not favorable for continued growth. These
nondividing cells have exited the cell cycle and are in G0. Cells may enter G0 at any point in the cell cycle and may
reenter the cell cycle if stimulated to do so by appropriate molecular signals.

Proper regulation of the cell cycle is critical to appropria
