s of times more
energy than novae, up to 
times more luminous than our Sun. The peak of
brightness may exceed that of the entire galaxy in which they are located, but lasts
only a few days or weeks. They slowly fade over a few months. Many supernovae
form by core collapse to a neutron star as described above. See Fig. 33–9.
Type Ia supernovae are different. They all seem to have very nearly the same
luminosity. They are believed to be binary stars, one of which is a white dwarf
that pulls mass from its companion, much like for a nova, Fig. 33–10. The mass is
higher, and as mass is captured and the total mass approaches the Chandrasekhar
limit of 1.4 solar masses, it explodes as a “white-dwarf” supernova by undergoing
a “thermonuclear runaway”—an uncontrolled chain of nuclear reactions that
entirely destroys the white dwarf. Type Ia supernovae are useful to us as
“standard candles”in the night sky to help us determine distance—see next Section.
