35. (I) A fisherman notices that wave crests pass the bow of
his anchored boat every 3.0 s. He measures the distance
between two crests to be 7.0 m. How fast are the waves
traveling?
36. (I) A sound wave in air has a frequency of 282 Hz and 
travels with a speed of 
How far apart are the wave
crests (compressions)?
37. (I) Calculate the speed of longitudinal waves in (a) water,
(b) granite, and (c) steel.
38. (I) AM radio signals have frequencies between 550 kHz
and 1600 kHz (kilohertz) and travel with a speed of
What are the wavelengths of these signals?
On FM the frequencies range from 88 MHz to 108 MHz
(megahertz) and travel at the same speed. What are their
wavelengths?
39. (II) P and S waves from an earthquake travel at different
speeds, and this difference helps locate the earthquake
