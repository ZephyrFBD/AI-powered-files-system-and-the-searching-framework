 23.96  A palladium complex formed from a solution containing 
bromide ion and pyridine, C5H5N (a good electron-pair 
donor), is found on elemental analysis to contain 37.6% 
bromine, 28.3% carbon, 6.60% nitrogen, and 2.37% 
hydrogen by mass. The compound is slightly soluble in 
several organic solvents; its solutions in water or alcohol do 
not conduct electricity. It is found experimentally to have 
a zero dipole moment. Write the chemical formula, and 
indicate its probable structure.
 23.97  (a) In early studies it was observed that when the complex 
3Co(NH3)4Br24Br was placed in water, the electrical conduc-
tivity of a 0.05 M solution changed from an initial value of 
191 ohm-1 to a final value of 374 ohm-1 over a period of an 
hour or so. Suggest an explanation for the observed results. 
(See Exercise 23.69 for relevant comparison data.) (b) Write 
a balanced chemical equation to describe the reaction.
