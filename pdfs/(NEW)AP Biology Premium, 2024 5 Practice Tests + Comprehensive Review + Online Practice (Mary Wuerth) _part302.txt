of offspring with purple flowers
is  and the probability of offspring with white flowers is .
Also recall from the monohybrid cross of Tt Ã— Tt (Figure 13.2) that the probability of tall offspring is  and the
probability of short offspring is .
So the probability of this cross producing a plant that is tall and has purple flowers is the product of the
probability of producing a tall plant 
 times the probability of producing a plant with purple flowers 
. The result
is 
.
Using the same process, the probability of this cross producing a tall plant with white flowers is the product of
the probability of producing a tall plant 
 times the probability of producing a plant with white flowers 
. The
result is 
.
Similarly, the probability of this cross producing a short plant with purple flowers is the product of the
probability of producing a short plant 
 times the probability of producing a plant with purple flowers 
. The
result is 
.
Finally, the probability of this cross producing a sh
