 available, including Google Sheets, to complete the first 
section of your investigation. 
In the second part of the investigation, you will use more sophisticated spreadsheet 
models or computer models to explore various aspects of evolution and alleles in 
populations. To understand how these complex tools work and their limitations, you 
first need to build a model of your own.

Building a Simple Mathematical Model 
The real world is infinitely complicated. To penetrate that complexity using model 
building, you must learn to make reasonable, simplifying assumptions about complex 
processes. For example, climate change models or weather forecasting models are 
simplifications of very complex processes â€” more than can be accounted for with 
even the most powerful computer. These models allow us to make predictions and test 
hypotheses about climate change and weather. 
By definition, any model is a simplification
