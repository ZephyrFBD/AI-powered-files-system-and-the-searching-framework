m an overproduction of parathyroid hormone. This results in excessive calcium being
removed from bones and introduced into blood circulation, producing structural weakness of the bones, which can lead
to deformation and fractures, plus nervous system impairment due to high blood calcium levels. Hypoparathyroidism, the
underproduction of PTH, results in extremely low levels of blood calcium, which causes impaired muscle function and may
result in tetany (severe sustained muscle contraction).
The hormone calcitonin, which is produced by the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid, has the opposite effect on blood

calcium levels as does PTH. Calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts, stimulating osteoblasts,
and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys. This results in calcium being added to the bones to promote structural
integrity. Calcito
