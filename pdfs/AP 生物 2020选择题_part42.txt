heromone when their skin cells are 
damaged. Researchers placed pike, a predator of 
fathead minnows, in a choice chamber and 
released the minnow pheromone at one end of 
the chamber. The researchers observed that the 
pike oriented themselves toward the end of the 
chamber where the pheromone was released. 
Which of the following questions will best guide 
a follow-up investigation about the role of 
pheromones in locating prey? 
(A) How do pike determine that the fathead 
minnow pheromone is present in the 
water? 
(B) Why do pike prey on fathead minnows? 
(C) Do pike have natural predators in the 
environment? 
(D) Do pike release pheromones that are 
detected by fathead minnows? 
46. Which of the following best explains why a 
cellâ€™s plasma membrane is composed of two 
layers of phospholipids rather than just a single 
layer? 
(A) Having two oppositely oriented layers of 
phospholipids allows only the hydrophilic 
heads to interact with water inside and 
outside of the cell. 
(B)
