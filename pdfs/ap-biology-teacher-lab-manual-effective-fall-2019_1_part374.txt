a sun-grown 
leaf? In this situation, sun versus shade is the second variable. Comparing light 
response curves is a standard research technique in plant physiological ecology. 
2. When you compare the ET50 across treatments, you will discover that there is an 
inverse relationship between ET50 and the rate of photosynthesis — ET50 goes down 
as rate of photosynthesis goes up, which plots a graph with a negative slope. This 
creates a seemingly backward graph when plotting your ET50 data across treatments, 
as shown in Figure 8a. To correct this representation and make a graph that 
shows increasing rates of photosynthesis with a positive slope, the ET50 term can 
be modified by taking its inverse, or 1/ET50. This creates a more traditional direct 
relationship graph, as shown in Figure 8b.
