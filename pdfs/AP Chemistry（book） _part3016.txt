te function, its value is the same regardless 
of whether the process is reversible or irreversible. Earlier (just before Sample Exercise 19.2) 
 
we calculated the entropy change of this system:
 
∆Ssys =
qrev
T
=
11 mol216.01 * 103 J>mol2
273 K
= 22.0 J>K 
The portion of the surroundings immediately in contact with the ice is your palm, which 
we assume is at body temperature, 37  °C = 310 K. We will use this as the temperature of 
the surroundings. The quantity of heat lost by your palm is -6.01 * 103 J>mol, which is 
equal in magnitude to the quantity of heat gained by the ice but has the opposite sign. 
Hence, the entropy change of the surroundings is
 
∆Ssurr =
qrev
T
=
11 mol21-6.01 * 103 J>mol2
310 K
= -19.4 J>K 
We can consider that everything in the universe consists of the system of inter-
est and its surroundings. Therefore, ∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr. Thus, the overall entropy 
change of the universe is positive in our example:
 
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr = 122.0 J>K2 + 1-19.4
