 in a sol-
vent system form colloids, or colloidal dispersions. Colloids, which are 
intermediate between solutions and heterogeneous mixtures, have 
many practical applications. One useful physical property of colloids, 
the scattering of visible light, is referred to as the Tyndall effect. Aque-
ous colloids are classified as hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Hydrophilic 
colloids are common in living organisms, in which large molecular 
aggregates (enzymes, antibodies) remain suspended because they 
have many polar, or charged, atomic groups on their surfaces that 
interact with water. Hydrophobic colloids, such as small droplets of 
oil, may remain in suspension through adsorption of charged parti-
cles on their surfaces.
Colloids undergo Brownian motion in liquids, analogous to the 
random three-dimensional motion of gas molecules.
