ugh an electron transport chain, then back to the
same reaction center again (see figure below). The reaction center in
photosystem I includes a chlorophyll called P700 because its maximal
light absorbance occurs at 700 nm. This process does not produce oxygen
and does not produce NADPH.
Noncyclic photophosphorylation starts in photosystem II (see figure on
the following page). In noncyclic photophosphorylation, chlorophyll
pigment absorbs light and passes excited electrons to a reaction center, a
process equivalent to cyclic photophosphorylation. The photosystem II
reaction center contains a P680 chlorophyll, distinct from photosystem I.
From the photosystem II reaction center, the electrons are passed to an
electron transport chain. In this case, however, the electrons are not
returned to the reaction center at the end of the electron transport chain
but are passed to photosystem I. Photosystem II replaces the electrons it
lost by getting them from water, producing oxygen in the proc
