necessary to synthesize the amino acid tryptophan; see Figures 9.10 and
9.11. As long as RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, one long strand
of mRNA containing start and stop codons is transcribed. If adequate
tryptophan is present, tryptophan itself acts as a corepressor activating the
repressor. The activated repressor binds to the operator, preventing RNA
polymerase from binding to the promoter. Without RNA polymerase
attached to DNA at the promoter, transcription ceases. The tryptophan
operon is known as a repressible operon, meaning it is always switched on
unless the repressor is activated.
