) in the genetic code.
The ribosome performs protein synthesis. Once an mRNA enters the
cytoplasm, several ribosomes attach to it, creating multiple lengths of the
protein simultaneously. Elongation continues until a stop codon is
reached and the ribosome disengages the mRNA. The newly synthesized
polypeptide usually undergoes transformation (i.e., removal of terminal
amino acids) before achieving its active state.

AP EXPERT NOTE
You do not need to memorize the genetic code, codons, or the
structure of the 20 amino acids for the AP Biology exam. 
STAGES OF TRANSLATION
Initiation
The first stage of translation is initiation. During this stage, the mRNA
attaches itself to the ribosome. The first codon on the mRNA is always
AUG (the start sequence), which codes for the amino acid methionine.
tRNA brings the first amino acid and places it in its proper place.
Elongation
Subsequent amino ac
