FIGURE 25–23 Terrestrial
telescopes that produce an upright
image: (a) Galilean; (b) spyglass, or
erector type.
A terrestrial telescope, for viewing objects on Earth, must provide an upright
image—seeing normal objects upside down would be difficult (much less important
for viewing stars). Two designs are shown in Fig. 25–23. The Galilean type, which
Galileo used for his great astronomical discoveries, has a diverging lens as eye-
piece which intercepts the converging rays from the objective lens before they reach
a focus, and acts to form a virtual upright image, Fig. 25–23a. This design is still
used in opera glasses. The tube is reasonably short, but
