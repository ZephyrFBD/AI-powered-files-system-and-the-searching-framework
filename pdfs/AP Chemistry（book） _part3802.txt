The differences in the electronegativity values of C (2.5) and O (3.5) and of O and H (2.1) 
indicate that the C ¬O and O ¬H bonds are quite polar. Thus, many reactions of etha-
nol involve these bonds while the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule remains intact. 
A group of atoms such as the C ¬O ¬H group, which determines how an organic mole-
cule reacts (in other words, how the molecule functions), is called a functional group. 
The functional group is the center of reactivity in an organic molecule.
Give It Some Thought
Which bond is most likely to be the location of a chemical reaction: C “ N, C ¬ C, 
or C ¬ H?
solubility and Acid–Base Properties of Organic Compounds
In most organic substances, the most prevalent bonds are carbon–carbon and carbon–
hydrogen, which are not polar. For this reason, the overall polarity of organic molecules 
is often low, which makes them generally soluble in nonpolar solvents and not very sol-
uble in water.
