(a) The molecule is nonplanar. (b) Allene has no dipole moment.  
(c) The bonding in allene would not be described as delocalized. The 
p electron clouds of the two adjacent C “ C are mutually perpen-
dicular, so there is no overlap and no delocalization of p electrons.  
9.101 (a) All O atoms have sp2 hybridization. (b) The two s bonds 
are formed by overlap of sp2 hybrid orbitals, the p bond is formed 
by overlap of atomic p orbitals, one nonbonded pair is in a p atomic 
orbital and the other ﬁve nonbonded pairs are i
