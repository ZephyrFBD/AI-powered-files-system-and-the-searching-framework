d represent one data point or a mean of values. If mean values are plotted, standard deviation or
standard error can also be shown. More generally, line graphs can also be used to compare the way in which a
dependent variable (y-axis) changes in relation to an independent variable (x-axis).
When making line graphs, the intervals on the axes must be consistent. Also make sure it is clear whether the data
starts at the origin (0, 0) or not. The same guidelines apply to scatterplots, which will be discussed below.
Data points should be connected with a solid line. You can extrapolate (extend) the line past the data points, but then
you must use a broken line. Finally, the slope on a line graph tells you the rate of change.
Suppose we want to determine how stress hormone levels change after the end of an important exam. If we measure
cortisol and epinephrine in the serum of several people every hour for five hours after the end of an exam, we would
have several values for each time point.
