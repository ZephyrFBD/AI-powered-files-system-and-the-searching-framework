ets of chromosomes in each future nucleus—has been reduced from two to one. For this reason,
meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division. There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.
Meiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line
up on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase
II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid—now referred to as a chromosome—is pulled
to one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been
crossover, the two products of each individual meiosis II division would be identical (like in mitosis). Instead, they are
different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division
because although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting
