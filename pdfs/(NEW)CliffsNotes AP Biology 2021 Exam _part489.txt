is horizontal, auxin is produced at the apical meristem (root tip). The obvious hypothesis is that the auxin
moves away from the root tips, and, as in stems, concentrates on the lower side of the root. But in order for roots to
bend down, auxin must inhibit growth. Perhaps the concentration or sensitivity to auxin is different in roots than it is
in shoots. Additional research is necessary to provide a more complete explanation of gravitropism in roots.
3. Thigmotropism is a response to touch. When vines and other climbing plants come in contact with some object,
they respond by wrapping around it. Although auxin seems to be involved, the mechanism for this kind of
differential growth is not well understood.
4. Dormancy is a plant mechanism in response to conditions that are unfavorable:
 
Abscission is the loss of leaves or other plant parts. For many plants, the winter presents unfavorable conditions of
cold temperatures, low light intensity, and drought (water in the form of snow is
