hand pushes a cart and pulls a wagon,
a bat hits a ball, and so on. But gravity acts without contact, said Newton: the Earth
exerts a force on a falling apple and on the Moon, even though there is no contact,
and the two objects may even be very far apart.†
Newton set about determining the magnitude of the gravitational force that
the Earth exerts on the Moon as compared to the gravitational force on objects
at the Earth’s surface. The centripetal acceleration of the Moon, as we calculated
in Example 5–2, is
In terms of the acceleration of gravity at
the Earth’s surface,
That is, the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth is about 
as great as 
the acceleration of objects at the Earth’s surface. The Moon is 384,000 km from
the Earth, which is about 60 times the Earth’s radius of 6380 km. That is, the
Moon is 60 times farther from the Earth’s center than are objects at the Earth’s
surface. But  
Again that number 3600! Newton concluded
that the gravitational force 
or 
exerted by the
