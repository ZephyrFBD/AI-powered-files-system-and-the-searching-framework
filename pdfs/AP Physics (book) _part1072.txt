 
top of the vertical tube of a perfume atomizer (Fig. 10–24a) is less than the normal
air pressure acting on the surface of the liquid in the bowl. Thus atmospheric
pressure in the bowl pushes the perfume up the tube because of the lower pres-
sure at the top. A Ping-Pong ball can be made to float above a blowing jet of air
(a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner that can also blow air), Fig. 10–24b; if the ball
begins to leave the jet of air, the higher pressure in the still air outside the jet
pushes the ball back in.

Airplane Wings and Dynamic Lift
Airplanes experience a “lift” force on their wings, keeping them up in the air, if
they are moving at a sufficiently high speed relative to the air and the wing is
tilted upward at a small angle (the “attack angle”). See Fig. 10–25, where stream-
lines of air are shown rushing
