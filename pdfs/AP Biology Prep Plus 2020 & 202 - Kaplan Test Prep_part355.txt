n only work so fast. This
maximum reaction rate is termed Vmax and is illustrated in the following
graph as the flat part of the rate versus substrate concentration curve for
an enzymatic reaction. This point occurs when the enzymes become
saturated with substrate. Enzymes become saturated at high substrate
concentrations because substrate must bind to enzymes at a particular
place: the active site. While the entire process is somewhat complex, the
main idea is that increasing the substrate can produce the same Vmax if
competitive inhibitors are present, but noncompetitive inhibitors lower
Vmax regardless of the amount of substrate.
Temperature- and pH-Dependent Enzyme
Reaction Rates
Increasing the concentration of the enzyme itself will also speed up the
rate of the reaction. However, note that the synthesis of enzymes requires
energy and resources that could be deployed elsewhere in an organism,
so there is a trade-oﬀ to producing more copies of a particular enzyme.
