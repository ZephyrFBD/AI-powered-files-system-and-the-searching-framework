effect will increasing the volume of the system have on the 
mole fraction of Cl2 in the equilibrium mixture? (d) The 
reaction is exothermic. What effect will increasing the tem-
perature of the system have on the mole fraction of Cl2 in 
the equilibrium mixture?
 [15.91] An equilibrium mixture of H2, I2, and HI at 458 °C con-
tains 0.112 mol H2, 0.112 mol I2, and 0.775 mol HI in a 
5.00-L vessel. What are the equilibrium partial pressures 
when equilibrium is reestablished following the addition 
of 0.200 mol of HI?
 [15.92] Consider the hypothetical reaction A1g2 + 2 B1g2 ∆ 
2 C1g2, for which Kc = 0.25 at a certain temperature. A 
1.00-L reaction vessel is loaded with 1.00 mol of com-
pound C, which is allowed to reach equilibrium. Let the 
variable x represent the number of mol>L of compound 
A present at equilibrium. (a) In terms of x, what are the 
equilibrium concentrations of compounds B and C?
