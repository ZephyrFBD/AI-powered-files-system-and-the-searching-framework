Exercise 2B:
Case Studies
CASE 1—A Test of Ideal Hardy-Weinberg
Interpretation of this Exercise
A population that is in an Ideal Hardy-Weinberg would be a population of heterozygote individuals
that follow all 5 key Hardy-Weinberg criteria:
•
No mutation
•
No gene flow or genetic variation
•
A very large population sample
•
No natural selection
•
Random mating
Frequency of p and q = 0.5
Percent of p2 = 25%
Percent of 2pq = 50%
Percent of q2 = 25%
CASE 2—Comparison to Hardy-Weinberg
Interpretation of this Exercise
If this population is random with no known restrictions on the population, can this population be in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
•
Frequency of p = 0.26 and q = 0.74
•
Percent of p2 = 10%
•
Percent of 2pq = 35%
•
Percent of q2 = 55%
Yes, it’s possible for this population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, even though the above
calculations don’t support this conclusion. The reason is that the population sampled is to
