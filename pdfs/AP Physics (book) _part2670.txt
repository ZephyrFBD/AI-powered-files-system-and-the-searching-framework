ACH We use
to calculate the angular positions of the
blue maximum and the 
red one.
SOLUTION The grating spacing is
The blue
of the third order occurs at an angle given by
Red in second order occurs at
which is a greater angle; so the second order overlaps into the beginning of the
third-order spectrum.
