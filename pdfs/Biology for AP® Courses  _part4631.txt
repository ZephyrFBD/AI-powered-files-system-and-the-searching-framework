4.15 The student is able to use visual representations to analyze situations or solve
problems qualitatively to illustrate how interactions among living systems and with their
environment result in the movement of matter and energy.
All living things require energy in one form or another. Energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often
in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller
compounds, and life itself is an energy-driven process. Living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules
(proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input.
It is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to
another through
