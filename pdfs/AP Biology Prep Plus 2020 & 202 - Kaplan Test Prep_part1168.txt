because while geographic isolation can cause speciation, it’s not proof of
speciation. (D) is incorrect because aggression and predation are not

The molecular clock hypothesis states that random genetic mutations
occur at a constant rate and will steadily accumulate over time. Thus, if
two species share many of the same genetic mutations, they must have a
more recent common ancestor. (D) correctly concludes that the more
similar the genetic mutations, the more recently they diverged from a
common ancestor. (A) and (B) are incorrect because there’s insuﬀicient
evidence to determine whether species B or D was a common ancestor for
the other. (C) is incorrect because without data from the other three
species, you can’t determine whether or not species B or D was a common

According to Darwin’s theory of evolution, organisms are said to be of
diﬀerent species when the diﬀerences in their behavior, environment,
