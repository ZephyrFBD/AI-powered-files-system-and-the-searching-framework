 chromosomes again condense and become visible.
■During metaphase II, chromosomes line up in a single line along the center of each cell, similar to how
chromosomes line up in the metaphase stage of mitosis.
■Then, in anaphase II, sister chromatids separate and move to opposite ends of the cell. Each sister chromatid
will have its own centromere once this separation has occurred. At the end of anaphase II, these separated
sister chromatids are now considered separate chromosomes.
■Telophase II then splits each of the two cells in half, resulting in four cells. At the end of meiosis II, there are
four haploid gametic cells, as shown in Figure 12.2.
Figure 12.2 Meiosis II
The process of meiosis results in gametes with the haploid number of chromosomes. This is important because
the joining of two haploid gametes in fertilization produces a diploid zygote. Together, meiosis and fertilization
ensure consistency in the number of chromosomes from one generation to the next.
