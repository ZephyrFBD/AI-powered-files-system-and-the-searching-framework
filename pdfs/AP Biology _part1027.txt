o do with translation. Choice C is
incorrect because exons are transcribed and translated; they are not
replaced with intervening sequences (introns).
(D) Acid rain is caused by the accumulation of sulfuric, sulfurous,
nitric, and nitrous acids in the air from the burning of fossil fuels. A
pH of 6.0 is 100 times more acidic than a pH of 8.0. The hydrogen
ion concentration of a pH of 6.0 is equal to 1 × 10–6 M.
(B) Without the signal from the gonads to develop into a male, the
rabbit remains a female.
(C) The testosterone would send the signal that the male gonad
would have sent. Both the male and female embryos would develop
testes.
(D) The point of meiosis is variation. Daughter cells are different
from the parent cells and are different from each other. Homologues
pair during prophase I, not prophase II. DNA replication occurs
before meiosis I only.
(C) Pioneer organisms, like lichens, colonize an area that is not
habitable by other organisms and alter it over time in a way that
