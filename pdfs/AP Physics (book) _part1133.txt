force wind of 
blows across the 
face of a storefront window. Estimate the force on the
window due to the difference in air pres-
sure inside and outside the window. Assume the store is
airtight so the inside pressure remains at 1.0 atm. (This is
why you should not tightly seal a building in preparation
for a hurricane.)

3. In working out his principle, Pascal showed dramatically
how force can be multiplied with fluid pressure. He placed
a long, thin tube of radius
vertically into a
wine barrel of radius 
Fig. 10–62. He found
that when the barrel was filled
with water and the tube filled to a
height of 12 m, the barrel burst.
Calculate (a) the mass of water in
the tube, and (b) the net force
exerted by the water in the barrel
on the lid just before rupture.

A: (d).
B: The same. Pressure depends on depth, not on length.
