h the pressure 
of the gas exceeds atmospheric pressure. Because an open-end 
mercury manometer is used, the height difference directly mea-
sures the pressure difference in mm Hg or torr between the gas 
and the atmosphere.

The Gas Laws

Boyle’s law occupies a special place in the history of science because Boyle was the 
first to carry out experiments in which one variable was systematically changed to deter-
mine the effect on another variable. The data from the experiments were then employed 
to establish an empirical relationship—a “law.”
We apply Boyle’s law every time we breathe. The rib cage, which can expand and 
contract, and the diaphragm, a muscle beneath the lungs, govern the volume of 
the lungs. Inhalation occurs when the rib cage expands and the diaphragm moves 
 
downward. Both actions increase the volume of the lungs, thus decreasing the gas 
pressure inside the lungs. Atmospheric pressure then forces air into the lungs until the 
 
pressure in t
