 respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)
Despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules
called a “9 + 2 array.” This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule
doublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26).
Figure 4.26 This transmission electron micrograph of two flagella shows the 9 + 2 array of microtubules: nine
microtubule doublets surround a single microtubule doublet. (credit: modification of work by Dartmouth Electron

The ribosomes in bacterial cells and in human cells are made up of proteins and ribosomal RNA, suggesting that both
kinds of cells share a common ancestor cell type. W
