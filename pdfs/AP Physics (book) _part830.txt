 its mass, but also on how that mass is distributed 
with respect to the axis. For example, a large-diameter cylinder will have greater
rotational inertia than one of equal mass but smaller diameter, Fig. 8–18. The
former will be harder to start rotating, and harder to stop. When the mass is 
concentrated farther from the axis of rotation, the rotational inertia is greater. For
rotational motion, the mass of an object can not be considered as concentrated 
at its center of mass.
T
wo weights on a bar: different axis, different I. Two
small “weights,” of mass 5.0 kg and 7.0 kg, are mounted 4.0 m apart on a light
rod (whose mass can be ignored), as shown in Fig. 8–19. Calculate the moment
of inertia of the system (a) when rotated about an axis halfway between the
weights, Fig. 8–19a, and (b) when rotated about an axis 0.50 m to the left of the
5.0-kg mass (Fig. 8–19b).
APPROACH In each case, the moment of inertia of the system is found by 
summing over the two parts using Eq. 8–13.
