3.3 The student is able to describe representations and models that illustrate how genetic
information is copied for transmission between generations.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:

DNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the
mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in
approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions.
This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is quite rapid and occurs without many
mistakes.
DNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, e
