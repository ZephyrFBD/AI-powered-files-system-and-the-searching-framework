 is an endergonic process, in which the products have
more free energy than the reactants. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because not all of the solar energy is transformed; some of the energy
is lost as heat. (B) is incorrect because the solar energy is also
converted into mechanical energy in the movements of paramecia and
amoebae. (D) is incorrect because photosynthesis is not exergonic.

Activating enzymes that break down starch into simple sugars would
enhance fermentation by the yeast. Therefore,Â (C) is correct. (A) and
(B) are incorrect because the yeast are only capable of fermenting
simple sugars, not starch, so neither experimental treatment would
lead to much fermentation. (D) is incorrect because germinating
seedlings would only deplete starch reserves, leaving even fewer
carbohydrates available for fermentation.

The conditions of the experiment create an artificial H+ gradient across
the thylakoid membranes.
