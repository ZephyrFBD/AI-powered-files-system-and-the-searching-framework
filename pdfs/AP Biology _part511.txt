most productive terrestrial ecosystems and contribute a large portion of
Earthâ€™s overall net primary production. (Unfortunately, that number is
shrinking as we cut down rainforests to make way for farming.) Coral
reefs, on the other hand, have a very high NPP but contribute relatively
little to the global NPP because they occupy such a tiny part of the planet.
The open oceans are just the opposite of coral reefs. Their NPP is very low
per unit area. Because they occupy three-fourths of the globe, however,
their contribution to the global NPP is higher than that of any other biome.

ENERGY FLOW AND THE FOOD CHAIN
The food chain is the pathway along which food is transferred from one
trophic or feeding level to another. Energy, in the form of food, moves
from the producers to the herbivores to the carnivores. Only about 10
percent of the energy stored in any trophic level is co
