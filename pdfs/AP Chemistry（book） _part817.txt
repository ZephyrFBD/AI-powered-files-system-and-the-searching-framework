rd states. The standard 
state of a substance is its pure, most stable form at 1 atm and the 
temperature of interest (usually 298 K). Thus, the standard en-
thalpy change of a reaction, ∆H°, is the enthalpy change when all 
reactants and products are in their standard states. The standard 
enthalpy of formation, ∆Hf°, of a substance is the change in en-
thalpy for the reaction that forms one mole of the substance from 
its elements in their standard states. For any element in its stan-
dard state, ∆Hf° = 0.

The standard enthalpy change for any reaction can be readily 
calculated from the standard enthalpies of formation of the reac-
tants and products in the reaction:

BOND ENTHALPIES (SECTION 5.8) The strength of a covalent 
bond is measured by its bond enthalpy, which is the molar enthalpy 
change required to break a particular bond. Average bond enthalpies 
can be determined for a wide variety of covalent bonds.
