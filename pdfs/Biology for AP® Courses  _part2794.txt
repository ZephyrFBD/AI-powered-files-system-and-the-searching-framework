atmospheric concentrations of the distant, as well as the
recent, past. Life must adapt to changes in the
environment. Woodward examined samples from the
Cambridge herbarium of several trees (Nature, 327, 1987)
to determine the stomatal index (percentage of epidermal
cells that contain a stoma). In 1720, when the herbarium
samples were collected, the carbon dioxide concentration
in Earth’s atmosphere was 225 ppm. In the year of the
study, 1987, it was 340 ppm (it is 370 ppm in 2016). The
following table presents some of Woodward’s reported
results.

Teng and co-workers (PLoS ONE, 2009) followed the
dependence of Arabidopsis, a member of the Brassica
family of vascular plants, grown under a range of elevated
CO2 concentrations for 15 generations. They found
elevated stomatal densities for each generation that were
not heritable.
