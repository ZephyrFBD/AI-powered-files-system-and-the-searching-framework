in or
attached to the phospholipids.
1. The lipid portion of the membrane is composed mainly of phospholipids.
i.
Phospholipids have a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail and a hydrophilic (water-loving) head.
ii. The cytosol and the fluid outside the cell (the extracellular fluid) are both aqueous (watery)
environments.
iii. Therefore, phospholipids form a bilayer, as shown below, because the hydrophilic heads associate
with the cytoplasm and the extracellular fluid, while the hydrophobic tails associate with each
other.
2. Cholesterol, also found in membranes, helps regulate membrane fluidity in a way that can be likened
to antifreeze in a car: At low temperatures, it keeps membrane lipids from clumping together in a
solid-like state, while at high temperatures, it raises the melting point and thus decreases membrane
fluidity.
3. Embedded proteins in the cell membrane can be hydrophilic, with charged and polar side groups, or
hydrophobic, with nonpolar side groups.

The two types of p
