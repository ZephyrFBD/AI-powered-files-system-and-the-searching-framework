y changes in nuclear reactions are much 
greater than those in chemical reactions. The mass change accompanying the radioac-
tive decay of 1 mol of uranium-238, for example, is 50,000 times greater than that for the 
combustion of 1 mol of CH4. Let’s examine the energy change for the nuclear reaction
