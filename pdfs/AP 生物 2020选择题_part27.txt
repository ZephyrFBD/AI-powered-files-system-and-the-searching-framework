Figure 1. A model of an endocrine signaling pathway 
showing involved body parts and hormones. GnRH 
˜ gonadotropin-releasing hormone, LH ˜ luteinizing 
hormone, and FSH ˜ follicle-stimulating hormone. 
24. Figure 1 shows a model of the endocrine 
signaling pathway that regulates ovulation. 
Which of the following observations would 
provide evidence of a positive feedback 
mechanism in this system? 
(A) Estrogen from the ovaries inhibits the 
release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. 
(B) Progesterone from the ovaries stimulates 
the thickening of the uterine lining. 
(C) Progesterone from the ovaries inhibits the 
release of LH and FSH from the anterior 
pituitary. 
(D) Estrogen from the ovaries stimulates the 
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to 
secrete more GnRH, LH, and FSH.
