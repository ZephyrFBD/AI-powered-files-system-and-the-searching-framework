Connective Tissues
Connective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non-living substance, called the ground
substance. The ground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a
mineral or water). The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast. This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of
the connective tissues. Fibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is
needed. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues. Some tissues have
specialized cells that are not found in the others. The matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density. When a
connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers,
