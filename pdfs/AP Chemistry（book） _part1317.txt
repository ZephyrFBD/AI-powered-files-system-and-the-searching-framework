e 
number of small electronegative atoms that it has more than an oc-
tet of electrons around it. Lewis structures with more than an octet 
of electrons are observed for atoms in the third row and beyond in 
the periodic table.
STRENGTHS AND LENGTHS OF COVALENT BONDS (SECTION 8.8) 
 
The average strengths and lengths of many common covalent bonds 
can be measured. Average bond enthalpies for multiple bonds are 
generally larger than those of single bonds. The average bond length 
between two atoms decreases as the number of bonds between the 
atoms increases, consistent with the bond being stronger as the num-
ber of bonds increases.
