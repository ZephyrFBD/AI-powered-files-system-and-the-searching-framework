d solve for x.
Let’s use this process to calculate the pH at 25 °C of a 0.30 M solution of acetic acid 
1CH3COOH2.
 1. The ionization equilibrium is :
 
CH3COOH1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + CH3COO-1aq2 
[16.28]
Notice that the hydrogen that ionizes is the one attached to an oxygen atom.
 2. Taking Ka = 1.8 * 10-5 from Table 16.2, we write the equilibrium-constant expres-
sion and its value.
 
Ka =
3H+43CH3COO-4
3CH3COOH4
= 1.8 * 10-5 
[16.29]
 3. Next we express the concentrations involved in the equilibrium reaction. This can 
be done with a little accounting, as described in Sample Exercise 16.10. Because 
we want to find the equilibrium value for 3H+4, let’s call this quantity x. The con-
centration of acetic acid before any of it ionizes is 0.30 M. The chemical equation

Finally, we can compare the pH value of this weak acid with the pH of a solution of 
a strong acid of the same concentration. The pH of the 0.30 M acetic aci
