 is salinity. There are freshwater,
estuary, and marine biomes. Freshwater biomes have a salinity of less
than 0.1% and include rivers, streams, ponds, and wetlands. Some of our
freshwater reserves are stored in groundwater. Freshwater makes up less
than 4% of Earth’s aquatic biomes. Estuaries are located at the mouths of
rivers where saltwater and freshwater mix. Salt marshes and mangrove
forests are estuaries that support enormous populations of animal life.
However, the largest biome on Earth is the marine biome with a salinity of
3% on average. Here are the characteristics of marine biomes:

The marine biomes are the largest biomes, covering three-fourths of
Earth’s surface.
They are the most stable biome with temperatures that vary little
because water has a high heat capacity and there is such an
enormous volume of water.
They provide most of Earth’s food and oxygen.
The marine biomes are divided into different regions classifie
