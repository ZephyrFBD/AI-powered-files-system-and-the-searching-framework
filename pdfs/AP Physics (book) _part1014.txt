1. Stand facing a wall with your toes tight against the wall, and
go up on your tiptoes. Then turn around and push your back
against the wall with your heels tight against the wall. Using
the ideas of Section 9–4, explain why you can or cannot 
perform these motions.
2. From what minimum height must a 1.2-kg rectangular brick
be dropped above a rigid steel
floor in order to break the brick? Assume the brick strikes
the floor directly on its largest face, and that the compres-
sion of the brick is much greater than that of the steel (that
is, ignore compression of the steel). State other simplifying
assumptions that may be necessary.
3. Suppose a 65-kg person jumps from a height of 3.0 m down
to the ground. (a) What is the speed of the person just
before landing (Chapter 2)? (b) Estimate the average 
force on the person’s feet exerted by the ground to bring the
person to rest, if the knees are bent so the person’s CG
moves a distance
during the deceleration period
