ave significantly higher rates of mutation. This best matches (A). (B) is
incorrect because RNA viruses only assemble in the cytoplasm, while
DNA viruses assemble in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. (C) is
incorrect because only a specific group of RNA viruses contain reverse
transcriptase, and there is no proof that it leads to increased frameshiȇ
mutations. (D) is incorrect because the mRNA that is formed
undergoes translation, not transcription.
