different speeds depending on the velocity of the ether past the Earth.
Strange as it may seem, they detected no difference at all. This was a great
puzzle. A number of explanations were put forth over a period of years, but they
led to contradictions or were otherwise not generally accepted. This null result
was one of the great puzzles at the end of the nineteenth century.
Then in 1905, Albert Einstein proposed a radical new theory that reconciled
these many problems in a simple way. But at the same time, as we shall see, it
completely changed our ideas of space and time.

†We use the reasonable approximation that Earth is an inertial reference frame.
‡The medium for light waves could not be air, since light travels from the Sun to Earth through nearly
empty space. Therefore, another medium was postulated, the ether. The ether was not only trans-
parent but, because of difficult
