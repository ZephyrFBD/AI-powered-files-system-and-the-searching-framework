experience a larger Zeff than the 3s electron in Na, due to the greater 
shielding of the 3s electron of the Na atom by all the 2s and 2p 
electrons. page 264 These trends work against each other: Zeff 
increasing would imply that the valence electrons are pulled tighter 
in to make the atom smaller, while orbital size “increasing” would 
imply that atomic size would also increase. The orbital size effect 
is larger: As you go down a column in the periodic table, atomic 
size generally increases. page 268 It is harder to remove another 
electron from Na+, so the process in Equation 7.3 would require 
more energy and, hence, shorter-wavelength light (see Sections 6.1 
and 6.2). page 268 I2 for a carbon atom corresponds to ionizing 
an electron from C+, which has the same number of electrons as a 
neutral B atom. Zeff will be greater for C+ than for B, so I2 for a car-
bon atom will be greater than I1 for a boron atom. page 271 The
