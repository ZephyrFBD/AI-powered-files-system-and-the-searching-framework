Entropy is a quantitative measure of the disorder of a
system. The second law of thermodynamics also indicates that
as time goes on, energy is degraded to less useful forms—that is,
it is less available to do useful work.
The second law of thermodynamics tells us in which direction
processes tend to proceed; hence entropy is called “time’s arrow.”
[*Entropy can be examined from a statistical point of view,
considering macrostates (for example, P, V, T) and microstates
(state of each molecule). The most probable processes are the
ones we observe. They are the ones that increase entropy the
most. Processes that violate the second law “could” occur,
but only with extremely low probability.]
[*All heat engines give rise to thermal pollution because
they exhaust heat to the environment.]
