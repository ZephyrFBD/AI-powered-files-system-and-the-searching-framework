cant difference in
the preferences of the Drosophila, with roughly equal numbers on each side of the choice chamber. A chi-square test
is performed to find out if the null hypothesis is rejected or if you must fail to reject the null hypothesis. A sample
data set with the chi-square calculation is shown in the following table.
Since there are two possible outcomes, light and dark, there is one degree of freedom (df = number of possible
outcomes – 1). Using a p-value of 0.05 and the chi-square table, the critical value is 3.84. The calculated chi-square
value of 5.666 is greater than the critical value, so the null hypothesis (that there is no statistically significant
difference) is rejected. When the null hypothesis is rejected, an alternative hypothesis is proposed. In this case, an
alternative hypothesis might be “Drosophila prefer a dark environment to an environment with light.”
