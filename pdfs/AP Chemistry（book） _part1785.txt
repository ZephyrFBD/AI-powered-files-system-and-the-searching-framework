 In 
gases, the intermolecular attractive forces are negligible compared to 
the kinetic energies of the molecules; thus, the molecules are widely 
separated and undergo constant, chaotic motion. In liquids, the in-
termolecular forces are strong enough to keep the molecules in close 
proximity; nevertheless, the molecules are free to move with respect 
to one another. In solids, the intermolecular attractive forces are 
strong enough to restrain molecular motion and to force the parti-
cles to occupy specific locations in a three-dimensional arrangement.
INTERMOLECULAR FORCES (SECTION 11.2) Three types of intermo-
lecular forces exist between neutral molecules: dispersion forces, dipoleâ€“ 
dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Dispersion forces operate be-
tween all molecules (and atoms, for atomic substances such as He, Ne, 
Ar, and so forth). As molecular weight increases, the polarizability of a 
molecule increases, which results in stronger dispersion forces. Molec-
