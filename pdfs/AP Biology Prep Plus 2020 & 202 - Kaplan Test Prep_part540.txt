RT NOTE
Themes in Molecular Genetics
There are three key themes of molecular genetics to remember:
13.1 Diﬀerentiate between the structures of DNA and RNA
13.2 Explain the function of DNA and RNA
Be familiar with the structures of DNA and RNA and how these
building blocks provide both a simple system for duplication
and a wealth of genetic diversity that codes for variation in all
existing and extinct organisms.
1.
Know that ultimately DNA is a code for the translation of
proteins, that these proteins impart function to all of the
biological processes that make an organism alive, and that
control of expression of the genes for these proteins largely
controls bioactivity.
2.
As a complement to your understanding of evolution,
understand DNA’s role as the root of genetic change in the form
of mutations.
3.
DNA AND RNA STRUCTURES
You have undoubtedly learned that DNA and RNA molecules are long
strands of nucleotides linked together by their sugar-phosphate
backbone between the 5′ and 3′ c
