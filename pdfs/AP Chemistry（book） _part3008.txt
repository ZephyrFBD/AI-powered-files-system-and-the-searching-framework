 entropy changes are related to heat transfer and 
temperature. Our analysis will bring us to a profound statement about entropy changes 
and spontaneity known as the second law of thermodynamics.
The Relationship between Entropy and heat
The entropy, S, of a system is a state function just like internal energy, E, and enthalpy, 
H. As with these other quantities, the value of S is a characteristic of the state of a system. 
 (Section 5.2) Thus, the change in entropy, ∆S, in a system depends only on the ini-
tial and final states of the system and not on the path taken from one state to the other:
 
∆S = Sfinal - Sinitial 
[19.1]
For the special case of an isothermal process, ∆S is equal to the heat that would be 
transferred if the process were reversible, qrev, divided by the absolute temperature at 
which the process occurs:
 
∆S =
qrev
T   1constant T2 
[19.2]
Although many possible paths can take the system from one state to another, only one path is 
associated with a reversible
