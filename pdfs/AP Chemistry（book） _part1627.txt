have finite volumes.
Because of molecular collisions, the direction of motion of a gas molecule is con-
stantly changing. Therefore, the diffusion of a molecule from one point to another 
consists of many short, straight-line segments as collisions buffet it around in random 
directions (Figure 10.17).
The average distance traveled by a molecule between collisions, called the molecule’s 
mean free path, varies with pressure as the following analogy illustrates. Imagine walk-
ing through a shopping mall. When the mall is crowded (high pressure), the average dis-
tance you can walk before bumping into someone is short (short mean free path). When 
the mall is empty (low pressure), you can walk a long way (long mean free path) before 
bumping into someone. The mean free path for air molecules at sea level is about 60 nm. 
At about 100 km in altitude, where the air pressure is much lower, the mean free path is 
about 10 cm, over 1 million times longer than at the Earth’s surface.
