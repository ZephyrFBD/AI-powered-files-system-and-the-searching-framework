In males, sperm production involves three sequential meiotic
cell divisions.
A important focus of developmental biology is the timing and
mechanism of when and how individual cells and tissues organize
themselves in a developing embryo. Are cell fates somehow
predetermined, or do cells and tissues interact with one another to
orchestrate developmental processes? The groundbreaking
experiments carried out by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold
attempted to answer this question.
The experiment was performed in Xenopus laevis frog embryos
at the stage during which the three primary germ layers—the
ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm—are established. These
scientists grafted a small piece of tissue from an early frog embryo
(donor) onto a specific site on another embryo (host). In addition, by
grafting tissue between differently pigmented species, the fates of
the grafted and host tissues could be distinguished. The result was
