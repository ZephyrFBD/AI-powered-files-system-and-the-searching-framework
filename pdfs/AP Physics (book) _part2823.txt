of an image for: (a) a single point
object; (b) two point objects whose
images are barely resolved.

FIGURE 25–31 The Rayleigh criterion.
Two images are just resolvable when
the center of the diffraction peak of
one is directly over the first minimum
in the diffraction pattern of the other.
The two point objects O and 
subtend an angle at the lens; only
one ray (it passes through the center
of the lens) is drawn for each object,
to indicate the center of the
diffraction pattern of its image.

Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) is a reflecting telescope that was placed in orbit above the Earth’s
atmosphere, so its resolution would not be limited by turbulence in the atmosphere
(Fig. 25–32). Its objective diameter is 2.4 m. For visible light, say 
estimate the improvement in resolution the Hubble off
