rves that both the covered and uncovered plants grow
toward the brightest available light source. Aȇer cutting the growth
tips, this no longer occurs. Therefore, by cutting the tip, the botanist
eliminated phototropic eﬀects, since the covered plant was no longer
able to grow toward the light. This occurred because the
photoreceptors at the tip were no longer able to communicate with
cells located lower in the plant responsible for plant growth, making
(D) the correct answer. (A) and (C) can be immediately eliminated
because the eﬀects observed by the botanist are phototropic, not
photoperiodic. (B) is incorrect because not all of the plant’s
photoreceptors are gone. Plants have photoreceptors in other
locations as well, such as their roots, leaves, and flowers.

Increasing the light intensity would increase the rate of
photosynthesis. This would cause stomata to open, in order to take in
more carbon dioxide to allow the reaction to occur. The act of openin
