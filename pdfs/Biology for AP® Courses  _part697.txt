Adenosine triphosphate or ATP is the energy “currency” or carrier of the cell. When cells require an input of energy, they
use ATP. An ATP nucleotide molecule consists of a five-carbon sugar, the nitrogenous base adenine, and three phosphate
groups. (Do not confuse ATP with the nucleotides of DNA and RNA, although they have structural similarities.) The bonds
that connect the phosphate have high-energy content, and the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi
(Adenosine Diphosphate + Pyrophosphate) is used to perform cellular work, such as contracting a muscle or pumping a
solute across a cell membrane in active transport. Cells use ATP by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with
endergonic reactions, with ATP donating its phosphate group to ano
