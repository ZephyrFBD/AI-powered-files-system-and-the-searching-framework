SOLUTION
Hydrogen has one valence electron, carbon (group 4A) has four, 
and nitrogen (group 5A) has five. The total number of valence 
electrons is, therefore, 1 + 4 + 5 = 10. In principle, there are 
different ways in which we might choose to arrange the atoms. 
Because hydrogen can accommodate only one electron pair, it 
always has only one single bond associated with it. Therefore, 
C ¬H ¬N is an impossible arrangement. The remaining two  
possibilities are H ¬C ¬N and H ¬N ¬C. The first is the  
arrangement found experimentally. You might have guessed this 
because the formula is written with the atoms in this order, and 
carbon is less electronegative than nitrogen. Thus, we  
begin with the skeleton structure
H ¬C ¬N
The two bonds account for four electrons. The H atom can have 
only two electrons associated with it, and so we will not add 
any m
