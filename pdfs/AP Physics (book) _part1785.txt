1 Photocopy Machines and
Computer Printers Use Electrostatics
Photocopy machines and laser printers use electrostatic attraction to print an image.
They each use a different technique to project an image onto a special cylindrical
drum (or rotating conveyor belt). The drum is typically made of aluminum, a good
conductor; its surface is coated with a thin layer of selenium, which has the inter-
esting property (called “photoconductivity”) of being an electrical nonconductor
in the dark, but a conductor when exposed to light.
In a photocopier, lenses and mirrors focus an image of the original sheet of
paper onto the drum, much like a camera lens focuses an image on an electronic
detector or film. Step 1, done in the dark, is the placing of a uniform positive
charge on the drum’s selenium layer by a charged roller or rod: see Fig. 16–41.
