f gametes in mitosis. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect: asexual reproduction involves
the production of two new cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. If the parent
cell is diploid, then the daughter cells will be diploid. The daughter cells are identical to the parent cell, so
eliminate (B).

D
Cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action are special properties of water that are necessary for
transpiration to occur. Water is a hydrophilic, polar molecule.

B
The two species differ in their preference for water volume. Species A prefers 80 mL, and Species B
prefers 40 mL. The different watering times do not seem to play a role in growth as there is no obvious
pattern and all of the times had similar growth. Both plants prefer pH 7.

A
The top growth conditions for Species B are pH 7, 40 mL, and any time of day. In those conditions, the
Species B plants grew the tallest.

D
The plants in the watering time experiment seemed to be around 60 and 20 cm in hei
