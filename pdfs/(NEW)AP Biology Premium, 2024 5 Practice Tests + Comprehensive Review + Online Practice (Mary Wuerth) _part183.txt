s
the free energy of the reactants. Choice (B) is incorrect because it represents the activation energy of an
enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Choice (C) is incorrect because it represents the activation energy of the reaction
without the enzyme. Choice (D) represents the difference in free energy between the transition state of the
reaction without the enzyme and the products of the reaction and is therefore not the right answer.
8. (B) Enzymes increase the rate of reactions by reducing the activation energy of the reaction. Choice (A) is
incorrect because enzymes never affect the overall free energy change of the reaction. Choices (C) and (D) are
incorrect because enzymes cannot change the free energy of the reactants, nor can they change the free energy
of the products of a reaction.
9. (A) This statement accurately describes where competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors bind on enzymes.
Choice (B) is incorrect because neither competitive inhibitors nor noncompetitive inhibitors bind to
