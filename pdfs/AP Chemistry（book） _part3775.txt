 23.59  A classmate says, “A weak-field ligand usually means the 
complex is high spin.” Is your classmate correct? Explain.
 
23.60  For a given metal ion and set of ligands, is the crystal-field split-
ting energy larger for a tetrahedral or an octahedral geometry?
 23.61  For each of the following metals, write the electronic con-
figuration of the atom and its 2+ ion: (a) Mn, (b) Ru, (c) Rh. 
Draw the crystal-field energy-level diagram for the d orbitals 
of an octahedral complex, and show the placement of the d 
electrons for each 2+ ion, assuming a strong-field complex. 
How many unpaired electrons are there in each case?

figuration of the atom and its 3+ ion: (a) Fe, (b) Mo,  (c) Co. 
Draw the crystal-field energy-level diagram for the d orbitals 
of an octahedral complex, and show the plac
