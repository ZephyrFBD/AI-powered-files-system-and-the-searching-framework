 
two important and general reaction types as we discuss the nonmet-
als: oxidation by O2 and proton-transfer reactions involving H2O or 
aqueous solutions.
HYDROGEN (SECTION 22.2) Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium 
11
1H2, deuterium 12
1H2, and tritium 13
1H2. Hydrogen is not a member of 
any particular periodic group, although it is usually placed above 
lithium. The hydrogen atom can either lose an electron, forming H+, 
or gain one, forming H -  (the hydride ion). Because the H Â¬ H bond 
is relatively strong, H2 is fairly unreactive unless activated by heat 
or a catalyst. Hydrogen forms a very strong bond to oxygen, so the 
reactions of H2 with oxygen-containing compounds usually lead to 
the formation of H2O. The H+1aq2 ion is able to oxidize many metals, 
forming H21g2. The electrolysis of water also forms H21g2.
The binary compounds of hydrogen are of three general types: 
ionic hydrides (formed by active metals), metallic hydrides (formed by 
transition metals), and molecul
