le-
cule can undergo three kinds of more complex motion. The entire molecule can 
move in one direction, which is the simple motion we visualize for an ideal particle 
and see in a macroscopic object, such as a thrown baseball. We call such movement 
translational motion. The molecules in a gas have more freedom of translational 
motion than those in a liquid, which have more freedom of translational motion than 
the molecules of a solid.
A real molecule can also undergo vibrational motion, in which the atoms in 
the molecule move periodically toward and away from one another, and rotational 
motion, in which the molecule spins about an axis. Figure 19.8 shows the vibrational 
motions and one of the rotational motions possible for the water molecule. These differ-
ent forms of motion are ways in which a molecule can store energy.
