NaOH that has a pH of 11.50.
 16.48  Calculate the concentration of an aqueous solution of 
Ca1OH22 that has a pH of 10.05.
Weak Acids (Section 16.6)
 16.49  Write the chemical equation and the Ka expression for the 
ionization of each of the following acids in aqueous solu-

CHAPTER 16 Acidâ€“Base Equilibria
 16.66  Tartaric acid is found in many fruits, including grapes, and is 
partially responsible for the dry texture of certain wines. Cal-
culate the pH and the tartrate ion 1C4H4O6
2-2 concentration 
for a 0.250 M solution of tartaric acid, for which the acid-disso-
ciation constants are listed in Table 16.3. Did you have to make 
any approximations or assumptions in your calculation?
Weak Bases (Section 16.7)
 16.67  Consider the base hydroxylamine, NH2OH. (a) What is the 
conjugate acid of hydroxylamine? (b) When it
