Weightlessness
People and other objects in a satellite circling the Earth are said to experience
apparent weightlessness. Let us first look at a simpler case: a falling elevator. In
Fig. 5–24a, an elevator is at rest with a bag hanging from a spring scale. The 
scale reading indicates the downward force exerted on it by the bag. This force,
exerted on the scale, is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the scale
upward on the bag, and we call its magnitude w (for “weight”). Two forces act on
the bag: the downward gravitational force and the upward force exerted by the
scale equal to w. Because the bag is not accelerating
when we apply
to the bag in Fig. 5–24a we obtain
where mg is the weight of the bag. Thus,
and since the scale indicates
the force w exerted on it by the bag, it registers a force equal to the weight of the
bag, as we expect.
Now let the elevator have an acceleration, a. Applying Newton’s second law,
to the bag as seen from a
