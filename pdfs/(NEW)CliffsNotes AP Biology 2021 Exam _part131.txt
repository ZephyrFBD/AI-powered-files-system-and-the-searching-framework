t chain, from one protein complex to the next (shown as a shaded strip within the inner membrane).
3. H+ ions (protons) are transported from the matrix to the intermembrane compartment. Protein complexes
transport H+ ions
 
from the matrix, across the inner membrane, and to the intermembrane space (3A, 3B, 3C).
 
4. A pH and electrical gradient across the inner membrane is created.
 
As H+ are transferred from the matrix to the intermembrane space, the concentration of H+ increases (pH decreases)
in the intermembrane
 
space (4A) and decreases in the matrix (pH increases). The
 
concentration of H+ in the matrix decreases further as electrons at the end of the electron transport chain (PC IV)
combine with H+ and
oxygen to form water (4B). The result is a proton gradient (equivalent to a pH gradient) and an electric charge (or
voltage) gradient. These gradients are potential energy reserves in the same manner as water behind a dam is stored
energy.
5. ATP synthase generates ATP. ATP syn
