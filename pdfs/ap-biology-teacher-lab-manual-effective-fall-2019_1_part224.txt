■ THE INVESTIGATIONS  
■ Getting Started 
This particular investigation provides a lab environment, guidance, and a problem 
designed to help you understand and develop the skill of modeling biological 
phenomena with computers. There are dozens of computer models already built and 
available for free. The idea for this laboratory is for you to build your own from scratch. 
To obtain the maximum benefit from this exercise, you should not do too much 
background preparation. As you build your model and explore it, you should develop a 
more thorough understanding of how genes behave in population. 
To help you begin, you might want to work with physical models of population 
genetics, such as simulations that your teacher can share with you. With these pencil-
and-paper simulations, you can obtain some insights that may help you develop your 
computer model.
