Show that this corresponds to an energy

50. Calculate the Q-value for each of the reactions, Eq. 32–4,
for producing a pion.
51. How many fundamental fermions are there in a water
molecule?
52. The mass of a 
can be measured by observing the reaction
with initial kinetic energies near zero.
The neutron is observed to be emitted with a kinetic energy
of 0.60 MeV. Use conservation of energy and momentum
to determine the 
mass.
53. (a) Show that the so-called unification distance of 
in grand unified theory is equivalent to an energy of

Use the uncertainty principle, and also 
de Broglie’s wavelength formula, and explain how they
apply. (b) Calculate the temperature corresponding to
