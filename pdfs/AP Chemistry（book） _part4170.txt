we see that it is 142.3 kJ>mol. page 191 To transform a Cl2 molecule 
into two separate Cl atoms the Cl¬ Cl bond must be broken which 
requires an input of energy. Therefore, the Cl2 molecule will have a 
lower energy and be more stable. The difference in energy between 
the two is the Cl¬ Cl bond dissociation energy, 242 kJ/mol.  
page 195 Reacting 1 mol of glucose releases 2803 kJ of energy. The 
molar mass of glucose is 180.6 g, so the amount of energy released 
when 1 g is reacted is 2803 kJ/18.6 g = 15.56 kJ/g. This value is close 
to the average value for carbohydrates (17 kJ/g) as expected.

Their differing ability to penetrate skin is due to their different 
energies, which we will discuss in the next section.  page 217 The
