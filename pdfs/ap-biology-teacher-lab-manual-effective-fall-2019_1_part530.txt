tigation without difficulty? What 
additional questions did students raise? Did they have ideas for how they could 
explore answers to their questions? 
3. Did students have sufficient mathematical skills to calculate transformation  
efficiency?  
4. What technical challenges did students have using the equipment required for the 
investigation? Have students list their challenge areas and discuss solutions. 
■ Where Can Students Go from Here? 
The background to this investigation asks students to think about several applications of 
genetic transformation, including genetically modified food and possible ethical, social, 
or medical issues raised by the manipulation of DNA by biotechnology. Ask students to 
discuss why these issues are “issues.” What questions are posed by genetic engineering? 
Students also can respond to the quote from Michael Crichton’s novel and film Jurassic 
Park: “Just because science can do something doesn’t mean that it should.”
