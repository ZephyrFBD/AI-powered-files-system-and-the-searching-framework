ertebrate density, vertebrate richness, and
macroinvertebrate density in restored wetlands versus natural
wetlands. Figure B shows plant density and richness in restored
wetlands. The dotted line represents the values for reference
wetlands. Negative values represent numbers below those of the
reference wetlands.

Although plants have the lowest mean response ratios
initially, they stabilize at a similar level to macroinvertebrates
aȇer extended periods of time.
(A)
Although plants all reach relatively stable levels equivalent to
those found in reference wetlands, animals in the studied
locations do not.
(B)
Macroinvertebrate density in manipulated wetlands never
reaches the levels found in reference wetlands.
(C)
Although vertebrates may be able to colonize wetla
