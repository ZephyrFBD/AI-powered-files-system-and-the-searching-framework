For a given substance, do you expect the density of the substance in its liquid 
state to be closer to the density in the gaseous state or in the solid state?
Particles are far apart; 
possess complete freedom 
of motion; kinetic energies of 
particles >> energies of 
particle–particle attraction.
Particles are closely packed 
but randomly oriented; retain 
freedom of motion; kinetic
