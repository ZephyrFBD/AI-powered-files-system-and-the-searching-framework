b.
The descending limb of the loop of Henle is
water impermeable, so the water flows from the
filtrate to the interstitial fluid. Osmolality in the
limb increases, and it is higher inside the loop
than in the interstitial fluid. As the filtrate enters
the ascending limb, Na+ and Cl- ions exit
through ion channels present in the cell
membrane. Further up, only sodium is passively
transported out of the filtrate.
