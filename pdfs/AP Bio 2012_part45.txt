37. In a hypothetical population of beetles, there is a wide variety of color, matching the range of coloration of the 
tree trunks on which the beetles hide from predators. The graphs below illustrate four possible changes to the 
beetle population as a result of a change in the environment due to pollution that darkened the tree trunks. 
 
 
 
  Which of the following includes the most likely change in the coloration of the beetle population after pollution 
and a correct rationale for the change? 
(A) The coloration range shifted toward more light-colored beetles, as in diagram I. The pollution helped the 
predators find the darkened tree trunks. 
(B) The coloration in the population split into two extremes, as in diagram II. Both the lighter-colored and the 
darker-colored beetles were able to hide on the darker tree trunks. 
(C) The coloration range became narrower, as in diagram
