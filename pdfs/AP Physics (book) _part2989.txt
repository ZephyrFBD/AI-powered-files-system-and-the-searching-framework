Electron microscopes (EM) produce images using electrons which have wave properties
just as light does. Because the wavelength of electrons can be much smaller than that of
visible light, much greater resolution and magnification can be obtained. A scanning
electron microscope (SEM) can produce images with a three-dimensional quality.
All EM images are monochromatic (black and white). Artistic coloring has been
added here, as is common. On the left is an SEM image of a blood clot forming
