Replication of the lagging strand of DNA would produce multiple short fragments that would need to be
joined by ligase. An inhibitor of ligase would prevent this from happening.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) DNA polymerase needs a 3′ hydroxyl group to which it can add new nucleotides, so a primer is necessary to
allow DNA polymerase to add the first new nucleotide.
(b)
(c) Each cycle of PCR doubles the number of copies of the desired DNA sequence. In other words, this is an
exponential growth relationship.
(d) Since the number of copies of the desired DNA sequence doubles with each cycle, a minimum of 10 cycles
would be required to produce at least 1,000 copies. After 8 cycles, 256 copies would be present. After 9
cycles, 512 copies would be present, and after 10 cycles, 1,024 copies would be present.
