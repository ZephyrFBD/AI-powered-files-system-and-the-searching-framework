3.95 C8H8O3 3.99 (a) 1.19 * 10-5 mol NaI 
(b) 8.1 * 10-3 g NaI 3.103 7.5 mol H2 and 4.5 mol N2 present initially 
3.108 6.46 * 1024 O atoms 3.112 (a) S1s2 + O21g2 ¡ SO21g2; 
SO21g2 + CaO1s2 ¡ CaSO31s2 (b) 7.9 * 107 g CaO

4.1 Diagram (c) represents Li2SO4 4.5 BaCl2 4.7 Platinum will nei-
ther be oxidized by nor dissolve in any of the three available solu-
tions.  Lead is oxidized by and will dissolve in the nitric acid solution, 
but not the nickel nitrate solution.  Zinc is oxidized by and will dis-
solve in both nitric acid and nickel nitrate solutions. 4.9 The “water-
splitting” reaction is (c), a redox reaction. 4.13 (a) False. Electrolyte 
solutions conduct electricity because ions are moving through the 
solution. Because ions are mobile in solution, the added presence of 
uncharged molecules does not inhibit conductivity. 4.15 Statement 
(b) is most correct. 4.17 (a) FeCl21aq2 ¡ Fe2+1aq2 + 2 Cl-1aq2  
(b) HNO31aq2 ¡ H+1aq2 + NO3
-1aq2 
(c) 1NH422S
