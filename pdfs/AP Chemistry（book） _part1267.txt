n ionic solid with an arrangement of atoms analogous to the 
sodium chloride structure shown in Figure 8.4. However, it is possible to generate LiF mole-
cules by vaporizing the ionic solid at high temperature. The molecules have a dipole moment 
of 6.28 D and a bond distance of 1.53 Ã…. From these values we can calculate the charge on 
lithium and fluorine to be 0.857+ and 0.857-, respectively. This bond is extremely polar, 
and the presence of such large charges strongly favors the formation of an extended ionic lat-
tice in which each lithium ion is surrounded by fluoride ions and vice versa. But even here, 
the experimentally determined charges on the ions are still not 1+ and 1-. This tells us that 
even in ionic compounds, there is still some covalent contribution to the bonding.
Comparing Ionic and Covalent Bonding
To understand the interactions responsible for chemical bonding, it is advantageous to treat 
ionic and covalent bonding separately. That is the approach taken in this
