 a gray, crescent-shaped region that appears in a frog egg during a reorganization of the
cytoplasm following the penetration by a sperm. Embryologist Hans Spemann, in a famous experiment, separated
the cells formed during early cleavages and showed that each individual cell could develop into a normal frog only if
it contained a portion of the gray crescent.
Morphogens are proteins whose asymmetrical distribution in the cytoplasm of the oocyte determines the
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axes of the cell. Subsequent cell divisions result in morphogen gradients across
the developing embryo. Then, in each cell, the morphogens act as transcription factors, activating or inhibiting DNA
expression specific for that part of the embryo.
3. Embryonic induction. Embryonic induction is the influence of one cell or group of cells over neighboring cells.
Cells that exert this influence are called organizers. This cell-to-cell communication can occur by way of diffusible
chemicals or by in
