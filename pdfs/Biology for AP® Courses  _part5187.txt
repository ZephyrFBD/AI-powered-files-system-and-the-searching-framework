 coronavirus! A wave of the magic wand and poof, an
in silico (computer-generated) genome, a scientiﬁc fantasy, was
created. UK health researcher Dr Kevin CorbeĴ made the same point
with this analogy:
… It’s like giving you a few bones and saying that’s your fish. It could be any fish. Not even a
skeleton. Here’s a few fragments of bones. That’s your fish … It’s all from gene bank and the
bits of the virus sequence that weren’t there they made up.
They synthetically created them to fill in the blanks. That’s what genetics is; it’s a code. So it’s
ABBBCCDDD and you’re missing some what you think is EEE so you put it in. It’s all
synthetic. You just manufacture the bits that are missing. This is the end result of the
geneticization of virology. This is basically a computer virus.
Further conﬁrmation came in an email exchange between British
citizen journalist Frances Leader and the government’s Medicines &
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the Gates-funded MHRA)
which gave emergency
