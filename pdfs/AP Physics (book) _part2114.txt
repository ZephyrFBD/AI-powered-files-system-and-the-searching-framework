ral wire, normally
small; but if connections are poor or corroded, or the plug is loose, the resistance
could be large enough that you might feel that voltage if you touched the neutral
wire some distance from its grounding point.
Some electrical devices come with only two wires, and the plug’s two prongs
are of different widths; the plug can be inserted only one way into the outlet so
that the intended neutral (wider prong) in the device is connected to neutral in
the wiring (Fig. 19–28). For example, the screw threads of a lightbulb are meant
to be connected to neutral (and the base contact to hot), to avoid shocks when
changing a bulb in a possibly protruding socket. Devices with 2-prong plugs do
not have their cases grounded; they are supposed to have double electric insulation
(or have a nonmetal case). Take extra care anyway.
The insulation on a wire may be color coded. Hand-held meters (Section 19–8)
may have red (hot) and black (ground) lead wires. But in a U.S. house, the hot
