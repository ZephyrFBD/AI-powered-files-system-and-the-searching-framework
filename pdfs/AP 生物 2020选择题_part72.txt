rectangular solids and their surface area-to-volume 
ratios. 
(c) Using the data from the model, evaluate the hypothesis that cells shaped like rectangular solids 1 and 2 are

(d) Based on the trends shown in the data, explain why some rectangular cells include folds or projections in 
their plasma membranes.
