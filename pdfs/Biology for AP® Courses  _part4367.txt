 gets large
enough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (Figure
36.9). This population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is
called the carrying capacity, or K.
The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The
expression “K – N” is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and “K – N”
divided by “K” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is
restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:
dN
dT = rmax dN
dT = rmax N(K -  N)
K
Notice that when N is very small, (K-N)/K becomes close to K/K or 1, and the right side of the equation reduces to rmaxN,
which means the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity. On the other hand, when
