eventually came to be called radioactivity.
Soon after Becquerel’s discovery, Marie Curie (1867–1934) and her husband,
Pierre Curie (1859–1906), isolated two previously unknown elements that were
very highly radioactive (Fig. 30–3). These were named polonium and radium.
Other radioactive elements were soon discovered as well. The radioactivity was
found in every case to be unaffected by the strongest physical and chemical
treatments, including strong heating or cooling or the action of strong chemicals.
It was suspected that the source of radioactivity must be deep within the atom,
coming from the nucleus. It became apparent that radioactivity is the result 
of the disintegration or decay of an unstable nucleus. Certain isotopes are not
stable, and they decay with the emission of some type of radiation or “rays.”
Many unstable isotopes occur in nature, and such radioactivity is called
“natural radioactivity.” Other unstable isotopes can be produced in the laboratory
by nuclear reac
