 ceased to occur, death could result.
iii. Biological processes are in place to help offset increased disorder and entropy and to help maintain
order within a system; therefore, energy input into the system must exceed the loss of free energy
to maintain order and to power cellular processes.
iv. Energy storage and growth can result from excess acquired free energy beyond the required
energy necessary for maintenance and order within a system.
v. Changes in free energy can affect population size and disrupt an ecosystem.
5. Metabolismâ€”the totality of all chemical reactions that occur within an organism.
i.
Reproduction and rearing of offspring require free energy beyond what is normally required for
the maintenance and growth of the organism. Energy availability can vary, and different
organisms utilize a variety of reproductive strategies as a consequence. Some examples include
seasonal reproduction by animals and plants and life-history strategy (biennial plants, reproductive
