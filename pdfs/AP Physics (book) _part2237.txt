ion. This can be achieved in a dc motor with the use
of commutators and brushes: as shown in Fig. 20–38, input current passes through
stationary brushes that rub against the conducting commutators mounted on the
motor shaft. At every half revolution, each commutator changes its connection
over to the other brush. Thus the current in the coil reverses every half revolution
as required for continuous rotation.

alternation of the current in the
armature to keep rotation continuous
in one direction. The commutators are
attached to the motor shaft and turn
with it, whereas the b
