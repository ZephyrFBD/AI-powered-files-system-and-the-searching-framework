ary reaction, we are able to write the rate law using 
the coefficients for the reactants in the equation as the reaction 
orders.
Solve The reaction is bimolecular, involving one molecule of H2 
and one molecule of Br2. Thus, the rate law is first order in each 
reactant and second order overall:
Rate = k3H243Br24
Comment Experimental studies of this reaction show that the reac-
tion actually has a very different rate law:
Rate = k3H243Br241>2

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
The Rate-Determining Step for a Multistep Mechanism
As with the reaction in Sample Exercise 14.13, most reactions occur by mechanisms that 
involve two or more elementary reactions. Each step of the mechanism has its own rate 
constant and activation energy. Often one step is much slower than the others, and the 
overall rate of a reaction cannot exceed the rate of the slowest elementary step. Because 
the slow step limits the overall reaction rate, it is call
