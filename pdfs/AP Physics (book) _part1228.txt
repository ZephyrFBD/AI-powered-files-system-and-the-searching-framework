When two waves pass through the same region of space 
at the same time, they interfere. The resultant displacement at
any point and time is the sum of their separate displacements
(
the superposition principle). This can result in constructive
interference, destructive interference, or something in between,
depending on the amplitudes and relative phases of the waves.
Waves traveling on a string of fixed length interfere with
waves that have reflected off the end and are traveling back in
the opposite direction. At certain frequencies, standing waves can
be produced in which the waves seem to be standing still rather
than traveling. The string (or other medium) is vibrating as a
whole. This is a resonance phenomenon, and the frequencies
at which standing waves occur are called resonant frequencies.
Points of destructive interference (no oscillation) are called
nodes. Points of constructi
