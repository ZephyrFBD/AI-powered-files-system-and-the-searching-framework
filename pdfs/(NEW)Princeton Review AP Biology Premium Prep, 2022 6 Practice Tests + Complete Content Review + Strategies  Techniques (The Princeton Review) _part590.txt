ls will stay in the
G1 phase (specifically in an extension of G1 called G0) phase. This is a reading comprehension question.
The passage states that cells that do not divide are arrested at the G1 phase. Choice (A) is incorrect
because these cells will not be committed to go through cell division. You can also eliminate (C) and (D),
as the cells will not enter the M or S phase.

D
Since Snippeiq has the most differences with the other organisms it must be at position S. This means that
Gerdellen cannot be there, which makes (D) the best answer. (Position Q or R is the best position for
Gerdellen, though positions O and P could possibly be correct as well.)
54.
C
Position III, (C), contains the oldest common ancestor because it is the node for all the current species
designated by the lettered positions.
55.
A
Snippeiq, (A), is the out-group because it is the least related to the other species. The table shows that
Snippeiq has the most differences from all of the other species.
