triple-bond enthalpies. Here, we see a 
trend that is different from that for the X¬X single bond. Nitrogen forms a much stron-
ger triple bond than the other elements, and there is a steady decline in the triple-bond 
enthalpy down through the group. These data help us to appreciate why nitrogen alone 
of the group 5A elements exists as a diatomic molecule in its stable state at 25 °C. All the 
other elements exist in structural forms with single bonds between the atoms.
Occurrence, Isolation, and Properties of Phosphorus
Phosphorus occurs mainly in the form of phosphate minerals. The principal source of 
phosphorus is phosphate rock, which contains phosphate principally as Ca31PO422. The 
element is produced commercially by the reduction of calcium phosphate with carbon 
in the presence of SiO2:
  2 Ca31PO4221s2 + 6 SiO21s2 + 10 C1s2 ¡
1500 °C P41g2 + 6 CaSiO31l2 + 10 CO1g2 
[22.43]
The phosphorus produced in this fashion is the allotrope known as white 
phosphorus. This form distill
