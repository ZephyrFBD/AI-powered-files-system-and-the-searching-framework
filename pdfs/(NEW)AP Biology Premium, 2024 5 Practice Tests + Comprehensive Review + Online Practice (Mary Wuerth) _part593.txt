stigation, the cell cycle and mitosis can be modeled using beads, pipe cleaners, clay,
or a variety of other tools. After modeling the cell cycle and mitosis, you should have a better understanding of:
The part of the cell cycle during which the genetic information of a cell is duplicated
Why chromosomes condense before they are separated
How the sister chromatids in a chromosome are separated and the result if a pair of sister chromatids fail to
separate
Part 2: In this part of the lab, cells are treated with a chemical and are compared to untreated cells to find out
whether the chemical alters the rate of mitosis. Slides are prepared from both the treated and untreated groups, and
the number of cells in mitosis and interphase are recorded for each group. A chi-square test is used to determine
whether there is a statistically significant difference between the number of cells in mitosis and interphase in each
group. The null hypothesis for this experiment is that there is no statistic
