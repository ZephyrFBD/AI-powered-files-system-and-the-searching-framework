Write the condensed structural formula for the product of the hydrogenation of 3-methyl-1-pentene.
Sample Exercise 24.5 
Predicting the Product of an Addition Reaction
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to predict the compound formed when a par-
ticular alkene undergoes hydrogenation (reaction with H2) and to 
write the condensed structural formula of the product.
Plan To determine the condensed structural formula of the prod-
uct, we must first write the condensed structural formula or Lewis 
structure of the reactant. In the hydrogenation of the alkene, H2 
adds to the double bond, producing an alkane.
Solve The name of the starting compound tells us that we have a 
chain of five C atoms with a double bond at one end (position 1) 
and a methyl group on C3:
CH2
CH2
CH
CH
CH3
CH3
Hydrogenation—the addition of two H atoms to the carbons of 
the double bond—leads to the following alkane:
CH2
CH
CH3
CH3
CH3
CH2
Comment The longest chain in this alkane has five carbon atoms; 
the product is
