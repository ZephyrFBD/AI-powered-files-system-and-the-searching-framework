to record the stage of each cell you encounter as you scan
left to right, and top to bottom across the blastula section.
7.
Keep a tally of your observations and stop when you reach 100 cells identified.
8.
The larger the sample size (total number of cells counted), the more accurate the results. If possible, gather and
record group data prior to calculating percentages and making estimates.
Record your observations: Make a table similar to Table 10.2 in which you record your observations.
