en set of data.
Draw conclusions about 
the experiment based on 
the comparison of the chi-
square value to the p-value.
Have students perform 
the animal behavior lab of 
your choice. They should 
formulate the null and 
alternative hypotheses and 
then calculate the chi-square 
test statistic. Once the chi-
square statistic has been 
calculated, students compare 
it to the p-value in order 
to compare the observed 
versus the predicted patterns 
in animal behavior. 
Misconception Check
5.D: Use data to 
evaluate a hypothesis 
(or prediction), including
a. Rejecting or failing 
to reject the null 
hypothesis.
b. Supporting or 
refuting the alternative 
hypothesis.
Make a prediction using 
the data, and then justify
the prediction.
 
Given data and a prediction, 
justify the prediction.
Given a null hypothesis 
and a graph, determine if
the null hypothesis should 
be rejected.
