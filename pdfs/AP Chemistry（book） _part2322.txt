 (a) Determine the rate law for the reaction and state the 
units of the rate constant. (b) What is the average value 
of the rate constant for the disappearance of S2O8
2 -  
based on the four sets of data? (c) How is the rate of dis-
appearance of S2O8
2 -  related to the rate of disappearance 
of I -? (d) What is the rate of disappearance of I -  when 
3S2O8
2-4 = 0.025 M and 3I -4 = 0.050 M ?

 14.39 (a) For the generic reaction A S B what quantity, when 
graphed versus time, will yield a straight line for a 
first-order reaction? (b) How can you calculate the rate 
constant for a first-order reaction from the graph you 
made in part (a)?
