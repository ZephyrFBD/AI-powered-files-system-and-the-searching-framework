 properties that fall between 
those of metals and nonmetals. These elements are often referred to as metalloids.
Copper, silver, and gold were traditionally employed to make coins, 
but modern coins are typically made from other metals (Figure 2.15). 
To be useful for coinage, a metal, or combination of metals (called 
an alloy), must be corrosion resistant. It must also be hard enough 
to withstand rough usage and yet be of a consistency that permits 
machines to accurately stamp the coins. Some metals that might oth-
erwise make fine coins—for example, manganese (Mn)—are ruled 
out because they make the coins too hard to stamp. A third criterion 
is that the value of the metal in the coin should not be as great as the 
face value of the coin.
This last criterion has led to several changes in the composition 
of U.S. coins over the past century. The U.S. Mint ceased producing 
gold coins in 1933 during the Great Depression. In 1964, a silver cri-
sis caused the replacement of silver
