is valid for the average
power in alternating currents when the rms values of V and I
are used.
[ The current in a wire, at the microscopic level, is consid-
ered to be a slow drift velocity of electrons,
The current I is
given by
(18–10)
where n is the number of free electrons per unit volume, e is
the magnitude of the charge on an electron, and A is the cross-
sectional area of the wire.]
[ At very low temperatures certain materials become
superconducting, which means their electrical resistance
becomes zero.]
[ The human nervous system operates via electrical con-
duction: when a nerve “fires,” an electrical signal travels as a
voltage pulse known as an action potential.]
