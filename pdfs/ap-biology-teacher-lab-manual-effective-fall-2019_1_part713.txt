ethods of calculating leaf surface 
area. (You will need to calculate leaf surface area when you conduct your experiments.) 
Think about and formulate answers to the following questions as you work through this 
activity: 
a. How can you calculate the total leaf surface area expressed in cm2? In mm2? 
b. How can you estimate the leaf surface area of the entire plant without measuring 
every leaf? 
c. What predictions and/or hypotheses can you make about the number of stomata 
per mm2 and the rate of transpiration? 
d. Is the leaf surface area directly related to the rate of transpiration? 
e. What predictions can you make about the rate of transpiration in plants with 
smaller or fewer leaves? 
f. Because most leaves have two sides, do you think you have to double your 
calculation to obtain the surface area of one leaf? Why or why not? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
g. Water is transpired through stomata, but carbon dioxide also must pass through 
stomata into a leaf for photosynthesis to occur. Th
