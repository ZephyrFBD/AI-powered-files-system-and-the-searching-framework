with temperature, 
then an increase in T will serve to make ∆G°
soln more negative. 
Thus, the driving force for dissolution of the salts will increase 
with increasing T, and we therefore expect the solubility of 
the salts to increase with increasing T. In Figure 13.18, we see 
that the solubility of NaCl (and that of nearly any other salt) 
increases with increasing temperature.

SPONTANEOUS PROCESSES (SECTION 19.1) Most reactions and 
chemical processes have an inherent directionality: They are sponta-
neous in one direction and nonspontaneous in the reverse direction. 
The spontaneity of a process is related to the thermodynamic path 
the system takes from the initial state to the final state. In a revers-
ible process, both the system and its surroundings can be restored to 
their original state by exactly reversing the change. In an irreversible 
process, the system cannot return to its original state without a per-
manent change in
