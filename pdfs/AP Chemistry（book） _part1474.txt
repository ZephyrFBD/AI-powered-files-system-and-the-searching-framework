scles, kill foreign cells, and reinforce memory. The 1998 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three scientists for their research that 
uncovered the importance of NO as a “signaling” molecule in the cardiovascular system. 
NO also functions as a neurotransmitter and is implicated in many other biological path-
ways. That NO plays such an important role in human metabolism was unsuspected before 
1987 because NO has an odd number of electrons and is highly reactive. The molecule has 
11 valence electrons, and two possible Lewis structures can be drawn. The Lewis structure 
with the lower formal charges places the odd electron on the N atom:

Both structures indicate the presence of a double bond, but when compared with the 
molecules in Figure 9.43, the experimental bond length of NO (1.15 Å) suggests a bond 
order greater than 2. How do we treat NO using the MO model?
If the atoms in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule do not differ too greatly in elec
