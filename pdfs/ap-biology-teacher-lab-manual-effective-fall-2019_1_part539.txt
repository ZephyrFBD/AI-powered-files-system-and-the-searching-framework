signing your own 
experiments to manipulate DNA. 
 
This investigation also provides you with the opportunity to review, connect, and 
apply concepts that you have studied previously, including cell structure of bacteria; 
structure and function of cell membranes, enzymes, and DNA and RNA; transcription 
and translation; the operon model of the regulation of gene expression; evolution and 
natural selection; and interactions between organisms and their environment. 
Interspersed within each investigation are supplemental activities designed to 
keep you on track and to provide opportunities for you to take a deeper dive into the 
concepts. Your teacher may assign these activities for homework or ask that you do 
them as you work through each investigation.
