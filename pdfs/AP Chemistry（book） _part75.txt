Acknowledgments
The production of a textbook is a team effort requiring the in-
volvement of many people besides the authors who contributed 
hard work and talent to bring this edition to life. Although their 
names donâ€™t appear on the cover of the book, their creativity, 
time, and support have been instrumental in all stages of its de-
velopment and production.
Each of us has benefited greatly from discussions with col-
leagues and from correspondence with instructors and students 
both here and abroad. Colleagues have also helped immense-
ly by reviewing our materials, sharing their insights, and pro-
viding suggestions for improvements. For this edition, we were 
particularly blessed with an exceptional group of accuracy 
checkers who read through our materials looking for both tech-
nical inaccuracies and typographical errors.
