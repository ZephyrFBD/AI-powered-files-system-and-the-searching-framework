tocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released. This means the signaling
cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell (the prefix auto- means self, a reminder that the signaling cell sends a
signal to itself). This type of signaling often occurs during the early development of an organism to ensure that cells develop
into the correct tissues and take on the proper function. Autocrine signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory
responses. Further, if a cell is infected with a virus, the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death, killing
the virus in the process. In some cases, neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand. In
embryological development, this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation
of identical cells into the same cell type, thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome.
