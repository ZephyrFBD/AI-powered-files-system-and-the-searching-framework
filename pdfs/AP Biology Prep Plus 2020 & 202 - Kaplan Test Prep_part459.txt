f the
cell. This process is called disjunction, and it accounts for a fundamental
Mendelian law: independent assortment. During disjunction, each
chromosome of paternal origin separates (or disjoins) from its
homologue of maternal origin and either chromosome can end up in
either daughter cell. Thus, the distribution of homologous chromosomes
to the two intermediate daughter cells is random with respect to parental
origin. Each daughter cell will have a unique pool of alleles (genes coding
for alternative forms of a given trait; e.g., yellow flowers or purple
flowers) from a random mixture of maternal and paternal origin. In other
words, each daughter cell will almost certainly have some chromosomes
of paternal origin and some of maternal origin, rather than all paternal or
all maternal.
Telophase I
A nuclear membrane forms around each new nucleus. At this point, each
chromosome still consists of sister chromatids joined at the centromere.
The cell divides (by cytokinesis) into two dau
