athing in toxic environments, oxy-
gen must be generated in the mask and exhaled carbon dioxide in the mask must be 
eliminated. Moisture in the breath causes the KO2 to decompose to O2 and KOH, and the 
KOH removes CO2 from the exhaled breath:
 
2 OH -1aq2 + CO21g2 ¡  H2O1l2 + CO3
2 -1aq2

Hydrogen peroxide (Figure 22.14) is the most familiar and commercially important 
peroxide. Pure hydrogen peroxide is a clear, syrupy liquid that melts at -0.4 °C. Concen-
trated hydrogen peroxide is dangerously reactive because the decomposition to water 
and oxygen is very exothermic:
 
2 H2O21l2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2 + O21g2 ∆H° = -196.1 kJ 
[22.28]
This is an example of a disproportionation reaction, in which an element is simulta-
neously oxidized and reduced. The oxidation number of oxygen changes from -1 to -2 
and 0.
Hydrogen peroxide is marketed as a chemical reagent in aqueous solutions of up to 
about 30% by mass. A solution containing about 3% H2O2 by mass is sold in drugstores 
and used as
