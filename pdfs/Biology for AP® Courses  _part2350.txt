Steps of Virus Infections
A virus must use cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural
changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called cytopathic (causing cell damage) effects,
can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus
known as rhinovirus, die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death), releasing all progeny virions at
once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attemp
