orm when a hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to one electronegative atom is also attracted to another
electronegative atom. Water molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds.
Although hydrogen bonds are individually weak, they are strong when present in large numbers. Because water
reacts well with other polar substances, it makes a great solvent; it can dissolve many kinds of substances. The
hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together contribute to a number of special properties, including cohesion,
adhesion, surface tension, high heat capacity, and expansion on freezing.
Cohesion and Adhesion
As mentioned above, water molecules have a strong tendency to stick together. That is, water exhibits cohesive
forces. These forces are extremely important to life. For instance, during transpiration, water molecules evaporate
from a leaf, “pulling” on neighboring water molecules. These, in turn, draw up the molecules immediately behind
them, and so on, all the way down the plant v
