The concepts in Unit 7 build on foundational content from previous units as students discover 
natural selection, a mechanism of evolution—the theory that populations that are better 
adapted to their environment will survive and reproduce. Thus, the evolution of a species 
involves a change in its genetic makeup over time. In this unit, students study the evidence for 
and mechanisms of evolutionary change. Students also learn what happens when a species 
does not adapt to a changing or volatile environment and about the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
as a model for describing and predicting allele frequencies in nonevolving populations. Students 
will learn to calculate and draw conclusions about the evolution, or lack thereof, of a population 
from data related to allele frequencies. Biological principles studied here and in previous units 
will culminate in Unit 8, which covers ecology.
