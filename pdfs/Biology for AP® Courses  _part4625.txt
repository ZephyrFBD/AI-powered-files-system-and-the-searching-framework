nability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem species
and/or environment. Ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic disturbances caused by
natural forces and/or human activity. Ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium state can often recover from such
disturbances and return to a state of equilibrium. As most ecosystems are subject to periodic disturbances and are often
in a state of change, they are usually either moving toward or away from their equilibrium state. There are many of these
equilibrium states among the various components of an ecosystem, which affects the ecosystem overall. Furthermore, as
humans have the ability to greatly and rapidly alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem, the need for predictive
models that enable understanding of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial.
Analytical models often use simple, linear components of ecosystems, such as food chains, and are know
