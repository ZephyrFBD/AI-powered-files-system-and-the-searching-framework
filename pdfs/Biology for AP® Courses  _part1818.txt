 location. The binding of additional regulatory transcription factors to cis-acting elements
will either increase or prevent transcription. In addition to promoter sequences, enhancer regions help augment
transcription. Enhancers can be upstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other chromosomes. Transcription
factors bind to enhancer regions to increase or prevent transcription.
16.5 Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation
Post-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA
stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This
involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron
border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together. Once this occurs, the RNA is mature and can be translated.
RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be transported to t
