ii. Survival of individuals within a population will depend on their phenotype. Individuals with traits
that promote survival will be more likely to pass these traits to offspring, allowing them to survive
to reproduce and thus be more “fit.” The traits that make them more “fit” are said to give them a
selective advantage.
iv. Over time, the fittest organisms will survive, hence “survival of the fittest,” and therefore more
individuals in the population will be born with the advantageous phenotype.
The result of natural selection is the adaption of populations to their environment, thus giving
them a competitive advantage to survive.
v. A genetic variation, such as the average beak length of a finch that changes based on the year, is
an example of adaption. A finch population has a variety of beak lengths (phenotypes) due to
genetic mutations that exist in the population. Therefore, from the data that follows, we see that
during some years, the average beak length of the finches is lon
