ry that are consistent with a
neutral effect on free energy availability and provide your

E. Analyze the long-term effect of a rate of respiration that
exceeds the rate of photosynthesis in terms of dynamic
homeostasis.
111. A disruption of dynamic homeostasis in the
relationship between vascular plants and insects is
occurring as global climate changes. The reduction in the
yield of soybeans is plotted against leaf area removed by
two insects, beetles and aphids. Soybean blooms begin to
develop in the week of 13 July. Prior to that time, there is
no effect of leaf removal on yield, even with complete loss
of leaves. In the week of 18 August, plants are beginning
to form seeds, and loss of leaves can be devastating.

A. One observed effect of climate change is the shift
toward earlier development in many insects.
Quantitatively describe the worst possible consequences
for yield, assuming plant developmental timing is not
altered by warming temperatur
