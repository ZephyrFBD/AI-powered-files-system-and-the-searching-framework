e back into the plasma. Some CO2, however,
does not become HCO3âˆ’; instead, it
 
mixes directly with the plasma (as CO2gas) or binds with the amino groups
 
of the hemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells.
9. Bulk flow of air into and out of the lungs (mechanics of respiration). Air is moved into and out of the lungs by
changing their volume. The volume of the lungs is increased by the contraction of the diaphragm (a muscle under
the lungs) and the intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs). When the lung volume increases, the air pressure
within the lungs decreases. This causes a pressure difference between the air in the lungs and the air outside the
body. As a result, air rushes into the lungs by bulk flow. When the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the
volume of the lungs decreases, raising the pressure on the air, causing the air to rush out.
10. Control of respiration. Chemoreceptors in the carotid arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain) monitor
the pH of
