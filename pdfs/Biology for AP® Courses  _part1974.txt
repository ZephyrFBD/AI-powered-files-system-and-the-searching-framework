ips the availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each
generation. Both Darwin and Wallaceâ€™s understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist
Thomas Malthus who discussed this principle in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in
regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited
characteristics which allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those
individuals with variations that are less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better
represented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin
called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local
environment; it is the only mechanism k
