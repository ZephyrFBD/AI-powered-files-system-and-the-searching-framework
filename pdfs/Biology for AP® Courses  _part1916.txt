Proteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed
of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to
affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as
hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In
the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a
specific protein.
A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of
genomes because genes code for mR
