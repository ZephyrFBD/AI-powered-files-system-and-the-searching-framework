 15.63 How do the following changes affect the value of the 
equilibrium constant for a gas-phase exothermic reac-
tion: (a) removal of a reactant, (b) removal of a product, 
(c) decrease in the volume, (d) decrease in the tempera-
ture, (e) addition of a catalyst?
 15.64 For a certain gas-phase reaction, the fraction of products 
in an equilibrium mixture is increased by either increas-
ing the temperature or by increasing the volume of the 
reaction vessel. (a) Is the reaction exothermic or endo-
thermic? (b) Does the balanced chemical equation have 
more molecules on the reactant side or product side?
 15.65 Consider the following equilibrium between oxides of 
nitrogen
3 NO1g2 ∆ NO21g2 + N2O1g2
 
 (a) Use data in Appendix C to calculate ∆H° for this reaction. 
(b) Will the equilibrium constant for the reaction increase or 
decrease with increasing temperature? (c) At constant tem-
perature, would a change in the volume of the container 
affect the fraction of pro
