A will be passed onto daughter cells, which can be disastrous. When damaged DNA is found, checkpoints are
activated and cell cycle progression stops. The cell uses the extra time to repair damage in DNA. If the DNA
damage is so extensive that it cannot be repaired, the cell can undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death.
Apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun, so it is a highly regulated process. It is an important part of normal cell
turnover in multicellular organisms.
Cell cycle checkpoints control cell cycle progression by regulating two families of proteins: cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDKs) and cyclins. To induce cell cycle progression, an inactive CDK binds a regulatory cyclin. Once
together, the complex is activated, can affect many proteins in the cell, and causes the cell cycle to continue. To
inhibit cell cycle progression, CDKs and cyclins are kept separate. CDKs and cyclins were first studied in yeast,
unicellular eukaryotic fungi. Budding yeast and fission yeast were good
