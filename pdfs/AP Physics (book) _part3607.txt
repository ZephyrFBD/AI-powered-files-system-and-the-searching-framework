Width

The width of a resonance—in Fig. 32–14 the full width of the 
peak at half
the maximum is on the order of 100 MeV—is an interesting application of the
uncertainty principle. If a particle lives only 
then its mass (i.e., its rest
energy) will be uncertain by an amount
which is what is observed. Actually, the lifetimes of
for such resonances
are inferred by the reverse process: from the measured width being

Towards a New Model
In the early 1950s, the newly found particles K,
and 
were found to behave
rather strangely in two ways. First, they were always produced in pairs. For
example, the reaction
occurred with high probability, but the similar reaction 
was
never observed to occur even though it did not violate any known conservation law.
The second feature of these strange particles, as they came to be called, was that
they were produced via the strong interaction (that is, at a high interaction rate),
