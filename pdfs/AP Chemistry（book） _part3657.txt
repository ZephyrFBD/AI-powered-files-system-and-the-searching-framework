ides as Fe2O3, LaFeO3, and MnO.
A substance that exhibits ferrimagnetism [Figure 23.6(d)] has both ferromagnetic 
and antiferromagnetic characteristics. Like an antiferromagnet, the unpaired electrons 
align so that the spins in adjacent atoms or ions point in opposite directions. However, 
unlike an antiferromagnet, the net magnetic moments of the spin-up electrons are not 
fully canceled by the spin-down electrons. This can happen because the magnetic cen-
ters have different numbers of unpaired electrons (NiMnO3), because the number of 
magnetic sites aligned in one direction is larger than the number aligned in the other 
direction (Y
3Fe5O12), or because both of these conditions apply (Fe3O4). Because the mag-
netic moments do not cancel, the properties of ferrimagnetic materials are similar to the 
properties of ferromagnetic materials.
