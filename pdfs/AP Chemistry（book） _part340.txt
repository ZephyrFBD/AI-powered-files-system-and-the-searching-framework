ance the charge of one Cl-. (The name hydrogen chloride is used only for 
the pure compound; water solutions of HCl are called hydrochloric acid. The distinction, 
which is important, will be explained in Section 4.1.) Similarly, the formula for hydrogen 
sulfide is H2S because two H+ ions are needed to balance the charge on S2-.

2.9 âˆ£ Some Simple Organic Compounds
The study of compounds of carbon is called organic chemistry, and as noted earlier, 
compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen, often in combination with oxygen, ni-
trogen, or other elements, are called organic compounds. Organic compounds are a very 
important part of chemistry, far outnumbering all other types of chemical substances. 
We will examine organic compounds in a systematic way in Chapter 24
