 Estimate the initial speed of that
car assuming a level road.
45. (II) Drag-race tires in contact with an asphalt surface 
have a very high coefficient of static friction. Assuming a
constant acceleration and no slipping of tires, estimate 
the coefficient of static friction needed for a drag racer to
cover 1.0 km in 12 s, starting from rest.
46. (II) For the system of Fig. 4–32 (Example 4–20), how large
a mass would box A have to have to prevent any motion
from occurring? Assume ms = 0.30.
3.6 * 103 N
3.5 ms?
0.60 ms2.

50. (II) A person pushes a 14.0-kg lawn mower at constant
speed with a force of
directed along the handle,
which is at an angle of 45.0° to the horizontal (Fig. 4–58).
(a) Draw the free-body diagram showing all forces acting
on the mower. Calculate (b) the horizontal friction force
on the mower, then (c) the normal force exerted vertically
upward on the mower by the ground. (d) What force 
must the person exert on the lawn mower to accelerate it
from rest to
