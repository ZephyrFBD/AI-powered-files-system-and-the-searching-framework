e of life, and that it’s
changing the way we think about prevention and treatment of
disease’:
In every cell there’s this thing called messenger RNA, or mRNA for short, that transmits the
critical information from the DNA in our genes to the protein, which is really the stuff we’re
all made out of. This is the critical information that determines what the cell will do. So we
think about it as an operating system. So if you could change that, if you could introduce a
line of code, or change a line of code, it turns out, that has profound implications for
everything, from the flu to cancer.
Zaks should more accurately have said that this has profound
implications for the human genetic code and the nature of DNA.
Communications within the body go both ways and not only one.
But, hey, no, the ‘Covid vaccine’ will not aﬀect your genetics. Cult
fact-checkers say so even though the man who helped to develop the
mRNA technique says that it does. Zaks said in 2017:
If you think about what it is
