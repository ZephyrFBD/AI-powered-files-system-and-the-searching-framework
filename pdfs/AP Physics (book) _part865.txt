ular velocity,
is defined as the rate of change of
angular position:
(8;2)
All parts of a rigid object rotating about a fixed axis have the
same angular velocity at any instant.
Angular acceleration,
is defined as the rate of change of
angular velocity:
(8;3)
The linear velocity v and acceleration a of a point located
a distance r from the axis of rotation are related to 
and 
by
(8;4)
(8;5)
(8;6)
where 
and 
are the tangential and radial (centripetal)
components of the linear acceleration, respectively.
The frequency f is related to 
by
(8;7)
and to the period T by
(8;8)
If a rigid object undergoes uniformly accelerated rotational
motion 
equations analogous to those for linear
motion are valid:
(8;9)
The torque due to a force 
exerted on a rigid object is
equal to
(8;10)
where 
called the lever arm, is the perpendicular distance
from the axis of rotation to the line along which the force acts,
and is the angle between 
and r.
