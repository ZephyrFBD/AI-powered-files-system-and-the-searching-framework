o align tangent to a circle around the wire,
Fig. 20–8a. Thus, the magnetic field lines produced by a current in a straight wire
are in the form of circles with the wire at their center, Figs.20–8b and c. The direction
of these lines is indicated by the north pole of the compasses in Fig. 20–8a.
There is a simple way to remember the direction of the magnetic field lines in this
case. It is called a right-hand rule: grasp the wire with your right hand so that your
thumb points in the direction of the conventional (positive) current; then your
fingers will encircle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field, Fig. 20–8d.
The magnetic field lines due to a circular loop of current-carrying wire can be
determined in a similar way by placing a compass at various locations near the
loop. The result is shown in Fig. 20–9. Again the right-hand rule can be used, as
shown in Fig. 20–10. Unlike the uniform field shown in Fig. 20–7, the magnetic
fields shown in Figs. 20–8 and 20–9 are not unifo
