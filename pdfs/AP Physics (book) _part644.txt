that retards the motion, with the force 
needed to accel-
erate the car, which is the frictional force exerted by the road on the tires—the
reaction to the motor-driven tires pushing against the road. We must determine
the magnitude of the force F before calculating the power.
SOLUTION (a) To move at a steady speed up the hill, the car must, by New-
ton’s second law, exert a force F equal to the sum of the retarding force, 700 N,
and the component of gravity parallel to the hill, mg sin 10°, Fig. 6–29. Thus
Since
† and is parallel to 
then (Eq. 6–18) the power is
(b) The car accelerates from 
to 
(90 to 
) on the flat.
The car must exert a force that overcomes the 700-N retarding force plus that
required to give it the acceleration
We apply Newton’s second law with x being the horizontal direction of motion
(no component of gravity):
We solve for the force required,
Since  
the required power increases with speed and the motor must be
able to provide a maximum power output in this case
