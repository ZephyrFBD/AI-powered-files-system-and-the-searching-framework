3. (I) A laser beam is directed at the Moon, 380,000 km from
Earth. The beam diverges at an angle

11. (II) What is the linear speed, due to the Earth’s rotation,
of a point (a) on the equator, (b) on the Arctic Circle 
(latitude 66.5° N), and (c) at a latitude of 42.0° N?
12. (II) Calculate the angular velocity of the Earth (a) in its
orbit around the Sun, and (b) about its axis.
13. (II) How fast (in rpm) must a centrifuge rotate if a particle
8.0 cm from the axis of rotation is to experience an accel-
eration of 100,000 g’s?
14. (II) A 61-cm-diameter wheel accelerates uniformly about its
center from 120 rpm to 280 rpm in 4.0 s. Determine (a) its
angular acceleration, and (b) the radial and tangential
components of the linear acceleration of a point on the edge
of the wheel 2.0 s after it has started accelerating.
