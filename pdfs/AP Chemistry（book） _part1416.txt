t, as is the case for hybrid orbitals. The hybrid 
orbital model for period 2 elements has proven very useful and is an essential part of any 
modern discussion of bonding and molecular geometry in organic chemistry. When it 
comes to molecules such as SF6, however, we encounter the limitations of the model.
Hybrid Orbital Summary
Overall, hybrid orbitals provide a convenient model for using valence-bond theory 
to describe covalent bonds in molecules that have an octet or less of electrons around

the central atom and in which the molecular geometry conforms to the electron- 
domain geometry predicted by the VSEPR model. While the concept of hybrid orbitals 
has  
limited predictive value, when we know the electron-domain geometry, we can em-
ploy hybridization to describe the atomic orbitals used by the central atom in bonding.
