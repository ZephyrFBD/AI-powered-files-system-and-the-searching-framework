 months. When P. bursaria swims into the light, the
chloroplasts it swallowed perform photosynthesis, supplying food to the paramecium. This process is called kleptoplasty (klepto- means “to steal”).
Next is a discussion of how compartmentalization in cells increases their efficiency.
The Advantages of Compartmentalization
Membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells allow different parts of the cells to specialize their functions, and
this specialization allows for greater efficiency within the cell. These membrane-bound organelles form specialized
compartments. This compartmentalization allows the cell to separate the enzymes involved in different metabolic
processes. By separating these metabolic processes, cells minimize the risk of enzymes and molecules from different
processes cross-reacting, which would make these processes less efficient and more difficult to regulate.
Some eukaryotic organelles have internal membranes that are folded (for example, the inner membrane of the
mi
