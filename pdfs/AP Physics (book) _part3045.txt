 theory, and especially
Einstein’s analysis of Brownian motion (see Section 13–1), the radius of atoms
was estimated to be about 
Thus the electrons would seem to be at a
distance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the radius of the
nucleus itself. (If the nucleus were the size of a baseball, the atom would have the
diameter of a big city several kilometers across.) So an atom would be mostly
empty space.
Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom (also called the nuclear model 
of the atom) was a major step toward how we view the atom today. It was not,
however, a complete model and presented some major problems, as we shall see.

1 Atomic Spectra: Key to the
Structure of the Atom
Earlier in this Chapter we saw that heated solids (as well as liquids and dense gases)
emit light with a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. This radiation is assumed to
be due to oscillations of atoms and molecules, which are largely governed by the
interaction of each atom or molecule with
