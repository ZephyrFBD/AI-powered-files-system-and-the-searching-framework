s. generation number 
•  Number of rabbits vs. generation number 
•  A combination of the two graphs (i.e., with two y-axes) to see coupled oscillations 
•  A graph of foxes versus rabbits to examine/observe cycles

Some questions that you might pursue with students include the following: 
1. What is the sensitivity to different initial conditions? (That is, starting with different 
numbers of foxes and rabbits, what is the impact of slightly perturbing the system?) 
2. If you start with the same numbers as in your first experiment, do your results look 
the same? 
3. In reality, some rabbits and foxes may die, or be infertile for other reasons. Should 
we treat such factors as random or not? How might we incorporate them into the 
game versus in the model? 
4. In general, how can we modify the above equations to make a model with the 
realistic outcomes of the board game? 
5. How does the model change if the
