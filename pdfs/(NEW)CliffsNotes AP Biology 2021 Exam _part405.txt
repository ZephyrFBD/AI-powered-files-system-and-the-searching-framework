ve lichens, exposing the dark tree bark below. As
a result, the dark form of the moth became the better camouflaged of the two forms, and increased in frequency. A
hundred years after the first dark moth was discovered in 1848, 90% of the moths were dark colored. Meanwhile,
the light form of the moth continued to dominate populations in unpolluted areas outside London. The selection of
dark-colored (melanic) varieties in various species of moths as a result of industrial pollution is called industrial
melanism. It is an example of how changes in environmental conditions promote evolution.
As a result of global climate change, many habitats are experiencing season creep, the shortening of winters and
earlier arrivals of spring. In response, there is selection for plants that germinate and flower earlier. In general,
invasive plant species appear to be favored.
3. Disruptive selection (or diversifying selection) occurs when the environment favors extreme or unusual traits,
