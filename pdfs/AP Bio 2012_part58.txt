s the absence of the indicated substance in the culture media 
 
  Which of the following can best be used to justify why the GFP is expressed by E. coli cells after transformation 
with the plasmid? 
(A) The presence of arabinose in the nutrient agar activated the expression of the genes located downstream of 
the ara operon regulatory sequences. 
(B) The combination of ampicillin and arabinose in the nutrient agar inhibited the expression of certain gene 
products, resulting in the increased expression of the GFP. 
(C) The nutrient agar without arabinose but with ampicillin activated the expression of the genes located 
downstream of the ara operon regulatory sequences. 
(D) Both arabinose and ampicillin were required in the nutrient agar to activate the expression of genes located 
downstream of the ara operon regulatory sequences.
