ency in search of an explanation for
transmission. She said the Moderna and Pﬁzer ‘vaccines’ contained
nano-lipid particles as a key component. This was a brand new
technology never before used on humanity. ‘They’re using a
nanotechnology which is preĴy much liĴle tiny computer bits …
nanobots or hydrogel.’ Inside the ‘vaccines’ was ‘this sci-ﬁ kind of
substance’ which suppressed immune checkpoints to get into the
cell. I referred to this earlier as the ‘Trojan horse’ technique that
tricks the cell into opening a gateway for the self-replicating
synthetic material and while the immune system is artiﬁcially
suppressed the body has no defences. Madej said the substance
served many purposes including an on-demand ability to ‘deliver
the payload’ and using the nano ‘computer bits’ as biosensors in the
body. ‘It actually has the ability to accumulate data from your body,
like your breathing, your respiration, thoughts, emotions, all kinds
of things.’
She said the technology obviously has th
