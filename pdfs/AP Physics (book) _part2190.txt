of wire exposed to the magnetic
field. The force also depends on the angle between the current direction and the
magnetic field (Fig. 20–12), being proportional to 
Thus, the force on a wire
carrying a current I with length in a uniform magnetic field B is given by
When the current is perpendicular to the field lines 
and
the
force is strongest. When the wire is parallel to the magnetic field lines 
there is no force at all.
Up to now we have not defined the magnetic field strength precisely. In fact,
the magnetic field B can be conveniently defined in terms of the above propor-
tion so that the proportionality constant is precisely 1. Thus we have
(20;1)
If the current’s direction is perpendicular to the field 
then the force is
(20;2)
(If B is not uniform, then B in Eqs. 20–1 and 20–2 can be the average field over
the length of the wire.)
The magnitude of 
can be defined using Eq. 20–2 as
where
is the magnitude of the force on a straight length 
of wire carrying a 
current I when the
