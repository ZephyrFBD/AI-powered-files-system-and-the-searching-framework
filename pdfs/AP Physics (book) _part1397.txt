ury in the right-hand column is then a measure
of the temperature. This thermometer gives the same results for all gases in the
limit of reducing the gas pressure in the bulb toward zero. The resulting scale
serves as a basis for the standard temperature scale.

13–3 Thermal Equilibrium and the
Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
If two objects at different temperatures are placed in thermal contact (meaning
thermal energy can transfer from one to the other), the two objects will eventually
reach the same temperature. They are then said to be in thermal equilibrium. For
example, you leave a fever thermometer in your mouth until it comes into thermal
equilibrium with that environment; then you read it. Two objects are defined 
to be in thermal equilibrium if, when placed in thermal contact, no net energy
flows from one to the other, and their temperatures don’t change.
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
Experiments indicate that
if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, the
