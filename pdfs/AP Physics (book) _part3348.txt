 this results in radioac-
tive decay. Before we discuss the important subject of radioactivity (next Section),
we note that there is a second type of nuclear force that is much weaker than the
strong nuclear force. It is called the weak nuclear force, and we are aware of its
existence only because it shows itself in certain types of radioactive decay. These
two nuclear forces, the strong and the weak, together with the gravitational and
electromagnetic forces, comprise the four fundamental types of force in nature.
30–3 Radioactivity
Nuclear physics had its beginnings in 1896. In that year, Henri Becquerel
(1852–1908) made an important discovery: in his studies of phosphorescence, he
found that a certain mineral (which happened to contain uranium) would darken
a photographic plate even when the plate was wrapped to exclude light. It was
clear that the mineral emitted some new kind of radiation that, unlike X-rays
(Section 25–11), occurred without any external stimulus. This new phenome
