then the contraction could occur at any time,

Dehydration is loss of water. Synthesis is building something. This is a common type of reaction during
the polymerization of macromolecules.

B
Human shivering is the result of negative feedback since a stimulus caused something to occur that
reversed/stopped the original situation; the body temperature went up when there was a stimulus of a low
body temperature. Choice (B) is another example of negative feedback as blood sugar is lowered when
the level gets too high. All other choices are examples of positive feedback as they lead to a stimulus
getting continued and amplified.

C
ADP has two phosphates. If it is dephosphorylated, then it would be AMP, which has one phosphate. If it
