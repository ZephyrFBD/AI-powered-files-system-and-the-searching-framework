n 4.11 is
H+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 + Na+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ¡  
 
H2O1l2 + Na+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 
[4.12]
Therefore, the net ionic equation is
 
H+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 ¡ H2O1l2 
[4.13]
Equation 4.13 summarizes the main feature of the neutralization reaction between any 
strong acid and any strong base: H+1aq2 and OH-1aq2 ions combine to form H2O1l2.
Figure 4.9 shows the neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid and the 
water-insoluble base Mg1OH22:
Molecular equation:
 
Mg1OH221s2 + 2 HCl1aq2 ¡ MgCl21aq2 + 2 H2O1l2 
[4.14]
Net ionic equation:
 
Mg1OH221s2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ Mg2+1aq2 + 2 H2O1l2 
[4.15]
Notice that the OH- ions (this time in a solid reactant) and H+ ions combine to form H2O. 
Because the ions exchange partners, neutralization reactions between acids and metal hy-
droxides are metathesis reactions.
