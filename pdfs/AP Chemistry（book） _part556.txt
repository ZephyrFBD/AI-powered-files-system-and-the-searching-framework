queous solution, it is often useful to indicate 
whether the dissolved substances are present predominantly as ions or as molecules. 
Let’s reconsider the precipitation reaction between Pb1NO322 and 2 KI (Eq. 4.3):
Pb(NO3221aq2 + 2 KI1aq2 ¡ PbI21s2 + 2 KNO31aq2
An equation written in this fashion, showing the complete chemical formulas of reac-
tants and products, is called a molecular equation because it shows chemical formulas 
without indicating ionic character. Because Pb(NO322, KI, and KNO3 are all water-soluble 
ionic compounds and therefore strong electrolytes, we can write the equation in a form 
that indicates which species exist as ions in the solution:
 
Pb2+1aq2 + 2 NO3
-1aq2 + 2 K+1aq2 + 2 I-1aq2 ¡  
 
PbI21s2 + 2 K+1aq2 + 2 NO3
-1aq2 
[4.6]
An equation written in this form, with all soluble strong electrolytes shown as ions, is 
called a complete ionic equation.
Notice that K+1aq2 and NO3
-1aq2 appear on both sides of Equation 4.6. Ions that 
appear in identical forms on
