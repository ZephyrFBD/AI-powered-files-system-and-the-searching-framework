ing plasmids, which are small, circular DNA fragments that
can serve as a vector to incorporate genes into the hostâ€™s chromosome. Plasmids are key elements in genetic
engineering. The concepts you need to know about plasmids include the following:
One way to incorporate specific genes into a plasmid is to use restriction enzymes, which cut foreign DNA at
specific sites, producing DNA fragments. A specific fragment can be mixed together with a plasmid, and this
recombinant plasmid can then be taken up by E. coli.
Plasmids can give a transformed cell selective advantage. For example, if a plasmid carries genes that confer
resistance to an antibiotic like ampicillin, it can transfer these genes to the bacteria. These bacteria are then said
to be transformed. That means if ampicillin is in the culture, only transformed cells will grow. This is a clever
way scientists can find out which bacteria have taken up a plasmid.
In order to make a bacteria cell take up a plasmid, you must (1) add Ca
