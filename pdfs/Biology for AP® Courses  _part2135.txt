 selection works by selecting for
phenotypes—and the alleles that determine them—that confer beneficial traits or behaviors. Deleterious qualities are
selected against. Genetic drift stems from the chance occurrence that some individuals have more offspring than others and,
thus, will pass on more of their genes to the next generation. Small and isolated populations are more susceptible to genetic
drift. Natural events, such as wildfires or hurricanes, can magnify genetic drift when a large portion of the population is
killed. Because a fire does not distinguish between the genotypes of various organisms, no particular genotype survives
the fire better than another. Therefore, the genetic structure of the surviving population may be very different from the
genetic structure of the original population. This is called the bottleneck effect. Another scenario in which populations
might experience a strong influence of genetic drift occurs when some portion of the population leaves to start
