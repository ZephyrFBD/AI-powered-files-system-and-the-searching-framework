, have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are
made to the surrounding atoms, especially in carbon-to-carbon double bonds. In the simple molecule butene (C4H8), the
two methyl groups (CH3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule, as illustrated in figureb.
When the carbons are bound on the same side of the double bond, this is the cis configuration; if they are on opposite sides
of the double bond, it is a trans configuration. In the trans configuration, the carbons form a more or less linear structure,
whereas the carbons in the cis configuration make a bend (change in direction) of the carbon backbone.

Figure 2.26 Molecules that have the same number and type of atoms arranged differently are called isomers.
(a) Structural isomers have a different covalent arrangement of atoms. (b) Geometric isomers have a different
arrangement of atoms around a double bond. (c) Enanti
