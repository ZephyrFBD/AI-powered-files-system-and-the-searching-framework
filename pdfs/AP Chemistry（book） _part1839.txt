nomaterials. Polymers contain long chains of atoms 
(usually carbon), where the atoms within a given chain are connected by covalent bonds 
and adjacent chains are held to one another largely by weaker intermolecular forces. 
 
Polymers are normally stronger and have higher melting points than molecular solids, 
and they are more flexible than metallic, ionic, or covalent-network  
solids. Nanomate-
rials are solids in which the dimensions of individual crystals have been reduced to the 
order of 1–100 nm. As we will see, the properties of conventional materials change when 
their crystals become this small.
Metallic solids
Extended networks of atoms held
together by metallic bonding (Cu, Fe)
Ionic solids
Extended networks of ions held together
by cation–anion interactions (NaCl, MgO)
Covalent-network solids
Extended networks of atoms held
together by covalent bonds (C, Si)
Molecular solids
Discrete molecules held together by
intermolecular forces (HBr, H2O)
