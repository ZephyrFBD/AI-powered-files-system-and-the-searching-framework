 of electromagnetic radiation have different properties? Their 
differences are due to their different wavelengths. Figure 6.4 shows the various types of 
electromagnetic radiation arranged in order of increasing wavelength, a display called 
the electromagnetic spectrum. Notice that the wavelengths span an enormous range. The 
wavelengths of gamma rays are comparable to the diameters of atomic nuclei, whereas the 
wavelengths of radio waves can be longer than a football field. Notice also that visible light, 
which corresponds to wavelengths of about 400 to 750 nm 14 *  
10 - 7 to 7 * 10 - 7 m2, is 
an extremely small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The unit of length chosen to 
express wavelength depends on the type of radiation, as shown in Table 6.1.
Frequency is expressed in cycles per second, a unit also called a hertz (Hz). 
Because it is understood that cycles are involved, the units of frequency are normally 
given  
simply as “per second,” which is denoted by s - 1 o
