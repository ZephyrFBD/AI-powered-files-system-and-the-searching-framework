[7.113] When magnesium metal is burned in air (Figure 3.6), two 
products are produced. One is magnesium oxide, MgO. The 
other is the product of the reaction of Mg with molecular 
nitrogen, magnesium nitride. When water is added to mag-
nesium nitride, it reacts to form magnesium oxide and am-
monia gas. (a) Based on the charge of the nitride ion (Table 
2.5), predict the formula of magnesium nitride. (b) Write a 
balanced equation for the reaction of magnesium nitride 
with water. What is the driving force for this reaction? (c) In 
an experiment, a piece of magnesium ribbon is burned in air 
in a crucible. The mass of the mixture of MgO and magne-
sium nitride after burning is 0.470 g. Water is added to the 
crucible, further reaction occurs, and the crucible is heated to 
dryness until the Ô¨Ånal product is 0.486 g of MgO. What was 
the mass percentage of magnesium nitride in the mixture ob-
tained after
