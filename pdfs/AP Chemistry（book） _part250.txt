Washington University reported the preparation of a new 
“spongy” material composed of nickel, molybdenum, and 
sulfur that excels at removing mercury from water. The den-
sity of this new material is 0.20 g>cm3, and its surface area is 
1242 m2 per gram of material. (a) Calculate the volume of a 
10.0-mg sample of this material. (b) Calculate the surface area for 
a 10.0-mg sample of this material. (c) A 10.0-mL sample of con-
taminated water had 7.748 mg of mercury in it. After treatment 
with 10.0 mg of the new spongy material, 0.001 mg of mercury 
remained in the contaminated water. What percentage of the 
mercury was removed from the water? (d) What is the final mass 
of the spongy material after the exposure to mercury?
