1.4 The student can use representations and models to analyze situations or solve problems
qualitatively and quantitatively.
Learning
Objective
2.12 The student is able to use representations and models to analyze situations or solve
problems qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate whether dynamic homeostasis is
maintained by the active movement of molecules across membranes.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure
