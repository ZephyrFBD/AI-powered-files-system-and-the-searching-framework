so it canâ€™t build up a high voltage.

capacitance is __________ the smallest capacitance; when
capacitors are connected in parallel, the effective capaci-
tance is __________ the largest capacitance.

15. If ammeters and voltmeters are not to significantly alter the
quantities they are measuring,
(a) the resistance of an ammeter and a voltmeter should be
much higher than that of the circuit element being
measured.
(b) the resistance of an ammeter should be much lower,
and the resistance of a voltmeter should be much
higher, than those of the circuit being measured.
(c) the resistance of an ammeter should be much higher,
and the resistance of a voltmeter should be much
lower, than those of the circuit being measured.
(d) the resistance of an ammeter and a voltmeter should
be much lower than that of
