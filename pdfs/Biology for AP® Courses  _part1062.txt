te the release of toxins that will attack the host. Bacterial biofilms
(Figure 9.18) can sometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee
replacements or heart pacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections.
The ability of certain bacteria to form biofilms has evolved because of a selection of genes that enable cell-cell
communication confers an evolutionary advantage. When bacterial colonies form biofilms, they create barriers that prevent
toxins and antibacterial drugs from affecting the population living in the biofilm. As a result, these populations are more
likely to survive, even in the presence of antibacterial agents. This often means that bacteria living in biofilms have higher
fitness than bacteria living on their own.

Why is signaling in multicellular organisms more complicated than signaling in single-celled organisms such as
microbes?
