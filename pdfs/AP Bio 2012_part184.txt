the disruption(s).
(Part b) The student is able to describe one to two 
consequences of viral infection on individual plants but 
cannot justify the predictions. For example, the student 
states that the infected plant can die but does not give a 
reason for the consequence.

(Part c) The student is able to explain how a decrease in the 
amount of grass due to infection affects the energy dynamics 
of the prairie community; that is, a change in the producer 
trophic level affects the consumer level(s). The student is 
able to describe 1â€“2 adverse consequences of short-term 
change due to infection on the plant population and prairie 
community but provides limited or no justification for the 
predictions. The student likely does not consider possible 
positive effects to the prairie community. 
(Part d) The student is able to predict one to two adverse 
consequences of long-term change due to infection on 
the plant population and prairie community but provi
