Scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size. We also know
that bacteria have DNA and ribosomes, just as mitochondria and chloroplasts do. Scientists believe that
host cells and bacteria formed an endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and
autotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) but did not destroy them. Through many millions of years of evolution,
these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming
mitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.
Based on what you know about plant and animals cells, which of the following events are most likely to have occurred?
a.
A host cell that ingested aerobic bacteria gave rise to modern animals, while ancestor of that cell that also
ingested photoautotrophic bacteria that gave rise to modern plants.
b.
A host cell that gave rise to modern plants ingested photoautotrophic bacteria only, while a ho
