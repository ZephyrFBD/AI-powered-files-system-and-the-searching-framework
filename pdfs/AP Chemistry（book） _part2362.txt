ch you can displace the water by bailing it out. At that point, a 
state of dynamic equilibrium is reached, where the rates of the forward 
process (water coming into the boat) and the reverse process (water leav-
ing the boat) are equal to each other and the level of water in the boat 
remains constant.
A somewhat analogous situation occurs when heavy rains fall in 
coastal cities that are partially below sea level, like New Orleans (Fig-
ure 15.1). The saucer-shaped elevation profile of New Orleans means 
that water cannot naturally drain away from the lower parts of the city.

To be in equilibrium is to be in a 
state of balance. A tug of war in which the two 
sides pull with equal force so that the rope does 
not move is an example of a static equilibrium, 
one in which an object is at rest. Equilibria can 
also be dynamic, whereby a forward process and 
the reverse process take place at the same rate so 
that no net change occurs.
