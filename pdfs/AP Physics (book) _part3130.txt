for observing an electron with a
powerful light microscope. At least
one photon must scatter from the
electron (transferring some
momentum to it) and enter the
microscope.

EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Another useful form of the uncertainty principle relates energy and time,
and we examine this as follows. The object to be detected has an uncertainty in
position 
The photon that detects it travels with speed c, and it takes a
time 
to pass through the distance of uncertainty. Hence, the
measured time when our object is at a given position is uncertain by about
Since the photon can transfer some or all of its energy 
to our
object, the uncertainty in energy of our object as a result is
The product of these two uncertainties is
