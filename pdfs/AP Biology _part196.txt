tion is critical. The end
product, pyruvate, is the raw material for the Krebs cycle, which is the
next step in aerobic respiration. Without glycolysis to yield pyruvate,
aerobic respiration could not occur.
During 
glycolysis, 
ATP 
is 
produced 
by 
substrate 
level
phosphorylation—by direct enzymatic transfer of a phosphate to ADP
(remember kinases from Chapter 4). Only a small amount of ATP is
released this way.
There is one other important thing about glycolysis. The enzyme that
catalyzes the third step, phosphofructokinase (PFK), is an allosteric
enzyme. It inhibits glycolysis when the cell contains enough ATP and does
not need to produce any more. If ATP is present in the cell in large
quantities, it inhibits PFK by altering the conformation of that enzyme,
thus stopping glycolysis.

This makes sense because as the cell’s activities use up ATP, less ATP
is available to inhibit PFK and glycolysis continues, ulti
