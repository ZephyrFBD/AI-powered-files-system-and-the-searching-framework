zero is the lowest temperature attainable. It has the value 0 K. A derived unit 
is obtained by multiplication or division of SI base units. Derived units are 
needed for defined quantities such as speed or volume. Density is an im-
portant derived unit that equals mass divided by volume.
UNCERTAINTY IN MEASUREMENT (SECTION 1.6) All measured 
quantities are inexact to some extent. The precision of a measurement 
indicates how closely different measurements of a quantity agree 
with one another. The accuracy of a measurement indicates how well 
a measurement agrees with the accepted or “true” value. The signifi-
cant figures in a measured quantity include one estimated digit, the 
last digit of the measurement. The significant figures indicate the 
extent of the uncertainty of the measurement. Certain rules must 
be followed so that a calculation involving measured quantities is re-
ported with the appropriate number of significant figures.
