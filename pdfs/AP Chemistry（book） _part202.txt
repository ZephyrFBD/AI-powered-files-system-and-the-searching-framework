nd 1 L = 10-3 m3, but there is  
no relationship listed involving km3. From our knowledge of SI 
prefixes, however, we know 1 km = 103 m and we can use this  
relationship between lengths to write the desired conversion  
factor between volumes:
a 103 m
1 km b
3
= 109 m3
1 km3
Thus, converting from km3 to m3 to L, we have
Volume in liters = 11.36 * 109 km32a 109 m3

= 1.36 * 1021 L
How many liters of water do Earth’s oceans contain?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A barrel of oil as measured on the oil market is equal to 1.333 
U.S. barrels. A U.S. barrel is equal to 31.5 gal. If oil is on the 
market at $94.0 per barrel, what is the price in dollars per 
gallon? 
(a) $2.24/gal (b) $3.98/gal (c) $2.98/gal (d) $1.05/gal  
(e) $8.42/gal
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The surface area of Earth is 510 * 106 km2, and 71% of this is 
ocean. Using the data from the sample exercise, calculate the 
average depth of the world’s oceans in feet.
