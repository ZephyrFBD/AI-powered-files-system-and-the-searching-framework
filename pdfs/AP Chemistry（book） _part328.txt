Polyatomic anions containing oxygen have names ending in either -ate or -ite and 
are called oxyanions. The -ate is used for the most common or representative

oxyanion of an element, and -ite is used for an oxyanion that has the same charge 
but one O atom fewer:
NO3
-
nitrate ion
SO4
2-
sulfate ion
NO2
-
nitrite ion
SO3
2-
sulfite ion
Prefixes are used when the series of oxyanions of an element extends to four members, 
as with the halogens. The prefix per- indicates one more O atom than the oxyanion 
ending in -ate; hypo- indicates one O atom fewer than the oxyanion ending in -ite:
ClO4
-
perchlorate ion (one more O atom than chlorate)
ClO3
-
chlorate ion
ClO2
-
chlorite ion (one O atom fewer than chlorate)
ClO-
hypochlorite ion (one O atom fewer than chlorite)
These rules are summarized in Figure 2.23.
