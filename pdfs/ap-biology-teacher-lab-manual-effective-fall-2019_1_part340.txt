les that might be measured, questions should emerge about the process 
that leads to independent student investigations. 
One advantage of the floating disk technique is that the equipment and supplies 
required are inexpensive, so nearly every classroom environment can provide ample 
supplies for individual student investigations. 
Finally, students design and conduct an experiment(s) to investigate one or more 
questions that they raised in Procedure. Their exploration will likely generate even more 
questions about photosynthesis.

For students who try but are unable to develop questions of their own, consider the 
following supplemental prompts: 
•  What makes plants stop growing? Could any of these affect photosynthesis? 
•  Do all leaves look the same? What is different? Could these differences affect 
photosynthesis? 
The lab also provides an opportunity for students to apply, review, and/or scaffold 
concepts
