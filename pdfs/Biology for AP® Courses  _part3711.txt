ide of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to
the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in Figure 31.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it
is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one
atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers
that pump blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the
jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava
which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood
from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the
