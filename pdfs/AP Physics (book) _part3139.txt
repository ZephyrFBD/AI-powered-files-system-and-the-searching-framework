numbers of molecules are dealt with. We can say, then, that
although there are no precise deterministic laws in quantum mechanics, there are
statistical laws based on probability.
It is important to note that there is a difference between the probability
imposed by quantum mechanics and that used in the nineteenth century to
understand thermodynamics and the behavior of gases in terms of molecules
(Chapters 13 and 15). In thermodynamics, probability is used because there are
far too many particles to keep track of. But the molecules are still assumed to
move and interact in a deterministic way following Newton’s laws. Probability in
quantum mechanics is quite different; it is seen as inherent in nature, and not as a
limitation on our abilities to calculate or to measure.

†Note that these probabilities can be calculated precisely, just like predictions of probabilities at
rolling dice or dealing cards; but they are unlike predictions of probabil
