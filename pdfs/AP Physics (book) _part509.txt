astronauts experience so many g’s at a rocket’s launch.
If, instead, the elevator’s acceleration is 
(downward), then
That is, the scale reads half the actual weight. If the
elevator is in free fall (for example, if the cables break), then
and
The scale reads zero. See Fig. 5–24c. The bag appears weight-
less. If the person in the elevator accelerating at 
let go of a box, it would 
not fall to the floor. True, the box would be falling with acceleration g. But so
would the floor of the elevator and the person. The box would hover right 
in front of the person. This phenomenon is called apparent weightlessness
because in the reference frame of the person, objects don’t fall or seem to have
weight—yet gravity does not disappear. Gravity is still acting on each object,
whose weight is still mg.
