e approximate percentage of cells in G1 and G2.
6. (A)  Apoptosis is programmed cell death, and it can occur during embryonic development when the soft tissue
between the fingers dies to allow the fingers to separate. While choices (B), (C), and (D) also occur during
embryonic development, choice (A) is the best answer because it is the most specific to the formation of the
fingers during embryonic development.
7. (D)  Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm. Choice (A) is incorrect because apoptosis is programmed cell
death. DNA replication occurs during the S stage of the cell cycle, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is also
incorrect because mitosis is the process of evenly distributing replicated chromosomes between the daughter
nuclei.
8. (B)  Many somatic cells in organs and tissues exhibit density-dependent inhibition. Cancer cells do not exhibit
anchorage dependence nor do they exhibit density-dependent inhibition, so choices (A) and (D) are incorrect.
Choice (C) is i
