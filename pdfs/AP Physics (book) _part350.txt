 gases exert an equal and opposite force on the rocket. It is this
latter force that propels the rocket forward—the force exerted on the rocket by the
gases (see Chapter-Opening Photo, page 75). Thus, a space vehicle is maneuvered
in empty space by firing its rockets in the direction opposite to that in which it
needs to accelerate. When the rocket pushes on the gases in one direction, the
gases push back on the rocket in the opposite direction. Jet aircraft too accelerate
because the gases they thrust out backwards exert a forward force on the engines
(Newton’s third law).
Consider how we walk. A person begins walking by pushing with the foot
backward against the ground. The ground then exerts an equal and opposite
force forward on the person (Fig. 4–11), and it is this force, on the person, that
moves the person forward. (If you doubt this, try walking normally where there
is no friction, such as on very smooth slippery ice.) In a similar way, a bird flies
forward by exerting a backw
