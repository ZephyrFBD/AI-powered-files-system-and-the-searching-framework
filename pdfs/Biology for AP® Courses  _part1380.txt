To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual
probabilities together. The use of the word “or” suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule.
12.2 Characteristics and Traits
When true-breeding or homozygous individuals that differ for a certain trait are crossed, all of the offspring will be
heterozygotes for that trait. If the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the F1 offspring will all exhibit the same
phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting
F2 offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of
which one quarter are homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous recessive. Because
homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are phenotypically identical,
