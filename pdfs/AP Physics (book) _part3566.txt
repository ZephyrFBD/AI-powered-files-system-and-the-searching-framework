mall mass, get close to the speed of light quickly,
and the tubes are nearly equal in length. Linear accelerators are particularly impor-
tant for accelerating electrons to avoid loss of energy due to synchrotron radiation.
The largest electron linear accelerator has been at Stanford University (Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, or SLAC), about 3 km (2 mi) long, accelerating
electrons to 50 GeV. Linacs accelerating protons are used as injectors into circular
machines to provide initial kinetic energy. Many hospitals have 10-MeV electron
linacs that strike a metal foil to produce ray photons to irradiate tumors.

Colliding Beams
High-energy physics experiments were once done by aiming a beam of particles
from an accelerator at a stationary target. But to obtain the maximum possible
collision energy from a given accelerator, two beams of particles are now acceler-
ated to
