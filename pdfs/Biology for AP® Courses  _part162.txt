 another spherical s orbital and three “dumbbell”
shaped p orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as shown in Figure 2.8. After the 1s orbital is filled, the second
electron shell is filled, first filling its 2s orbital and then its three p orbitals. When filling the p orbitals, each takes a single
electron; once each p orbital has an electron, a second may be added. Lithium (Li) contains three electrons that occupy
the first and second shells. Two electrons fill the 1s orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital. Its electron
configuration is 1s22s1. Neon (Ne), on the other hand, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1s orbital
and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2s and three p orbitals); thus, it is an inert gas and energetically stable as
a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms. Larger elements have additional orbitals, making
up the third electron shell. While the concepts of electron shells and orbit
