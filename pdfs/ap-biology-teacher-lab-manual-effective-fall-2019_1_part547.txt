•  Some bacteria are naturally resistant to antibiotics, but others are not. How could you 
use two LB/agar plates, some E. coli, and some ampicillin (an antibiotic) to determine 
how E. coli cells are affected by ampicillin? 
•  What would you expect your experimental results to indicate about the effect of 
ampicillin on the E. coli cells? Do you think that exposure to ampicillin will cause the 
E. coli cells to evolve resistance to ampicillin? Why or why not? 
•  How will you be able to tell if host E. coli cells have been genetically transformed? 
(Hint: You will need some information from your teacher about the plasmid you will 
be using.) 
■ Procedure 
Your teacher will provide you with a plasmid containing one or more genes. The plasmid 
likely will contain the gene for resistance to ampicillin (pAMP), an antibiotic that is 
lethal to many bacteria, including E. coli cells. This tra
