As energy moves between trophic levels, energy is lost. This energy is either lost as heat or it is consumed by the
necessary metabolic processes that the organisms in that trophic level use. Because less energy is available as you
move up trophic levels, higher trophic levels necessarily will have smaller population sizes, as shown in Figure 22.3.

One polar bear might eat 50 seals in one year. Each seal needs to consume about 15 times its body weight in fish
in one year. As you move down the trophic levels in a food chain, the amount of biomass at the lower trophic levels
necessarily increases, with the producers possessing the greatest biomass.
If the population size of the producers decreased, there may not be sufficient food or energy for the remaining
trophic levels, and the food web may collapse. This is called bottom-up regulation of ecosystems. Photosynthetic
phytoplankton are the bottom trophic level of many marine ecosystems. Zooplankton feed on t
