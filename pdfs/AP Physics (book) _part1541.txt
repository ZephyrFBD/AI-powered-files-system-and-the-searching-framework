ough a substance is proportional to the difference in
temperature between its ends. The rate of heat flow also depends on the size and
shape of the object. To investigate this quantitatively, let us consider the heat flow
through a uniform cylinder, as illustrated in Fig. 14–6. It is found experimentally
that the heat flow Q over a time interval is given by the relation
(14;5)
where A is the cross-sectional area of the object,
is the distance between the two
ends, which are at temperatures 
and 
and k is a proportionality constant
called the thermal conductivity which is characteristic of the material. From
Eq. 14–5, we see that the rate of heat flow (units of 
) is directly proportional
to the cross-sectional area and to the temperature gradient† AT
