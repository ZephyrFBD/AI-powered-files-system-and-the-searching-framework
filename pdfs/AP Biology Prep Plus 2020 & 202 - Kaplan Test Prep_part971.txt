hen the adaptive immune system is activated later, lymphocytes produce antibodies
to target the antigen specifically.
The innate immune system does not provide long-lasting immunity,
however. If after days, the innate immune system is unable to fight off the
invasion, it will activate the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune
response is carried out by white blood cells called lymphocytes. B
lymphocytes and T cells are natural killer cells, which attack any foreign
object that enters the body. B lymphocytes produce antibodies that
specifically target the antigens and prevent them from sticking to the host
cell or releasing chemicals that can damage the host cell. The information
about the invading organisms is passed on to T cells, which activate
macrophages to digest pieces of the antigen. The entire immune response
causes clotting at the site of the laceration, as white blood cells and
lymphocytes die and blood coagulates on the surface of the skin,
preventing organisms from fu
