14.4 | DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How is DNA replicated in prokaryotes, and what are the roles of the leading and lagging strands and Okazaki
fragments in the process?
•
What is the role of DNA polymerase and other enzymes and proteins in supporting replication?

As was stated previously, DNA replication is more complex than simply unzipping the double helix and making new
complementary strands. Replication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence of nucleotides on the chromosome called the
origin of replication—the point at which the DNA opens up or unzips. The enzyme helicase opens up the DNA at the point
where hydrogen bonds connect the strands, resulting in the formation of a Y-shaped replication fork. Single-strand binding
proteins keep the fork open. The enzyme primase synthesizes RNA primers to initiate DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase,
which can add nucleotides only in th
