 5.93 The heat of combustion of fructose, C6H12O6, is 
-2812 kJ>mol. If a fresh golden delicious apple weighing 
4.23 oz (120 g) contains 16.0 g of fructose, what caloric con-
tent does the fructose contribute to the apple?
 5.94 The heat of combustion of ethanol, C2H5OH1l2, is 
-1367 kJ>mol. A batch of Sauvignon Blanc wine contains 
10.6% ethanol by mass. Assuming the density of the wine to 
be 1.0 g>mL, what is the caloric content due to the alcohol 
(ethanol) in a 6-oz glass of wine (177 mL)?
 5.95 The standard enthalpies of formation of gaseous pro-
pyne 1C3H42, propylene 1C3H62, and propane 1C3H82 are 
+185.4, +20.4, and -103.8 kJ>mol, respectively. (a) Calculate 
the heat evolved per mole on combustion of each substance to 
yield CO21g2 and H2O1g2. (b) Calculate the heat evolved on 
combustion of 1 kg of each substance. (c) Which is the most 
efficient fuel in terms of heat evolved per unit mass?
 5.96 It is interesting to compare the “fuel value” of a
