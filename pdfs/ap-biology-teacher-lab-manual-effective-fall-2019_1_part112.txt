■ Why Model? 
The following are five pragmatic uses for models in biology4: 
1. Simple models help biologists explore complex systems. 
2. Models can be used to explore various possibilities. 
3. Models can lead to the development of conceptual frameworks. 
4. Models can make accurate predictions. 
5. Models can generate explanations. 
But why engage students in modeling? The University of Wisconsin’s Project MUSE: 
Modeling for Understanding in Science Education proposes that students work at the 
following four levels of problem solving: 
1. Model-Less Problem Solving 
2. Model-Using Problem Solving 
3. Model-Revising Problem Solving 
4. Model-Building Problem Solving 
The MUSE taxonomy helps us recognize that as students learn to build models, they also 
develop an enhanced ability to solve problems at an expert level, rather than at a novice 
level. Students who use models develop a much better sense of epistemology (how do 
we know that we know), and
