In this chapter, we take a panoramic view of the descriptive chemistry of 
the nonmetallic elements, starting with hydrogen and progressing group 
by group across the periodic table. We will consider how the elements 
occur in nature, how they are isolated from their sources, and how they 
are used. We will emphasize hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon 
because these four nonmetals form many commercially important com-
pounds and account for 99% of the atoms required by living cells.
As you study this descriptive chemistry, it is important to look for 
trends rather than trying to memorize all the facts presented. The peri-
odic table is your most valuable tool in this task.

Everything we see in the chapter-
opening photo is composed of nonmetals. The 
water, of course, is H2O, and the sand is mostly 
SiO2. Although we cannot see it, the air contains
