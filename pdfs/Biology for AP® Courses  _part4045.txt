ing, called a cloaca, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. Coupling between birds usually involves
positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm. Mammals have separate openings for the systems
in the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring. The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large
numbers of offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus.
Sperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery
environment for external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into
the female’s vagina in mammals.
Think About It
The measure of an individual’s reproductive success is based on its ability to produce offspring. What adaptations
would a male have to have to be reproductively successful if his species utilizes external fertilization? Internal
