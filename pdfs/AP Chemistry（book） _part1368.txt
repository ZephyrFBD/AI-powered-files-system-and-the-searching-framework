We begin our discussion of molecular shapes with molecules (and ions) that, like 
CCl4, have a single central atom bonded to two or more atoms of the same type. Such 
molecules have the general formula ABn in which the central atom A is bonded to n B 
atoms. Both CO2 and H2O are AB2 molecules, for example, whereas SO3 and NH3 are AB3 
molecules, and so on.
The number of shapes possible for ABn molecules depends on the value of n. Those 
commonly found for AB2 and AB3 molecules are shown in Figure 9.2. An AB2 molecule 
must be either linear 1bond angle = 180°2 or bent 1bond angle ≠180°2. For AB3 mole-
cules, the two most common shapes place the B atoms at the corners of an equilateral 
triangle. If the A atom lies in the same plane as t
