protein
then activates adenylyl cyclase in the membrane to produce cAMP (the
second messenger). This begins a kinase cascade that does two things.
First, it activates glycogen phosphorylase to convert glycogen into

glucose. Second, it inhibits the conversion of glucose into glycogen. The
cascade amplifies the original signal. For every molecule of epinephrine
bound to a receptor on the cell surface, 20 molecules of cAMP are
produced, and 10,000 molecules of glucose are released by the liver. The
scientist who received the Nobel Prize in 1971 for discovering the role of
cAMP in this pathway is Earl Sutherland.
BPA AND YOU
Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial compound used in the manufacturing
of plastics, such as plastic food containers. The danger of this compound is
that it mimics the feminizing hormone estrogen and can set up an estrogen
signal transduction pathway even though no estrogen is present. So a
person exposed to BPA ex
