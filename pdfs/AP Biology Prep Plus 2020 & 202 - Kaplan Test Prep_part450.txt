The second generation oﬀspring would be expected to
consist of 10 red apple trees. The calculated chi-square value
based on the data is less than 3.84, so the diﬀerence is not
statistically significant.
(A)
The second generation oﬀspring would be expected to
consist of 10 yellow apple trees. The calculated chi-square
value based on the data is less than 3.84, so the diﬀerence is
not statistically significant.
(B)
The second generation oﬀspring would be expected to
consist of 5 red apple trees and 5 yellow apple trees. The
calculated chi-square value based on this data is less than
3.84, so the diﬀerence is not statistically significant.
(C)
The second generation oﬀspring would be expected to
consist of 5 red apple trees and 5 yellow apple trees. The
calculated chi-square value based on this data is greater than
