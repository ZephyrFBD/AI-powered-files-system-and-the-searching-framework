of 20. Even after taking into account the disease, famine, natural disasters,
and emigration that will occur, the population in 20 years will be

the United States with a stable population, zero population growth, where
the number of people in each age group is about the same and the birth
rates and the death rates are about equal.

begins, the life span during which the organisms are capable of

number of offspring the organism is capable of reproducing. Regar
