85. A wheel of mass M has radius R. It is standing vertically on
the floor, and we want to exert a horizontal force F at its axle
so that it will climb a step against which it rests (Fig. 8–60).
The step has height h, where
What minimum force F
is needed?
h 6 R.
v = 3.0 ms
86. If the coefficient of static friction between a car’s tires and
the pavement is 0.65, calculate the minimum torque that
must be applied to the 66-cm-diameter tire of a 1080-kg
automobile in order to “lay rubber” (make the wheels spin,
slipping as the car accelerates). Assume each wheel supports
an equal share of the weight.
87. A 4.00-kg mass and a 3.00-kg mass are attached to opposite
ends of a very light 42.0-cm-long horizontal rod (Fig. 8–61).
The system is rotating at angular speed  
about a vertical axle at the center of the rod. Determine
(a) the kinetic energy KE of the system, and (b) the net
force on each mass.
v = 5.60 rads
