rior National Forest grizzled skipper is able to survive in the
Boundary Waters long enough to mate, so there is no reason to believe the
oﬀspring would not be capable of surviving these same conditions. Lastly,
if the Boundary Waters grizzled skipper were able to successfully
reproduce with the Superior National Forest population, the introduction
of this new population would increase genetic variation and decrease the
frequency of rare harmful mutations—eliminating (C).

Nitrogen-fixing bacteria helps move nitrogen through the nitrogen cycle
turning ammonia into nitrites and then to nitrates. The passage states
haygrazer under 18 inches has high nitrate levels, and nitrates are
produced from nitrogen-fixing bacteria. If haygrazer has high levels of
nitrogen-fixing bacteria that would create high levels of nitrates, thus (A) is
a true statement and can be eliminated. The passage states that same
amount of Sun, water, and fertilizer will produce over 100 times more dry
weight of ha
