The figure shows a plot of the fraction, as a percentage, of
families of marine organisms, living at a particular point in
time that became extinct (vanished from the fossil record)
in the next geological moment. These mass extinctions
mark the ends of geologic periods. For example, the
Triassic period ended around 213 million years ago (Mya).
A. The fact that evolution is an ongoing process is
illustrated by these data. Whether the process displays a
pattern involving regular intervals is a question that has
been raised. Of those who believe periodicity is present, a
period of 26 million years is favored. A wave with this
periodicity is drawn on the figure. Evaluate the evidence
provided in terms of agreement and disagreement
