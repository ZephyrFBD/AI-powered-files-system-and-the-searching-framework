sumed by HA to produce A-; in this case 3HA4 decreases and 3A-4 
increases. (See Equation 17.6.) These two situations are summarized in Figure 17.2.
To calculate how the pH of the buffer responds to the addition of a strong acid or a 
strong base, we follow the strategy outlined in Figure 17.3:
1. Consider the acid–base neutralization reaction and determine its effect on [HA] and 
3A-4. This step is a limiting reactant stoichiometry calculation. 
 (Sections 3.6 and 3.7)
2. Use the calculated values of 3HA4 and 3A-4 along with Ka to calculate 3H+4. This 
step is an equilibrium calculation and is most easily done using the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation (if the concentrations of the weak acid–base pair are very 
large compared to Ka for the acid).
