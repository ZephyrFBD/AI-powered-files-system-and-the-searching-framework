ctric power plant can produce electricity at a fixed
power P, but the plant operator is free to choose the volt-
age V at which it is produced. This electricity is carried as an
electric current I through a transmission line (resistance R)
from the plant to the user, where it provides the user 
with electric power 
(a) Show that the reduction in
power
due to transmission losses is given by
(b) In order to reduce power losses during
transmission, should the operator choose V to be as large
or as small as possible?
76. A 2800-W oven is connected to a 240-V source. (a) What is
the resistance of the oven? (b) How long will it take to
bring 120 mL of 15°C water to 100°C assuming 65%
efficiency? (c) How much will this cost at 
77. A proposed electric vehicle makes use of storage batteries
as its source of energy. It is powered by 24 batteries, each
12 V,
Assume that the car is driven on level roads at
an average speed of 
and the average friction force
is 440 N. Assume 100% efficiency and ne
