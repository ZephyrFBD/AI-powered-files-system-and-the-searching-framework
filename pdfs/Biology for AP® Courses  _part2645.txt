Many swamp plants have adaptations that enable them to thrive in wet areas, where their roots grow
submerged underwater. In these aquatic areas, the soil is unstable and little oxygen is available to reach
the roots. Trees such as mangroves (Rhizophora sp.) growing in coastal waters produce aboveground
roots that help support the tree (Figure 23.30). Some species of mangroves, as well as cypress trees,
have pneumatophores: upward-growing roots containing pores and pockets of tissue specialized for gas
exchange. Wild rice is an aquatic plant with large air spaces in the root cortex. The air-filled tissue—called
aerenchyma—provides a path for oxygen to diffuse down to the root tips, which are embedded in oxygen-
poor bottom sediments.
