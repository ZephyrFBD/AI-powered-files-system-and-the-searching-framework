 consisting of three
consecutive nucleotides that specify one amino acid or the release of the newly formed polypeptide chain; for example, the
mRNA codon CAU specifies the amino acid histidine. The code is degenerate; that is, some amino acids are specified by
more than one codon, like synonyms you study in your English class (different word, same meaning). For example, CCU,
CCC, CCA, and CCG are all codons for proline. It is important to remember the same genetic code is universal to almost
all organisms on Earth. Small variations in codon assignment exist in mitochondria and some microorganisms.
Deviations from the simple scheme of the central dogma are discovered as researchers explore gene expression with new
technology. For example the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus which stores its genetic information in
single stranded RNA molecules. Upon infection of a host cell, RNA is used as a template by the virally encoded enzyme,
reverse transcriptase, to synthesize D
