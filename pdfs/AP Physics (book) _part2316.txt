a of the loop increases by

By Faraday’s law there is an induced
emf 
whose magnitude is given by
(21;3)
The induced current is clockwise (to counter the increasing flux).
Equation 21–3 is valid as long as B,
and are mutually perpendicular. (If they
are not, we use only the components of each that are mutually perpendicular.)An emf
induced on a conductor moving in a magnetic field is sometimes called motional emf.
We can also obtain Eq. 21–3 without using Faraday’s law. We saw in Chapter 20
that a charged particle moving with speed 
perpendicular to a magnetic field B
experiences a force 
(Eq. 20–4). When the rod of Fig. 21–11a moves to
the right with speed 
the electrons in the rod also move with this speed. Therefore,
since 
each electron feels a force 
which acts up the page as the red
arrow in Fig.21–11b shows. If the rod is not in contact with the 
conductor,
electrons would collect at the upper end of the rod, leaving the lower end positive
