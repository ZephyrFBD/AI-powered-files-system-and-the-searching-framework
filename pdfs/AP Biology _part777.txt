 of the cells is so regular that it is possible to label a
specific blastomere (individual cells of a blastocyst) and identify the
tissue that results as embryonic development proceeds. Labeling these
cells produces a fate map.
Gastrulation is a process that involves rearrangement of the blastula or
blastocyst and begins with the formation of the blastopore, an opening
into the blastula. In some animals, the blastopore becomes the mouth; in
other animals (deuterostomes), the blastopore becomes the anus. Some of
the cells on the surface of the embryo migrate into the blastopore to form a
new cavity called the archenteron or primitive gut. As a result of this cell
movement, gastrulation forms a three-layered embryo called a gastrula.
These three differentiated layers, called embryonic germ layers, are the
ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. They will develop into all the parts
of the adult animal.
The ectoderm will become the skin and the nervous system.
The endoderm will form the viscera
