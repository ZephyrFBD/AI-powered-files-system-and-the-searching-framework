which reflects the relative ease with which 
its outer s electron can be removed. As a result, the alkali metals are all very reactive, 
readily losing one electron to form ions carrying a 1+ charge. 
 (Section 2.7)
The alkali metals exist in nature only as compounds. Sodium and potassium are 
relatively abundant in Earth’s crust, in seawater, and in biological systems, always as 
the cations of ionic compounds. All alkali metals combine directly with most non-
metals. For example, they react with hydrogen to form hydrides and with sulfur to 
form sulfides:
 
2 M1s2 + H21g2 ¡ 2 MH1s2 
[7.16]
 
2 M1s2 + S1s2 ¡ M2S1s2 
[7.17]
where M represents any alkali metal. In hydrides of the alkali metals (LiH, NaH, and 
so forth), hydrogen is present as H-, the hydride ion. A hydrogen atom that has 
gained an electron, this ion is distinct from the hydrogen ion, H+, formed when a 
hydrogen atom loses its electron.
The alkali metals react vigorously with water, producing hydrogen gas and a
