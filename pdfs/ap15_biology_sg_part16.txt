The figure below shows the results of a study of the snake population, both before and after the 
introduction of the outside males. In the study, the numbers of captured snakes is an indication of the 
overall population size. 
 
(a) Describe ONE characteristic of the original population that may have led to the population's 
decline in size between 1989 and 1993. 
Description (1 point) 
• 
Lacked genetic diversity/variation 
• 
Was an aged/post-reproductive population/not enough young snakes 
• 
Had unfavorable sex ratio/too few males 
• 
Possessed a harmful mutation/disease  
 
(b) Propose ONE reason that the introduction of the outside males rescued the snake population 
from decline. 
Proposal (1 point) 
• 
Increased genetic diversity in the population 
• 
Increased reproductive success 
• 
Established beneficial sex ratio/sufficient proportion of males for reproduction 
• 
Introduced resistance to disease that was affecting the original population 
 
(c) Describe how the data su
