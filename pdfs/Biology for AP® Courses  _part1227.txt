s, the arrangement of
the tetrads is different. The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There
are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n, where
n is the number of chromosomes per set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (223)
possible genetically-distinct gametes. This number does not include the variability that was previously created in the sister
chromatids by crossover. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis
will have the same genetic composition (Figure 11.4).
To summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I, the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events
that occur between each homologous pair during prophase I. In addition, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase
plate produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that
