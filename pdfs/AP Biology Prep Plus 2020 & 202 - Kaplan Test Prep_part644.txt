ys express the trait in question, since men have only one X
chromosome.

Pedigrees are family trees that enable us to study the
inheritance of a particular trait across many related
generations. They can also help us determine the type of
transmission through generations: autosomal
recessive/dominant, X-linked recessive/dominant, and so on.

1. In order to develop better melons, researchers want to use a
mutagen, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), to induce mutations in a
melon crop. The numbers and rates of mutations caused by EMS
are shown in Table 1 and the rates of diﬀerent mutation types are
shown in Table 2.
