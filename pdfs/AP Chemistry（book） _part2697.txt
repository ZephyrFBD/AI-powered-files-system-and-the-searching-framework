e acid–base pair 
will determine the pH of the buffer. The equilibrium relationship 
between NH4
+ and NH3 is given by the base-dissociation reaction 
for NH3:
NH31aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH4
+1aq2 + OH-1aq2
Kb =
3NH4
+43OH-4
3NH34
 = 1.8 * 10-5
The key to this exercise is to use this Kb expression to calculate 3NH4
+4.

Therefore, we have:
Comment In Sample Exercise 17.3, the calculated pH is the same 
whether we solve exactly using the quadratic equation or make the 
simplifying assumption that the equilibrium concentrations of acid 
and base are equal to their initial concentrations. The simplifying 
assumption works because the concentrations of the acid–base con-
jugate pair are both a thousand times larger than Ka. In this Sample 
Exercise, the acid–base conjugate pair concentrations are only 10–100 
as large as Ka. Therefore, we cannot assume that x is small compared to 
the initial concentrations (that is, that the initial concentrations are
