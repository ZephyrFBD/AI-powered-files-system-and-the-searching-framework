 Which of the following hypotheses would best explain
these observations?
The sequences of the two mRNA molecules have diﬀerent
mutations.
(A)
The proteins are encoded by the sense and antisense strands
of DNA.
(B)
Alternative splicing takes place in diﬀerent tissues.
(C)
The proteins undergo extensive post-translational
modifications.
(D)
5. A part of an mRNA molecule with the following sequence is being
read by a ribosome:
5′-UCG-GCA-CAU-UUA-UAU-GUU-3′
Using the codon table above, determine the amino acid sequence
encoded.
CODON TABLE
ser-ala-his-leu-tyr-val
(A)
ser-ala-gln-leu-(stop signal)
(B)
ser-arg-val-asn-ile-gln
(C)
leu-tyr-ile-tyr-thr-ala
(D)
6. Cellular proliferation in cancer can be regulated by signaling
receptors belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family.
Binding of a ligand to RTKs triggers phosphorylation of tyrosine
residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein. One approach
to cancer treatment has been the use of small molecule inhibitors
that prevent
