2 + 6 HPO4
2 -1aq2 + 2 H2O1l2
The Ca2 +  and HPO4
2 -  ions diffuse out of the enamel and are washed 
away by saliva. The acids that attack the hydroxyapatite are formed 
by the action of bacteria on sugars and other carbohydrates present 
in the plaque adhering to the teeth.
Fluoride ion, which is added to municipal water systems and 
toothpastes, can react with hydroxyapatite to form ﬂuoroapatite, 
Ca101PO426F2. This mineral, in which F- has replaced OH-, is much 
more resistant to attack by acids because the ﬂuoride ion is a much 
weaker Brønsted–Lowry base than the hydroxide ion.
The usual concentration of F- in municipal water systems is 
1 mg>L 11 ppm2. The compound added may be NaF or Na2SiF6. The 
silicon-ﬂuorine anion reacts with water to release ﬂuoride ions:

About 80% of all toothpastes now sold in the United States 
contain ﬂuoride compounds, usually at the level of 0.1% ﬂuoride by 
mass. The most common compounds in t
