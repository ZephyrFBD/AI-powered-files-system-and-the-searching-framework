gure 5. Leaf Disks 
Step 5 Draw the gases out of the spongy mesophyll tissue and infiltrate the leaves with the 
sodium bicarbonate solution by performing the following steps: 
a. Remove the piston or plunger from both syringes. Place the 10 leaf disks into each 
syringe barrel. 
b. Replace the plunger, but be careful not to crush the leaf disks. Push in the plunger 
until only a small volume of air and leaf disk remain in the barrel (less than 10%).
c. Pull a small volume (5 cc) of sodium bicarbonate plus soap solution from your 
prepared cup into one syringe and a small volume of water plus soap into the 
other syringe. Tap each syringe to suspend the leaf disks in the solution. Make 
sure that, with the plunger inverted, the disks are suspended in the solution. Make 
sure no air remains. Move the plunger to get rid of air from the plunger before 
you attempt Step d. 
d. You now want to create a vacuum in the plunger to draw the air out of the leaf 
tissue. This is the most difficult
