. Assume the same angle in each case.
RESPONSE Let us draw free-body diagrams for the sled–sister combination,
as shown in Figs. 4–31c and d. They show, for the two cases, the forces exerted
by you,
(an unknown), by the snow,
and 
and gravity 
(a) If you
push her, and 
there is a vertically downward component to your force.
Hence the normal force upward exerted by the ground (Fig. 4–31c) will be
larger than mg (where m is the mass of sister plus sled). (b) If you pull her, your
force has a vertically upward component, so the normal force 
will be less
than mg, Fig. 4–31d. Because the friction force is proportional to the normal
force,
will be less if you pull her. So you exert less force if you pull her.
Two boxes and a pulley. In Fig. 4–32a, two boxes are 
connected by a cord running over a pulley. The coefficient of kinetic friction
between box A and the table is 0.20. We ignore the mass of the cord and pulley
and any friction in the pulley, which means we can assume that a force app
