ed to the surroundings. 
Work is done as the gases expand against the surroundings, mov-
ing the solid materials and imparting kinetic energy to them. For 
example, a chunk of rock might be impelled upward. It has been 
given kinetic energy by transfer of energy from the hot, expand-
ing gases. As the rock rises, its kinetic energy is transformed into 
potential energy. Eventually, it again acquires kinetic energy as it 
falls to Earth. When it strikes Earth, its kinetic energy is converted 
largely to thermal energy, though some work may be done on the 
surroundings as well.
Chapter Summary and Key Terms
CHEMICAL ENERGY (INTRODUCTION AND SECTION 5.1) Ther-
modynamics is the study of energy and its transformations. In this 
chapter we have focused on thermochemistry, the transformations 
of energy—especially heat—during chemical reactions.
An object can possess energy in two forms: (1) kinetic energy, 
which is the energy due to the motion of the object, and (2) po-
tential energy, whi
