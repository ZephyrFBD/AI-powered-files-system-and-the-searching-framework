 chemistry is an im-
portant theme throughout all of chemistry that we begin to explore here.
When a solution of an acid and a solution of a base are mixed, a neutralization 
reaction occurs. The products of the reaction have none of the characteristic properties 
of either the acidic solution or the basic solution. For example, when hydrochloric acid is 
mixed with a solution of sodium hydroxide, the reaction is
 
HCl1aq2 + NaOH1aq2 ยก H2O1l2 + NaCl1aq2   
[4.11]
 
(acid)  
(base)  
(water)  
(salt)
Water and table salt, NaCl, are the products of the reaction. By analogy to this reaction, the 
term salt has come to mean any ionic compound whose cation comes from a base (for exam-
ple, Na+ from NaOH) and whose anion comes from an acid (for example, Cl- from HCl). In 
general, a neutralization reaction between an acid and a metal hydroxide produces water and a salt.
Because HCl, NaOH, and NaCl are all water-soluble strong electrolytes, the complete 
ionic equation associated with Equatio
