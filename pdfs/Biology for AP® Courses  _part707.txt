Explain why the lock-and-key model does not adequately represent the relationship between hexokinase and glucose.
a.
Hexokinase changes conformation in presence of glucose
b.
Hexokinase induces change in the glucose structure
c.
Hexokinase requires an effector molecule to bind at allosteric site
d.
Hexokinase binds glucose without any conformational change
Think About It
The hydrolysis of one ATP molecules releases 7.3 kcal/mol of energy (ΔG = –7.3 kcal/mol energy). If it takes 2.1 kcal/
mol of energy to move one Na+ across the membrane (ΔG = +2.1 kcal/mol of energy), how many sodium ions could
be moved by the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule?
Section Summary
ATP is the primary energy-supplying molecule for living cells. ATP is made up of a nucleotide, a five-carbon sugar, and
three phosphate groups. The bonds that connect the phosphates (phosphoanhydride bonds) have high-energy content. The
energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP + Pi is used to
