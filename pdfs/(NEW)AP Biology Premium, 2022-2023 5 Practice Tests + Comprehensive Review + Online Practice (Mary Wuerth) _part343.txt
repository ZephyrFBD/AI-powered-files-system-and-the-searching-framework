s with uracil (U). When adenine pairs with another base,
either thymine or uracil, it forms two hydrogen bonds. Guanine and cytosine pairs form three hydrogen bonds
between them.
The five-carbon sugar also differs slightly in DNA and RNA. DNA contains the five-carbon sugar deoxyribose,
while RNA has the five-carbon sugar ribose. An important difference between these sugars is at the 2′ carbon.
Deoxyribose has a hydrogen atom attached to the 2′ carbon, while ribose has a hydroxyl (–OH) group attached to the
2′ carbon, as shown in Figure 15.2.
TIP
An easy way to remember which nitrogenous bases are purines and which are pyrimidines are the mnemonic devices “PureAsGold” for Purines
are Adenine and Guanine, and “CUtThePy” for Cytosine, Uracil, and Thymine are Pyrimidines.

This small difference makes DNA much more stable than RNA. This increased stability of DNA may explain why it
is the carrier of genetic information between generations, while RNA usually
