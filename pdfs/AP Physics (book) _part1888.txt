each second, or 44.1 kHz,
like a CD. That is, a sample is taken every 
.
In 0.50 ms, as shown here, 22 samples (black dots) are taken. This is an
alternate way to represent sampling compared to Fig. 17-24, and shows that 
we cannot see any changes that might happen between the samplings (dots).

Figure 17–25 gives some details about a pure 2000-Hz sound sampled at 
44.1 kHz. Normal musical sounds are a complex summation of many such sine
waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. A simple summation was shown in
Fig. 12–14. Another example is shown in Fig. 17–26, where we can see that the
fine details may be missed by a digital conversion. Look at Fig. 17–25: if that were
20,000 Hz (highest frequency of human hearing), it would be sampled only about
two times per wavelength. Both those samples might be zero volts—obviously missing
the entire waveform. Over many wavelengths, it might eventually reproduce the
waveform s
