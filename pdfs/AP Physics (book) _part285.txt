The idea that projectile motion is parabolic was, in Galileo’s day, at the fore-
front of physics research. Today we discuss it in Chapter 3 of introductory physics!

We now consider how observations made in different frames of reference are
related to each other. For example, consider two trains approaching one another,
each with a speed of 
with respect to the Earth. Observers on the Earth
beside the train tracks will measure 
for the speed of each of the trains.
Observers on either one of the trains (a different frame of
