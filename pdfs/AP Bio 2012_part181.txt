ETS. Possible consequences 
that the student may cite include less ATP and NADPH 
produced because these energy-carriers are produced in the 
ETS, and decreased O2 production if photosynthesis grinds 
to a halt. Justifications are more limited.

(Part b) The student is able to identify, explain, or describe 
two to three consequences of viral infection on individual 
plants and justify the predictions. However, justifications 
are more limited. Predictions may include, but are not 
limited to, stunted growth due to lack of energy needed for 
building molecules; the inability to grow, repair tissues, and 
reproduce due to lack of usable free energy; and plant death 
if energy demands cannot be met. 
(Part c) The student is able to explain how a change in 
the plant population due to infection affects the prairie 
community as a whole with respect to energy flow/
dynamics. The student is able to predict two to three 
consequences of short-term change due to a viral infection
