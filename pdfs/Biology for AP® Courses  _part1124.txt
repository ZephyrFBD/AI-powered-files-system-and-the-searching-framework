interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the S phase, DNA
replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of DNA molecules—sister
chromatids—that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two
centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during
mitosis. At the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the
centrioles, which are at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the
centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.
G2 Phase (Second Gap)
In the G2 phase, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation.
Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to pr
