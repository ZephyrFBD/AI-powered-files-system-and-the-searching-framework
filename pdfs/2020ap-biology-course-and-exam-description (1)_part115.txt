lex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.F
Explain how changes to the 
structure of an enzyme may 
affect its function.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.F.1
Change to the molecular structure of a 
component in an enzymatic system may result 
in a change of the function or efficiency of 
the system— 
a. 
Denaturation of an enzyme occurs when the 
protein structure is disrupted, eliminating the 
ability to catalyze reactions.
b. 
Environmental temperatures and pH outside 
the optimal range for a given enzyme will 
cause changes to its structure, altering the 
efficiency with which it catalyzes reactions. 
ENE-1.F.2
In some cases, enzyme denaturation is 
reversible, allowing the enzyme to regain activity.
SUGGESTED SKILL
Argumentation
6.E.c
Predict the causes or effects 
of a change in, or disruption 
to, one or more components 
in a biological system based 
on data.
