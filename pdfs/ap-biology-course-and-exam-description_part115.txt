eed of movement of molecules in a 
solution, increasing the frequency of collisions 
between enzymes and substrates and 
therefore increasing the rate of reaction.
ENE-1G.4
Competitive inhibitor molecules can bind 
reversibly or irreversibly to the active site of 
the enzyme. Noncompetitive inhibitors can 
bind allosteric sites, changing the activity of 
the enzyme.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.G
Explain how the cellular 
environment affects 
enzyme activity.
