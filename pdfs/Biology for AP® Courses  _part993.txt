 above, identify the source of
electrons for the synthesis of NADPH.
B.
Calculate the number of electrons transferred in
this reaction.
C.
Using the free energies per electron displayed,
calculate the free energy change of the light-
dependent reactions.
D.
Given that the free energy change for the
hydrolysis of ATP is -31.5 kJ/mole and the free
energy change for the formation of NADPH
from NADP+ is 18 kJ/mole, calculate the total
production of free energy for the light reactions.
E.
Using this definition of energy efficiency,
calculate the efficiency of the light reaction of
photosynthesis: energy efficiency = free energy
produced/energy input.
49. Algae can be used for food and fuel. To maximize
profit from algae production under artificial light,
researchers proposed an experiment to determine the
dependence of the efficiency of the process used to grow
the algae on light intensity (“brightness”) that will be
purchased from the electric company.
The algae will be grown on a flat she
