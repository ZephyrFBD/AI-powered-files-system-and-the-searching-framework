3. Regeneration of RuBP: In order for the Calvin cycle to continue, the five-carbon RuBP must be regenerated.
For every five molecules of G3P (a three-carbon molecule), there are 15 carbon atoms present. Using ATP
from the light-dependent reactions, these five G3P molecules rearrange and form three molecules of RuBP (a
five-carbon molecule), which also contain 15 carbon atoms. This process requires energy, which comes from
the light-dependent reactions.
TIP
C4 and CAM photosynthesis occurs in plants in warmer climates, but that is beyond the scope of the AP Biology exam. Focus on the light-
dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle when preparing for test day.
