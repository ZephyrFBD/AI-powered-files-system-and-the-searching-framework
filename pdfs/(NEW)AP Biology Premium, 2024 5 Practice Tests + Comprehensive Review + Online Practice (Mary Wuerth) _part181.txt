intervals for the 1% and 3% enzyme concentrations do not overlap, so choice (A) is
incorrect. Similarly, choice (B) is incorrect because the 95% confidence intervals for the 1% and 6% enzyme
concentrations do not overlap. Choice (D) is incorrect because the 95% confidence intervals for the 1% and 3%
and the 1% and 6% enzyme concentrations do not overlap and likely have statistically significant differences
between them.
4. (C) Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of an enzyme. Therefore, adding a competitive inhibitor of
BCR-ABL would block ATP from binding to its active site. Choices (A) and (B) are both incorrect because
cofactors and coenzymes enhance enzyme function. Choice (D) is incorrect because a transcription factor would
not affect ATP’s ability to bind to the enzyme.
5. (B) The activation energy in the presence of an enzyme is the difference in free energy between the reactants
and the transition state in the presence of the enzyme. Choice (A) is incorrect because
