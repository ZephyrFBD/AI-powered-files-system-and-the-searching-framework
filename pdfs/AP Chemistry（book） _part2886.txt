CHAPTER 18 Chemistry of the Environment
One way to reduce the quantity of SO2 released into the environment is to remove sul-
fur from coal and oil before these fuels are burned. Although difficult and expensive, several 
methods have been developed. Powdered limestone 1CaCO32, for example, can be injected 
into the furnace of a power plant, where it decomposes into lime (CaO) and carbon dioxide:
 
CaCO31s2 ¡ CaO1s2 + CO21g2 
The CaO then reacts with SO2 to form calcium sulfite:
 
CaO1s2 + SO21g2 ¡ CaSO31s2
