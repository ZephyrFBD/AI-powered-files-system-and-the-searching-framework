healed. This pain is often accompanied by sterile
inflammation with components of the innate immune
system such as macrophages. Refine the model of
coordinated response identified in part B to describe how
chemical messengers associated with the immune response
can cause chronic pain.
Unlike local anesthetics general anesthetics block signal
transduction of the entire central nervous system and the
brain. However, while the patient is unconscious the
peripheral nervous system continues to support signaling
to other systems such as heart and lungs. An explanation
might be that the signal in the central and peripheral
nervous systems are segregated and that the latter
functions without cognitive integration (thought) as the
name “autonomic” implies. The respiratory center that
provides autonomic co
