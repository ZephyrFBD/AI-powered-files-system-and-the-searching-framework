moter on the DNA. This
activates the production of an mRNA that, when translated, produces a protein that stimulates differentiation of the
cell into a vulva cell, a cell involved in egg laying. Cells farther away from the anchor cell and receiving low
concentrations of the inducer become skin cells.
4. Apoptosis is programmed cell death. Not all cells that are produced
during development are destined to become a permanent member of the multicellular organism. Some cells only
have a temporary role during the assembly of the organism and, therefore, are deliberately destroyed. The process of
destruction begins with an external signal that initiates a signal transduction pathway that activates cell-death genes.
The genes code for enzymes that break down proteins (proteases). Cell fragmentation ensues. Chemicals released by
the dying cell generate another signal transduction pathway in neighboring cells that stimulates the phagocytosis of
cellular remains.
