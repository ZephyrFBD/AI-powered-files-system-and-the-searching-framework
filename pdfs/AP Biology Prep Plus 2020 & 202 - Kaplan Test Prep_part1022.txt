 bay. Based on an analysis of the data, identify the seasonal
trends of algal blooms, of dissolved nitrogen, and of dissolved
phosphorus.
(b)
Some algae blooms can produce toxic chemicals. Describe how toxins
may aﬀect fish-eating birds, and describe how algal blooms impact the
ecology of two of the listed organisms aﬀected by algal blooms.
(c)
Propose one treatment method and justify how it would reduce algal
blooms.
(d)
3. The location of amino acids in a protein molecule is determined by
calculating the extent by which an amino acid is buried in the protein
structure when exposed to a solvent. The figure below shows the
distribution of the 20 amino acids within protein molecules exposed to the
same solvent.
Describe how a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein may lead
to changes in the protein structure or function.
(a)
Based on the figure, identify the polarity of the solvent that the protein
molecules were exposed to.
(b)
A transmembrane protein spans the entire width of
