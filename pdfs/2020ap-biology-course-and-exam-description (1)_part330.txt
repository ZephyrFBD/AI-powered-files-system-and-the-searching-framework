Scientists exposed the collected mosquitoes to filter papers soaked in two different pyrethroid insecticides, deltamethrin 
and permethrin, and the percent mortality of the mosquitoes was determined after 24 hours (Figure 2). The scientists 
simultaneously determined whether leucine or phenylalanine was encoded at position 1014 by each of the two copies of the 
sodium channel gene (Table 1).
