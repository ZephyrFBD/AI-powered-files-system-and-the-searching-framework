Day 2
When developing their own investigations, students should choose substances to test 
that are interesting to them. They may have experiences with fruit flies in their home and 
can think about what attracts flies. They also may want to find a substance that would 
repel a fly. They can bring substances from home to test, but make sure they obtain your

should share and graphically illustrate their results.
