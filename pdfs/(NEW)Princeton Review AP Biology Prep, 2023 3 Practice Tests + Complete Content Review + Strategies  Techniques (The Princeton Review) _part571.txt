1. The human retina has two types of photoreceptors—rods and cones—which respond to light stimuli.
Stimulation of photoreceptors is essential for the organisms to respond to visual stimuli. When the rods and
cones absorb a photon, a molecule called retinal alters their conformation and allows a sodium channel to
close.
The response of rods—that is, the voltage—can be measured with a microelectrode. When a rod cell is bathed
in vitreous humor, the fluid found inside the eyeball, it has a resting membrane potential of –40mV. As the rod
is exposed to light, the membrane potential becomes more negative, or hyperpolarized.

In Experiment 1, a rod was stimulated and its responses measured.
