lifetimes. Glacier National
Park in Montana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers, a phenomenon known as glacier recession. In 1850, the
area contained approximately 150 glaciers. By 2010, however, the park contained only about 24 glaciers greater than 25
acres in size. One of these glaciers is the Grinnell Glacier (Figure 35.30) at Mount Gould. Between 1966 and 2005, the size
of Grinnell Glacier shrank by 40 percent. Similarly, the mass of the ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic is decreasing:
Greenland lost 150–250 km3 of ice per year between 2002 and 2006. In addition, the size and thickness of the Arctic sea ice
is decreasing.
Figure 35.30 The effect of global warming can be seen in the continuing retreat of Grinnel Glacier. The mean annual
temperature in the park has increased 1.33 °C since 1900. The loss of a glacier results in the loss of summer
meltwaters, sharply reducing seasonal water supplies and severely affecting local ecosystems. (credit: modification o
