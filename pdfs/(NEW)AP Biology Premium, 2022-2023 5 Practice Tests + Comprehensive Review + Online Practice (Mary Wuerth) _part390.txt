e interactions between regulatory sequences and regulatory proteins to turn genes on or
off and to regulate the levels of gene expression.
The following are some examples of regulatory sequences used in eukaryotes:
■Promoters—sequences that serve as binding sites for RNA polymerase.
■Regulatory switches—sequences to which activator proteins or repressor proteins may bind. Enhancers are
regulatory switches to which activator proteins or transcription factors bind. Silencers are regulatory switches
to which repressor proteins bind.
Some examples of regulatory proteins include:
■Repressors—These bind to regulatory switches and turn off or suppress gene expression.
■Activators—These bind to regulatory switches and upregulate gene expression.
■Transcription factors—These help RNA polymerase bind to the promoter and start transcription.
■Mediators—These serve as “connectors” between other regulatory proteins and allow regulatory proteins to
communicate.
