l respiration will speed up. When muscle cells have
exhausted their stores of oxygen, then the electron transport chain will cease and fermentation will take over.
b. Construct a graph of the data indicating citric acid cycle activity. Be sure to use error bars. (4 points)
1 point—proper axes
1 point—proper labels/data organization
1 point—proper size of bars
1 point—graphing error bars
c. Identify which group did not show an increase in cardiolipin after exercise was done. Justify your choice with
data. (2 points)
The obese group did not show an increase after exercise. Although the numbers 72 and 83 seem different, when
the std error is considered, the values overlap: 72 + 7.9 = 79.9 and 83 – 4.8 = 78.2. The lean and T2DM participants
each saw an increase in cardiolipin with exercise.
d. If another measure of the citric acid cycle were added in a future experiment, explain what results you would
expect. (2 points)
If another measure were included, I would expect an increase for all g
