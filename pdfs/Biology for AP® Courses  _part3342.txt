levels, eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect, by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal
muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis. Glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and
released into circulation by the liver cells. Glucagon also stimulates absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver,
which then converts them to glucose. This process of glucose synthesis is called gluconeogenesis. Glucagon also stimulates
adipose cells to release fatty acids into the blood. These actions mediated by glucagon result in an increase in blood glucose
levels to normal homeostatic levels. Rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon release by the pancreas via a
negative feedback mechanism. In this way, insulin and glucagon work together to maintain homeostatic glucose levels, as
shown in Figure 28.11.
