4. A farmer growing grape vines is testing out two subspecies of
grapes in his vineyard. Some regions of the vineyard have
unfertilized soils while other regions of the vineyard are artificially
fertilized. In addition, he artificially induces some plants to flower
while allowing others to flower naturally. Which of the following
observations would be the most likely outcome of this
experiment?
Fruit weight is lower for both subspecies when unfertilized
because the plants have less energy to invest in fruit
production.
(A)
Fruit weight is higher for both subspecies when unfertilized
becauseÂ the plants invest more energy in reproduction as
they reduce expenditure on their own growth.
(B)
The naturally flowering plants in both subspecies have larger
fruit because the artificially flowering plants would
experience too much stress.
(C)
The artificially flowering plants in both s
