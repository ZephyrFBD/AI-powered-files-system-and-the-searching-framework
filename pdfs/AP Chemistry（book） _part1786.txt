 is also an important factor. Dipole–dipole forces increase in 
strength as the polarity of the molecule increases. Hydrogen bonding 
occurs in compounds containing O¬H, N ¬ H, and F¬ H bonds. 
Hydrogen bonds are generally stronger than dipole–dipole or disper-
sion forces. Ion–dipole forces are important in solutions in which ionic 
compounds are dissolved in polar solvents.
SELECT PROPERTIES OF LIQUIDS (SECTION 11.3) The stronger 
the intermolecular forces, the greater is the viscosity, or resistance to 
flow, of a liquid. Surface tension is a measure of the tendency of a liq-
uid to maintain a minimum surface area. The surface tension of a liq-
uid also increases as intermolecular forces increase in strength. The 
adhesion of a liquid to the walls of a narrow tube and the cohesion of 
the liquid account for capillary action.
PHASE CHANGES (SECTION 11.4) A substance may exist in more 
than one state of matter, or phase. Phase changes are transformations 
from one phase to another. Ch
