30. A student measures the osmolality of two aqueous
solutions, A and B. The student finds that the osmolality of
solution B is much higher than solution A. Based on this
result, how do solutions A and B likely differ in the
concentration of solutes in their solution, and why?
a.
Solution A likely is the more concentrated
solution because osmolality measures the moles
of solute per kilogram of solute.
b.
Solution B likely is the more concentrated
solution because osmolality measures the moles
of solute per kilogram of solvent.
c.
Solution A likely is the more concentrated
solution because osmolality measures the moles
of solute per kilogram of solvent.
d.
Solution B likely is the more concentrated
solution because osmolality measures the moles
of solute per kilogram of solute.
31. Would an organism that is constantly in a hypertonic
environment likely be an osmoregulator or an
osmoconformer? Why?
a.
osmoconformer, because it would need to
prevent water from leaving its body to r
