Genes are segments of DNA that code for a specific protein. An organismâ€™s traits are determined by the genes inherited
from each parent. Duplicated chromosomes are composed of two sister chromatids. Chromosomes are compacted using a

variety of mechanisms during certain stages of the cell cycle. Several classes of protein are involved in the organization
and packing of the chromosomal DNA into a highly condensed structure. The condensing complex compacts
chromosomes, and the resulting condensed structure is necessary for chromosomal segregation during mitosis.
10.2 The Cell Cycle
The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely
timed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period, called
