as a control. 
(b) A student incorrectly plotted one value from the table on a graph (Figure 1). Identify the error in the 
student-constructed graph. Provide reasoning to support the studentâ€™s choice of a logarithmic scale on the 
Y axis.  
(c) Using the template provided, calculate the percent of plants or plant parts remaining from one life stage to 
the next life stage. Round your answer to one decimal place. Based on your calculations, identify the plant 
life stage at which the insects have the greatest impact on the life cycle of the plant. Justify your answer. 
Describe the most likely interaction between the insects and the plants.  
(d) In a second experiment, researchers used a different insecticide that affects a different group of insects. In 
this treatment, the number of seeds formed was greatly reduced compared to the control. Based on this 
observation, describe the most likely interaction between the affected insects and the plants in this 
experiment. Justify your re
