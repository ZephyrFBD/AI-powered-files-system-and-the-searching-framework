 water to a high reservoir
when demand is low and then releasing it to drive turbines
during peak demand. Suppose water is pumped to a lake
115 m above the turbines at a rate of 
for
10.0 h at night. (a) How much energy (kWh) is needed to do
this each night? (b) If all this energy is released during a 14-h
day, at 75% efficiency, what is the average power output?
*55. (II) Water is stored in an artificial lake created by a dam
(Fig. 15–27). The water depth is 48 m at the dam, and a
steady flow rate of 
is maintained through hydro-
electric turbines installed near the base of the dam. How
much electrical
power can be
produced?
