get based on a 
careful accounting of money coming in and money going out. Likewise, the energy 
dynamics of a biological community can be modeled by accounting for the energy 
coming in and the energy going out through different members of the community. 
Keeping track of money is relatively straightforward — you count it. You count how 
much money is coming in and how much is going to various expenses and savings.  
How do you keep track of energy in living organisms? It is a challenge. Producers 
capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy stored in energy-rich 
molecules. These molecules have mass, so the energy in biological systems can be 
indirectly measured by mass — biomass. With your lab team, take a moment to 
brainstorm how you can account for energy use and transfer in a biological system 
in a manner similar to the way in which people account for money.
