ow you would prepare each of the following 
aqueous solutions, starting with solid KBr: (a) 0.75 L of 
1.5 * 10-2 M KBr, (b) 125 g of 0.180 m KBr, (c) 1.85 L of a 
solution that is 12.0% KBr by mass (the density of the solu-
tion is 1.10 g>mL), (d) a 0.150 M solution of KBr that con-
tains just enough KBr to precipitate 16.0 g of AgBr from a 
solution containing 0.480 mol of AgNO3.
 13.54  Describe how you would prepare each of the following 
aqueous solutions: (a) 1.50 L of 0.110 M 1NH422SO4 solution, 
starting with solid 1NH422SO4; (b) 225 g of a solution that 
is 0.65 m in Na2CO3, starting with the solid solute; (c) 1.20 
L of a solution that is 15.0% Pb1NO322 by mass (the den-
sity of the solution is 1.16 g>mL), starting with solid solute; 
 
(d) a 0.50 M solution of HCl that would just neutralize 5.5 g 
of Ba1OH22 starting with 6.0 M HCl.
 13.55  Commercial aqueous nitric acid has a density of 1.42 g>mL 
and is 16 M. Calculate the percent HNO3 by mass in the 
solution.
