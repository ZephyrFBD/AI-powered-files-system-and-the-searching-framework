 in the same direction (since
there are only two choices, spin up 
or spin down 
). This
would seem to violate the exclusion principle; but if quarks have that additional
quantum number color, which is different for each quark, it would serve to
distinguish them and allow the exclusion principle to hold. Although quark color,
