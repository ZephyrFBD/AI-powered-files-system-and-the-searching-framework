ata set is the median. If there are an even number of data
points in the set, calculate the mean of the two numbers in the middle of the data set to find the median. Hereâ€™s how
you would find the median for data set A and data set B:
Data Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Since the members of the data set are already arranged from lowest to highest, look for the middle value, which
in this case is 3.
Data Set B: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
Since the members of this data set are all the same, the median is 3.
Again, even though data sets A and B are very different, they have the same median.
Extremes in a data set do not affect the median, but they do affect the mean of the data set. For example, add the
numbers 0 and 100 to data set A and data set B to form new data sets C and D, respectively. This changes the means
greatly from the original calculations, but the medians do not change:
Data Set C: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100
Data Set D: 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 100
Using the mean and median alone are often not enough to accu
