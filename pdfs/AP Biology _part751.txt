CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter covered the human immune system. The most important
takeaways from this chapter include all of the examples of how cells
communicate with each other.
Innate (inborn) defense mechanisms are nonspecific. These
include barriers to germs, such as skin, mucous membranes, cilia,
stomach acid, inflammatory response, complement, and natural
killer cells, among others. Adaptive immunity develops in
response to exposure to antigens in one’s lifetime. With the
exception of antibodies passed from a mother to a nursing baby, it
is not passed to the next generation. Adaptive immunity is based on
specificity—the recognition of a particular antigen by its cell
surface markers or receptors.
T cells attack infected cells directly by cell-mediated
