etrads—line up at the metaphase plate. By contrast, you’ll recall
that in regular metaphase, the chromosomes line up individually. One important concept to note is that the alignment
during metaphase is random, so the copy of each chromosome that ends up in a daughter cell is random. Therefore,
the gamete will be created with a mixture of genetic information from the person’s father and mother. This means
that the offspring created would be a combination of all four grandparents.
Anaphase I
During anaphase I, each pair of chromatids within a tetrad moves to opposite poles. Notice that the chromatids do
not separate at the centromere. The homologs separate with their centromeres intact.
The chromosomes now move to their respective poles.
Telophase I
During telophase I, the nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes.
Finally, the cells undergo cytokinesis, leaving us with two daughter cells. Notice that at this point the nucleus
contains the haploid number of chromosomes, but
