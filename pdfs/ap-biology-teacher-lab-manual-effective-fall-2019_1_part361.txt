PHOTOSYNTHESIS
What factors affect the rate of photosynthesis in 
living leaves?
 
■BACKGROUND
Photosynthesis fuels ecosystems and replenishes the Earth’s atmosphere with oxygen. 
Like all enzyme-driven reactions, the rate of photosynthesis can be measured by either 
the disappearance of substrate or the accumulation of product (or by-products).
The general summary equation for photosynthesis is
2 H2O + CO2 + light → carbohydrate (CH2O) + O2 + H2O
What could you measure to determine the rate of photosyn
