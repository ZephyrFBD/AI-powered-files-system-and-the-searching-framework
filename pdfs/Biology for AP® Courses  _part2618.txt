Annual Rings
The activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. During the spring growing season, cells of the
secondary xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. This is known
as early wood, or spring wood. During the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late
wood, or autumn wood, which is denser than early wood. This alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal
decrease in the number of vessel elements and a seasonal increase in the number of tracheids. It results in the formation of
an annual ring, which can be seen as a circular ring in the cross section of the stem (Figure 23.12). An examination of the
number of
