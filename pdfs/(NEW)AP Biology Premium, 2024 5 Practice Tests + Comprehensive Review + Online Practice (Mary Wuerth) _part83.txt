 cooling effect.
12. (a) Arrow A indicates a hydrogen bond between water molecules.
(b) Oxygen has a much greater electronegativity than hydrogen does. So the electrons in the covalent bond
between oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule are not shared equally and form a polar covalent bond.
This gives the oxygen atom a partially negative charge and the hydrogen atom a partially positive charge.
(c) An ionic salt would dissolve more readily in water because the polar water molecules could form hydration
shells around the ions, as shown in the following figure.
Since methane is nonpolar, it could not form hydration shells around the ions.
(d) Polar water molecules cannot cross a waxy, nonpolar cuticle layer, so less water can evaporate from leaves
surrounded by a waxy, nonpolar cuticle.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) The aquatic snails in tubes B, C, and D all produced carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide combined with the
water in the tubes to form carbonic acid, which released H+ ions into
