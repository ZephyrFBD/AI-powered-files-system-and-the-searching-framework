ies faster than the
DNA cloning process previously described. Steps of the process are outline here:
1. DNA is heated. Heating denatures (separates) the hydrogen bonding holding the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
together and forms two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules.
2. DNA is cooled and single-stranded DNA primers are added. Two primers are added, each complementary to
the 3â€² end of the single strands of DNA. These single-stranded DNA primers serve the same purpose as RNA
primers during normal DNA replication
3. DNA polymerase is added. A special, heat-tolerant, DNA polymerase derived from bacteria adapted to living in
hot springs is added. The DNA polymerase attaches to the primers at each end of a single strand of DNA and
synthesizes a complementary DNA strand. At the end of this step, the one initial dsDNA molecule becomes two
dsDNA molecules.
4. Repeat the above steps. Each repetition of the sequence doubles the number of DNA molecules, and the total
number of molecules increa
