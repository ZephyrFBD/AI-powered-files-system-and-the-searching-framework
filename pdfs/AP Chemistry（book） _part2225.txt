CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
The compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are well-
known agents responsible for the destruction of Earth’s protective 
ozone layer. Another simple molecule that has the potential to destroy 
the stratospheric ozone layer is methyl bromide, CH3Br (Figure 14.11). 
Because this substance has a wide range of uses, including antifun-
gal treatment of plant seeds, it has been produced in large quantities 
in the past (about 150 million pounds per year worldwide in 1997, at 
the height of its production). In the stratosphere, the C ¬ Br bond is 
broken through absorption of short-wavelength radiation. The resul-
tant Br atoms then catalyze decomposition of O3.
Methyl bromide is removed from the lower atmosphere by a 
variety of mechanisms, including a slow reaction with ocean water:
