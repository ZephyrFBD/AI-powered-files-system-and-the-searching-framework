that is essential for coupling reactions and cellular work is ATP.
4. Exergonic reactions, like ATP → ADP, is an example of an energetically favorable reaction because it
allows for a negative change in free energy that will then be used to maintain or to increase order
within a system that is coupled by reactions that demonstrate changes in positive free energy.
5. The processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis are coupled to each other. The products of
one reaction end up being the reactants in the other.
6. Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation are examples of coupled reactions.
D. Modes of Energy Capture
1. Organisms can capture and store free energy for nutritional use in their biological systems.
i.
Autotrophs—“self-feeders,” create their own organic molecules or food; they are known as
producers.
ii. Heterotrophs—cannot create their own organic molecules or food; they are known as consumers.
Hydrolysis—helps them metabolize carbohydrates, proteins, and lipid
