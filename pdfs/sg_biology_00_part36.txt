Salinity
X.
Solution:
Any responses that mitigate high salt concentration
Examples:
Any example of a plant that regulates water uptake via
changes in water potential of root cells
Any example of a plant that regulates salt uptake due to
selective permeability of root cell membrane
Plants having salt glands (halophiles)
Herbicides

Solution:
Genetic-based resistance to chemicals, either synthetic or
naturally-occurring
Examples:
Any legitimate examples of such

Solution:
Any responses that mitigate cold temperatures
Examples:
Plants that change the angle at which the petiole is
presented in response to cold (e.g., rhododendron)
Plants displaying changes in lipid composi
