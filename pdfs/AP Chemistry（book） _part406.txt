n in chemi-
cal equations. We use the symbols ( g ), ( l ), (s), and (aq) for substances that are gases, liquids, sol-
ids, and dissolved in aqueous (water) solution, respectively. Thus, Equation 3.4  can be written
 
CH41g2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2 
[3.5] 
Sometimes symbols that represent the conditions under which the reaction proceeds ap-
pear above or below the reaction arrow. One example that we will encounter later in this 
chapter involves the symbol ∆ (Greek uppercase delta); a delta above the reaction arrow 
indicates the addition of heat.
In this reaction, there are two reactants, ethylene, C2H4, 
which is shown, and oxygen, O2, which is not shown, and 
two products, CO2 and H2O, both of which are shown.  
(a) Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction. 
(b) Determine the number of O2 molecules that should be 
shown in the left (reactants) box.
