nown as the plasma membrane. Although the plasma membrane appears to be a
simple thin layer surrounding the cell, itâ€™s actually a complex, double-layered structure made up of mostly
phospholipids and proteins. The hydrophobic fatty acid tails face inward and the hydrophilic phosphate heads face
outward. It is called a phospholipid bilayer since two lipid layers are forming a hydrophobic sandwich.
The plasma membrane is important because it regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell. The
membrane itself is semipermeable, meaning that only certain substances, namely small hydrophobic molecules (such
as O2 and CO2), pass through it unaided. Anything large and/or hydrophilic can pass through the membrane only via
special tunnels (discussed later in this chapter).
The surface area of a cell must be large enough to allow sufficient exchange of
materials. In general, smaller cells have a more favorable surface area-to-
volume ratio.
Many proteins are associated with the cel
