Use conservation of energy to determine the difference in
the speed of the two balls when they hit the ground. (Neglect
air resistance.)
79. The power supply for a pulsed nitrogen laser has a
capacitor with a maximum voltage rating of
35 kV. (a) Estimate how much energy could be stored in
this capacitor. (b) If 12% of this stored electrical energy is
converted to light energy in a pulse that is 6.2 microseconds
long, what is the power of the laser pulse?
80. In a photocell, ultraviolet (UV) light provides enough
energy to some electrons in barium metal to eject them
from the surface at high speed. To measure the maximum
energy of the electrons, another plate above the barium
surface is kept at a negative enough potential that the emitted
electrons are slowed down and stopped, and return to the
barium surface. See Fig.17–46. If the plate voltage is 
(compared to the barium) when the fastest electrons are
stopped, what was the speed of these electrons when they
were emitted?
