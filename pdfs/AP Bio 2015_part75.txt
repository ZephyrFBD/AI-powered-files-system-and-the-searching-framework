 this kind of imperfect repair, there may be a mismatched base 
pair in the DNA. The illustration below shows an example of a mismatch, with the relevant pair bases in bold. 
Which of the following best represents the DNA of the two daughter cells produced when a bacterial cell with 
this particular mismatch replicates its DNA and divides?

Iron is an essential nutrient that is acquired by organisms from the environment. When intracellular levels of iron 
are relatively high, living cells synthesize an iron-storage protein called ferritin. 
The induction of ferritin synthesis by iron was investigated in rats. Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment in 
which cellular levels of ferritin protein were measured in the presence or absence of iron and actinomycin D, a drug 
that inhibits transcription. 
Figure 2 shows the results of an ex
