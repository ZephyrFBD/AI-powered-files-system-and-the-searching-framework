 19.103  Most liquids follow Trouton’s rule (see Exercise 19.93), 
which states that the molar entropy of vaporization is 
approximately 88 { 5 J>mol@K. The normal boiling points 
and enthalpies of vaporization of several organic liquids 
are as follows:
Substance
Normal Boiling 
Point 1°C2
∆Hvap 1kJ>mol2
Acetone, 1CH322CO
    56.1
29.1
Dimethyl ether, 1CH322O
 -24.8

 (a) Calculate ∆Svap for each of the liquids. Do all the liquids 
obey Trouton’s rule? (b) With reference to intermolecular 
forces (Section 11.2), can you explain any exceptions to the 
rule? (c) Would you expect water to obey Trouton’s rule? By 
using data in Appendix B, check the accuracy of your con-
clusion. (d) Chlorobenzene
