wer surface tension. 
(d) Nonane has a viscosity of 7.11 * 10–4 kg/m-s at 20 °C. 
n-octyl alcohol, CH31CH227OH, has almost the same molec-
ular weight as nonane, but its viscosity is 1.01 * 10–2 kg/m-s 
at 20 °C. Which of the following statements is the most 
likely explanation for this phenomenon? (i) The stronger 
the intermolecular forces in a liquid, the smaller its viscos-
ity. (ii) The stronger the intermolecular forces in a liquid, the 
larger its viscosity.
 11.91  Acetone 31CH322CO4 is widely used as an industrial solvent. 
(a) Draw the Lewis structure for the acetone molecule and 
predict the geometry around each carbon atom. (b) Is the 
acetone molecule polar or nonpolar? (c) What kinds of 
intermolecular attractive forces exist between acetone mol-
ecules? (d) 1-Propanol 1CH3CH2CH2OH2 has a molecular 
weight that is very similar to that of acetone, yet acetone 
boils at 56.5 °C and 1-propanol boils at 97.2 °C. Explain the 
difference.
