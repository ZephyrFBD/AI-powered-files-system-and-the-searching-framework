 
3 elements and below; N and Ne are both in period 2 and do 
not undergo valence-shell expansion. Thus, the answer is P
.
(d) Period 2 nonmetals form p bonds more readily than elements 
in period 3 and below. There are no compounds known that 
contain covalent bonds to Ne. Thus, N is the element from 
the list that forms p bonds most readily.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which description correctly describes a difference between 
the chemistry of oxygen and sulfur?
(a) Oxygen is a nonmetal and sulfur is a metalloid. (b) Oxy-
gen can form more than four bonds, whereas sulfur cannot. 
(c) Sulfur has a higher electronegativity than oxygen.  
(d) Oxygen is better able to form p bonds than sulfur.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Of the elements Be, C, Cl, Sb, and Cs, which (a) has the low-
est electronegativity, (b) has the greatest nonmetallic char-
acter, (c) is most likely to participate in extensive p bonding, 
(d) is most likely to be a metalloid?
CO2;  C forms double bonds
