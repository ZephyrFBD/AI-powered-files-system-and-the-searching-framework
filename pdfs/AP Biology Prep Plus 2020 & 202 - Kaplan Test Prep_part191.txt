d are involved in a variety of metabolic functions, such as
catabolism of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, D-
amino acids, and polyamines, reduction of reactive oxygen species,
and biosynthesis of plasmalogens. (C) is incorrect because the electron
transport chain is located in the prokaryotic cell membrane, not the
cell wall.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle involved in
manufacturing lipids and proteins. The ER can be divided into the
rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) and smooth endoplasmic
reticulum (smooth ER). The rough ER is covered with ribosomes on its
outer surface that are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins.
The smooth ER functions mainly to manufacture lipids. Though they
are oȇen discussed as separate entities, they are, in fact, sub-
compartments of the same organelle. As a result, a drug targeting the
ER as a whole would cause a decrease in protein and lipid production.
