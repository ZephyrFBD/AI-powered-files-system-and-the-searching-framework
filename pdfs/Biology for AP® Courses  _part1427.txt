apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger
region over which recombination could occur. Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were
likely to be inherited together. The average number of crossovers between two alleles—that is, their recombination
frequency—correlated with their genetic distance from each other, relative to the locations of other genes on that
chromosome. Considering the example cross between AaBb and aabb above, the frequency of recombination could be
calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05. That is, the likelihood of a crossover between genes A/a and B/b was 0.05, or 5 percent.
Such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked, but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to
occasionally occur. Sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units, or centimorgans (cM), in which a recombination
frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.
