ionization energy of an atom is a measure of the energy change associated with 
removing an electron from the atom to form a cation. For example, the first ionization 
energy of Cl(g), 1251 kJ>mol, is the energy change associated with the process
 
Ionization energy: Cl1g2 ¡ Cl+1g2 + e-  
∆E = 1251 kJ>mol

The positive value of the ionization energy means that energy must be put into the atom 
to remove the electron. All ionization energies for atoms are positive: Energy must be absorbed 
to remove an electron.
Most atoms can also gain electrons to form anions. The energy change that occurs 
when an electron is added to a gaseous atom is called the electron affinity because it 
measures the attraction, or affinity, of the atom for the added electron. For most atoms, 
energy is released when an electron is added. For example, the addition of an electron to 
a chlorine atom is accompanied by an energy change of -349 kJ>mol, the negative sign 
indicating that
