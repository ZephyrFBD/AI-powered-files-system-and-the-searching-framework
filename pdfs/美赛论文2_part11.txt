λ: The number of susceptible people infected by one infective person 
every week. 
 μ: The proportion of dead and cured people in patients every week. 
3.1.2 Assumptions 
1) We divide the people into three types, including susceptible people, 
infective people and dead or cured people. 
2) When the infected people have recovered, they will never get infected 
again. 
3) The total number of population N is constant, regardless of new birth and 
death. 
4) When patient contact with susceptible people effectively, the susceptible 
would be infected.  
5) Assuming λ is constant.  
6) Assuming μ stay constant. 
7) When infective people die, the dead people will not infect other people 
during the circle. 
3.1.3 The Process of the Model 
 
 
 
3.1.4 The Foundation of Model1 
According to the assumptions，we set up a SIR model to solve the problem. 
At the prophase of the outbreak of Ebola (February, 2014 - February, 2015), 
due to invalid control without medicine, disease spread in the state
