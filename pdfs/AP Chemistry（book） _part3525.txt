different halogen atoms exist. These compounds are the simplest examples of interhal-
ogens, compounds, such as ClF and IF5, formed between two halogen elements.
The vast majority of the higher interhalogen compounds have a central Cl, Br, or I 
atom surrounded by fluorine atoms. The large size of the iodine atom allows the forma-
tion of IF3, IF5, and IF7, in which the oxidation state of I is +3, +5, and +7, respectively. 
With the smaller bromine and chlorine atoms, only compounds with three or five flu-
orines form. The only higher interhalogen compounds that do not have outer F atoms 
are ICl3 and ICl5; the large size of the I atom can accommodate five Cl atoms, whereas Br 
is not large enough to allow even BrCl3 to form. All of the interhalogen compounds are 
powerful oxidizing agents.
Oxyacids and Oxyanions
Table 22.3 summarizes the formulas of the known oxyacids of the halogens and the 
way they are named.*
