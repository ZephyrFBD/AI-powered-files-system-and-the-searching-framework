 of
a semipermeable membrane; hence, it possesses a lesser concentration of
particles, and loses water during osmosis
incomplete dominance
Genetic blending; each allele exerts some influence on the phenotype (for
example, red and white parents may yield pink oﬀspring)
Independent Assortment, Law of
Genes independently sort and do not aﬀect the sorting of other genes in
the formation of gametes in diploid organisms
indeterminate growth
Growth without a termination point
inducers
Molecules that bind to repressors and/or activators to increase gene
expression
induction
Initiating enzyme production or genetic transcription
ingestion
The intake of food from the environment into the alimentary canal
innate behaviors
Instinctive responses encoded in the genes of organisms
insertion
Addition of one or more nucleotides to a chromosome, usually by mutation
intercellular
Between cells
intermembrane space
Space between the outer and inner membranes of a mitochondrion
interphase
The cellular phase
