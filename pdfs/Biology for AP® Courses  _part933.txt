4.6 The student is able to use representations and models to analyze situations qualitatively
to describe how interactions of subcellular structures, which possess specialized functions,
provide essential functions.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:

How can light be used to make food? When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all
other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis,
light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use
