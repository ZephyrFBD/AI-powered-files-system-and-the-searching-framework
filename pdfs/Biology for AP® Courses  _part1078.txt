ing mechanisms. Yeasts use cell-surface receptors and signaling
cascades to communicate information on mating with other yeast cells. The signaling molecule secreted by yeasts is called
mating factor.
Bacterial signaling is called quorum sensing. Bacteria secrete signaling molecules called autoinducers that are either small,
hydrophobic molecules or peptide-based signals. The hydrophobic autoinducers, such as AHL, bind transcription factors
and directly affect gene expression. The peptide-based molecules bind kinases and initiate signaling cascades in the cells.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Which of the following properties prevents the ligands
of cell-surface receptors from entering the cell?
a.
The molecules bind to the extracellular domain.
b.

penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the plasma
membrane.

that deliver them through the bloodstream to
target cells.
