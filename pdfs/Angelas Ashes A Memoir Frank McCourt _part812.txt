Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder. 
 
 The priest whispers to me, These are bad women.We won’t stay 
 
 here long. 
 
 The bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. 
 
 What’s your name, honey? 
 
 Frank McCourt. 
 
 Nice name. So you take a little drink.All the Irish take a little drink. 
 
 You like a beer? 
 
 Yes, please. 
 
 Gee, so polite. I like the Irish.My grandmother was half Irish so that 
 
 makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here’s your 
 
 beer, honey. 
 
 The priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two 
 
 women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he’d like to see the 
 
 house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don’t have houses like this 
 
 in Ireland.Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what 
 
 they have growing in the garden, you wouldn’t believe the flowers. 
 
 Frieda asks me if I’m okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling 
 
 me where the lavatory is.
