Choices (C) and (D) can thus be eliminated. Muscles and neurons
are both terminally differentiated in G0 arrest. However, liver and taste buds potentially differ. Although liver
cells can divide, taste buds divide at a higher rate, so they are most likely to be in G2 phase. Therefore, the
answer is (B).

A
Nondisjunction results in major changes to the genome, so (B) and (C) can be eliminated. Deletion of an
enhancer, (D), could affect the gene expression and then phenotype. However, in (A), translocation may not
produce any effect, as the same information exists in the genome.
CHAPTER 8 DRILL: HEREDITY
1.
D
The father and mother are both AB blood type. Since neither parent has a recessive allele, it is impossible for
their child to be O blood type.
2.
B
When the phenotype associated with two traits is mixed, this is considered an example of incomplete
dominance. In this case, neither red nor blue is dominant, and the resulting progeny exhibited a mixture of the
traits (purple).
