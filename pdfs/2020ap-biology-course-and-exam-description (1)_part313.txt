he amount of energy available to producers in the lake increased.
(D)	The amount of energy available to consumers in the lake increased.
8.	 The enzyme trypsin aids in protein digestion in the small intestine. The relative

Figure 1. Effect of pH on the activity of trypsin
Which of the following statements best explains the activity levels of trypsin shown 
in Figure 1?
(A)	The small intestine releases inhibitor molecules that block the activity of 
trypsin unless it is at its optimum pH.
(B)	 The number of effective collisions between trypsin and its substrate increase 
at higher pH values.
(C)	 As pH values increase, the substrate concentration decreases, leading to an 
eventual decline in the rate of the trypsin-catalyzed reaction.
(D)	At extremely low pH values, trypsin is denatured and cannot function 
efficiently.
