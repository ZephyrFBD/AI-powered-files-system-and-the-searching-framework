a.
Compound leaves produce certain types of
chemical compounds that are harmful to
herbivores.
b.
It is more efficient for large herbivores to eat
large, simple leaves.
c.
Compound leaves are thicker than simple leaves.
d.
It is more efficient for large herbivores to eat the
small leaflets of compound leaves.
81. Stomata are usually found in higher numbers on the
abaxial or bottom surface of a leaf. What is the advantage
of such an arrangement?
a.
Presence of stomata on the abaxial or bottom
surface ensures that no, or very little, water is
lost due to guttation.
b.
The abaxial or bottom surface receives more
sunlight and water evaporates faster by
transpiration.
c.
Herbivores do not prefer to eat leaves with
stomata on the abaxial or bottom surface.
