DNA polymerase, RNA
polymerase adds nucleotides only to the 3′ side, therefore building a new molecule from 5′ to 3′. This means that
RNA polymerase must bind to the 3′ end of the template strand first (which would be the 5′ end of future mRNA).
RNA polymerase doesn’t need a primer, so it can just start transcribing the DNA right off the bat. The promoter
region is considered to be “upstream” of the actual coding part of the gene. This way the polymerase can get set up
before the bases it needs to transcribe, like a staging area before an official parade starting point. The official starting
point is called the start site.
When transcription begins, RNA polymerase travels along and builds an RNA that is complementary to the template
strand of DNA. It is just like DNA replication except when DNA has an adenine, the RNA can’t add a thymine since
RNA doesn’t have thymine. Instead, the enzyme adds a uracil.
Once RNA polymerase finishes adding on nucleotides and reaches the termination sequ
