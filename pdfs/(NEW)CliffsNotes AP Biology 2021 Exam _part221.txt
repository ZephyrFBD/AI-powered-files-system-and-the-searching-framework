The AP exam does not require you to use the names of the phases of the cell cycle (prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
telophase) in your responses. You would receive an equal amount of credit for your response if you omitted these
words and only described the events of meiosis in the correct sequence of occurrence. However, the names of the
phases are universally found in biology textbooks and are used here to provide you with the terminology that you
will find in your textbook. In the following descriptions, a word in parentheses highlights what happens in each
phase:
1. Prophase I (condensation) begins like prophase of mitosis. The nucleolus disappears, chromatin condenses into
chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the spindle apparatus develops. Unlike mitosis, however, once
the chromosomes are condensed, homologous chromosomes pair with each other, a process called synapsis. During
synapsis, corresponding regions along non sister chromatids form close associations
