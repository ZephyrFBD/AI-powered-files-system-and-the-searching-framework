concentration of final product. 
3. You and your students can use the amount of product formed overall to construct a 
graph and calculate enzyme reaction rate. 
■ Procedure 2: Determining the Effect of pH on Enzymatic 
Activity 
Numerous variables can be employed to observe the effects on the rate of an enzymatic 
reaction and possibly the specific fit of the enzyme with the substrate. In Procedure 
2, students examine the effects of various pH solutions via the color change and then 
compare their results by graphing pH versus color change (if using a spectrophotometer 
the pH to percent of light absorbance, as shown in the sample data table in Table 1).
