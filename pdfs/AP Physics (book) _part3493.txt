Limiting the dose. A worker in an
environment with a radioactive source is warned that she is accumulating a dose
too quickly and will have to lower her exposure by a factor of ten to continue
working for the rest of the year. If the worker is able to work farther away from
the source, how much farther away is necessary?
RESPONSE If the energy is radiated uniformly in all directions, then the
intensity (dose area) should decrease as the distance squared, just as it does for
sound and light. If she can work four times farther away, the exposure lowers by
a factor of sixteen, enough to make her safe.
Whole-body dose. What whole-body dose is received by
