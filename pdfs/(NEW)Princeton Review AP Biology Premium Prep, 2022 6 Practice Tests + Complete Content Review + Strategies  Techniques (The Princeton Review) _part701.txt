ng, so each is homozygous. That cross should
result in only green plants in the F1 generation. Crossing-over, (A), will not give variation because the
parental plants are homozygous. Their two copies are identical and crossing-over would just swap
identical genes. The law of independent assortment, (B), explains mixing of maternal and paternal
versions of the different chromosomes. The two homozygous dominant pea color alleles are on the two
copies of the same chromosome. A true breeding plant would also be unlikely to have gene alleles on
other chromosomes that impact the color. Choice (D) is correct because mutation can occur at any time
and result in changes to phenotype.

A
A yellow plant must be homozygous recessive (gg). All plants in the F1 generation are heterozygotes (Gg)
because the parents are a homozygous dominant (GG) and a homozygous recessive (gg). As shown in the
Punnett square below, the ratio of green:yellow would be 1:1.

B
The passage does not say that the conta
