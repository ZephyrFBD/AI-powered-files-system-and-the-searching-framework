(A) The mitochondrion is the only location in
which eukaryotic cells can synthesize ATP. 
(B) An ancestral cell most likely engulfed an
aerobic prokaryote in a relationship that 
proved beneficial for both cells. 
(C) Mitochondrial membranes provide abundant 
surface area for reactions because of the 
infoldings called cristae. 
(D) The mitochondrion plays a role in respiration, 
but it also stores the cellâ€™s extra mRNA.

3. Sickle-cell anemia is associated with a mutation
in the gene encoding the beta subunit of
hemoglobin that results in a change from glutamic
acid to valine at position 6. All other amino acids
are identical to a normal hemoglobin molecule.
Based on the information above, which of the
following mutations is the most likely cause of
sickle-cell anemia?
(A) A single base-pair substitution in the gene
encoding the beta subunit 
(B) A single base-pair insertion i
