like the collisions of perfectly elastic billiard balls (Chapter 7).
We assume the collisions are of very short duration compared to the time
between collisions. Then we can ignore the potential energy associated with
collisions in comparison to the kinetic energy between collisions.

We can see how this kinetic view of a gas can explain Boyle’s law (Section 13–5).
The pressure exerted on a wall of a container of gas is due to the constant bom-
bardment of molecules. If the volume is reduced by (say) half, the molecules are
closer together and twice as many will be striking a given area of the wall per second.
Hence we expect the pressure to be twice as great, in agreement with Boyle’s law.
Now let us calculate quantitatively the pressure a gas exerts on its container in
terms of microscopic quantities.We imagine that the molecules are inside a rectangular
container (at rest) whose ends have area A and whose length is 
as shown in
