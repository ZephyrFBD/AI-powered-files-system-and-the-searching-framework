reported confirmed Ebola cases as 
the epidemic areas. According to the WHO’s reports, there are 14 cities 
have been infected in Sierra Leone until now. We mark these epidemic 
areas with A1, A2,…, A14. Details refer to Table 2. 
3) We simplify the distance between epidemic areas or treatment center and 
epidemic area as the linear distance between two points on Rectangular 
Plane Coordinate System. 
4) The demand of drugs of each epidemic area is relation to the confirmed 
cases in this area. Assume they have a linear relation. 
5) The increase cases of next circle will obey the SIR model. 
6) There are enough vehicles in treatment center and epidemic areas to 
ensure all of the drugs and vaccines could be delivered once every time. 
7) Each infected person needs a unit of drugs, and each susceptible person 
need a unit of vaccine. 
8) The cost of every unit of distance is the same. 
9) Only if one epidemic area can meet the demand of itself, that it can 
deliver vaccines and drugs t
