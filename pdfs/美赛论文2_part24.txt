 circle. 
Vertical transportation means medication is carried from treatment center to 
epidemic areas. 
Lateral transportation means medication is carried between epidemic areas. 
But the two models based on the common assumption that the position of 
treatment center is determined.  
3.5.1 Determination of Treatment Center 
3.5.1.1 Terms , Definitions and Symbols 
 Ai: The code of epidemic cities ( i=1, 2, 3…) 
 (xi, yi): The location of the epidemic city in the map 
 t1i : time of the one-way distribution from treatment center to the 
epidemic city(Ai) 
 Si : the straight-line distance from treatment center to the epidemic 
cities(Ai) 
 di: The amount of the medication the epidemic city(Ai) needed 
3.5.1.2 Assumptions 
1) di is proportion to the cases in epidemic cities during the recent 3 weeks. 
2) t1i is proportion to Si* di. 
3.5.1.3 Result   
To give a result, we gain the data of Sierra Leone from WHO, which is
