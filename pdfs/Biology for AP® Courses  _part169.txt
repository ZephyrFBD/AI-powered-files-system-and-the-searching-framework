excess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction. However, the
carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate
ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action. These reactions are important
for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood.

Ions and Ionic Bonds
Some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. This fills their outermost
electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of
protons, each ion has a net charge. Cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons. Negative ions are formed
by gaining electrons and are called anions. Anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in “-ide”:
the anion of chlorine is cal
