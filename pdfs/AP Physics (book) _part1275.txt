Loudness is a sensation in the consciousness of a human being and is related to 
a physically measurable quantity, the intensity of the wave. Intensity is defined 
as the energy transported by a wave per unit time across a unit area perpendicular to
the energy flow.As we saw in Chapter 11, intensity is proportional to the square of the
wave amplitude. Intensity has units of power per unit area, or 
An average human ear can detect sounds with an intensity as low as
and as high as 
(and even higher, although above this it is
painful). This is an incredibly wide range of intensity, spanning a factor of 
from lowest to highest. Presumably because of this wide range, what we perceive
as loudness is not directly proportional to the intensity. To produce a sound that
sounds about twice as loud requires a sound wave that has about 10 times the
intensity. This is roughly valid at any sound level for frequencies near the middle
of the audible range. For example, a sound wave of intensity
