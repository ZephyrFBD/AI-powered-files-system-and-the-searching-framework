 becoming smaller in size through adulthood. The
thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response.
Adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body. It produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake.
Leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety
after eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. Leptin is also associated with reproduction. It
must be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if
adipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.
