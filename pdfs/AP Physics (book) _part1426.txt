r all gases is a remarkable
reflection of simplicity in nature. It was first recognized, although in a slightly 
different form, by the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). Avogadro
stated that equal volumes of gas at the same pressure and temperature contain
equal numbers of molecules. This is sometimes called Avogadro’s hypothesis.
That this is consistent with R being the same for all gases can be seen as follows.
From Eq. 13–3,
we see that for the same number of moles, n, and the
same pressure and temperature, the volume will be the same for all gases as long
as R is the same. Second, the number of molecules in 1 mole is the same for all
gases (see page 369). Thus Avogadro’s hypothesis is equivalent to R being the same
for all gases.
The number of molecules in one mole of any pure substance is known as
Avogadro’s number,
Although Avogadro conceived the notion, he was not
able to actually determine the value of 
Indeed, precise measurements were
not done until the twentieth
