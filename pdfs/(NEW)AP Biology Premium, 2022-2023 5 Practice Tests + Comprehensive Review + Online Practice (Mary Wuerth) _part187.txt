ing all the reactions associated with photosynthesis, it is important to understand the basics of this
process. Here is the overall equation for photosynthesis:
Note that during photosynthesis, the carbon atoms from carbon dioxide gain hydrogen atoms (carbon is reduced) and
the oxygen atoms in water lose hydrogen atoms (oxygen is oxidized).
TIP
An easy way to remember the difference between oxidation and reduction is the mnemonic device OILRIG: Oxidation Is Losing hydrogen
atoms; Reduction Is Gaining hydrogen atoms.
Photosynthesis can be divided into two main partsâ€”the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent
reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle), as shown in Figure 8.1. The light-dependent reactions use energy from
sunlight to split water, producing oxygen gas, protons, and high-energy electrons. Oxygen gas is released into the
atmosphere. The protons and high-energy electrons are used to power the production of ATP and NADPH (which
are sent to the light-independent re
