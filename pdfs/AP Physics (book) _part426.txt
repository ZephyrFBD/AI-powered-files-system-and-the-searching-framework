m high.
When he strikes the ground below, he bends his knees so
that his torso decelerates over an approximate distance of
0.70 m. If the mass of his torso (excluding legs) is 42 kg,
find (a) his velocity just before his feet strike the ground,
and (b) the average force exerted on his torso by his legs
during deceleration.

27. (II) A train locomotive is pulling two cars of the same mass
behind it, Fig. 4–51. Determine the ratio of the tension in
the coupling (think of it as a cord) between the locomotive
and the first car 
to that between the first car and the
second car 
for any nonzero acceleration of the train.
