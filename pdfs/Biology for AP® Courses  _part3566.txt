All aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree, different
organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere. The environment in which
the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the respiratory system is correlated with the
size of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops.
In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (Figure 30.2).

Diffusion is a slow, passive transport process. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell,
the rate of oxygen uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if
