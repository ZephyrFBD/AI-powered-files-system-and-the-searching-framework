Registered dietitians help plan nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. They often work with
patients in health care facilities, designing nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases. For example,
dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types
and amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.
To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelorâ€™s degree in dietetics, nutrition,
food technology, or a related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship
program and pass a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition,
chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians must become experts in
the chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).
