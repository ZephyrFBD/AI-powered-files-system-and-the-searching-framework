re a special type of
lipid associated with cell membranes and typically have a glycerol (or sphingosine) backbone to which two fatty acid chains
and a phosphate-containing group are attached. As a result, phospholipids are considered amphipathic because they have
both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. (In Chapters 4 and 5 we will explore in more detail how the amphipathic
nature of phospholipids in plasma cell membranes helps regulate the passage of substances into and out of the cell.)
Although the molecular structures of steroids differ from that of triglycerides and phospholipids, steroids are classified as
lipids based on their hydrophobic properties. Cholesterol is a type of steroid in animal cells’ plasma membrane. Cholesterol
is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.
