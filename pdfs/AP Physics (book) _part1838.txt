FIGURE 17–2 Central part of
Fig. 17–1, showing a negative point
charge near the negative plate.
Example 17–1.
A negative charge. Suppose a negative
charge, such as an electron, is placed near the negative plate in Fig. 17–1, at 
point b, shown here in Fig. 17–2. If the electron is free to move, will its electric
potential energy increase or decrease? How will the electric potential change?
RESPONSE An electron released at point b will be attracted to the positive plate.
As the electron accelerates toward the positive plate, its kinetic energy increases,
so its potential energy decreases:
and
But
note that the electron moves from point b at low potential to point a at higher
potential:
(Potentials 
and 
are due to the charges on
the plates, not due to the electron.) The signs of 
and 
are opposite
because of the negative charge of the electron.
NOTE A positive charge placed next to the negative plate at b would stay there,
with no acceleration. A posi
