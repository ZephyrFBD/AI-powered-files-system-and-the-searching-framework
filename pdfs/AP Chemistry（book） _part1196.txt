ove across a period of the periodic table, why do 
the sizes of the transition elements change more gradually 
than those of the representative elements?
 7.83  In the series of group 5A hydrides, of general formula 
MH3, the measured bond distances are P¬H, 1.419 Å; 
As¬ H, 1.519 Å; Sb¬ H, 1.707 Å. (a) Compare these val-
ues with those estimated by use of the atomic radii in 
Figure 7.7. (b) Explain the steady increase in M¬H bond 
distance in this series in terms of the electron conﬁgura-
tions of the M atoms.
 7.84  In Table 7.8, the bonding atomic radius of neon is listed as 
0.58 Å, whereas that for xenon is listed as 1.40 Å. A class-
mate of yours states that the value for Xe is more realistic 
than the one for Ne. Is she correct? If so, what is the basis 
for her statement?
 7.85  The As¬As bond length in elemental arsenic is 2.48 Å. The 
Cl¬ Cl bond length in Cl2 is 1.99 Å. (a) Based on these data, 
what is the predicted As¬Cl bond length in arsenic trichlo-
ride, AsCl3, in whi
