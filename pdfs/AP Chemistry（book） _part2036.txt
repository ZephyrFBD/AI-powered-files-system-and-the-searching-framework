ed, all of the solute may remain dissolved even though its solubility 
decreases as the temperature decreases. Because the solute in a supersaturated solution is 
present in a concentration higher than the equilibrium concentration, supersaturated solu-
tions are unstable with respect to crystallization of the solute. For crystallization to occur, 
however, the solute particles must arrange themselves properly to form crystals. The addi-
tion of a small crystal of the solute (a seed crystal) provides a template for crystallization of 
the excess solute, leading to a saturated solution in contact with excess solid (Figure 13.7).

How many grams of sodium acetate are in solution in the third beaker?
Amount of sodium acetate
dissolved is greater than its
solubility at this temperature.
2 Excess sodium acetate
starts to crystallize from 
solution.
1 Seed crystal of sodium 
acetate is added to 
supersaturated solution.
3 Solution is 
saturated and 
excess solute has 
crystallized.
