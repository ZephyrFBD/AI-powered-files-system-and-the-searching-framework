and ∆T
f. We add ∆T
b to the boiling point and ∆T
f to the freezing 
point of the solvent to obtain the boiling point and freezing point 
of the solution.
Osmosis
Certain materials, including many membranes in biological systems and synthetic sub-
stances such as cellophane, are semipermeable. When in contact with a solution, these 
materials allow only ions or small molecules—water molecules, for instance—to pass 
through their network of tiny pores.
Consider a situation in which only solvent molecules are able to pass through a semi-
permeable membrane placed between two solutions of different concentrations. The rate 
at which the solvent molecules pass from the less concentrated solution (lower solute con-
centration but higher solvent concentration) to the more concentrated solution (higher 
solute concentration but lower solvent concentration) is greater than the rate in the oppo-
site direction. Thus, there is a net movement of
