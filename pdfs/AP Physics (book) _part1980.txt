ity of any value (say, in a handbook
of physical data). If the temperature range is wide, Eq. 18–4 is not adequate and
terms proportional to the square and cube of the temperature are needed, but
these terms are generally very small except when 
is large.

18–5 Electric Power
Electric energy is useful to us because it can be easily transformed into other
forms of energy. Motors transform electric energy into mechanical energy, and
are examined in Chapter 20.
In other devices such as electric heaters, stoves, toasters, and hair dryers,
electric energy is transformed into thermal energy in a wire resistance known as a
“heating element.” And in an ordinary lightbulb, the tiny wire filament (Fig. 18–5
and Chapter-Opening Photo) becomes so hot it glows; only a few percent of the
energy is transformed into visible light, and the rest, over 90%, into thermal energy.
Lightbulb filaments and heating elements (Fig.18–16) in household appliances have
resistances typically of a few ohms t
