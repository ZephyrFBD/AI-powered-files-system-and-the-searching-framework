Although migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration).
Animals that exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not. Additionally, in some animals, only a portion of
the population migrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration). For example, owls that live in the tundra
may migrate in years when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when
rodents are plentiful.
Foraging
Foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources. Feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and
minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section.
