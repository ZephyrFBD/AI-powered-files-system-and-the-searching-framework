h Patricia Madigan and that poem I 
 
 can’t have the privilege anymore. She says I’ll be going home in a few 
 
 weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk 
 
 again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow 
 
 after breakfast. I don’t know why she says I have to learn how to 
 
 walk when I’ve been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse 
 
 stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, 
 
 See, you’re a baby again. 
 
 I practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. 
 
 I don’t want to be a baby. I don’t want to be in this empty ward with 
 
 no Patricia and no highwayman and no red-lipped landlord’s daughter. 
 
 I don’t want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony 
 
 fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar. 
 
 Seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman 
 
 poem and it has a very sad end.Would I like him to say it becau
