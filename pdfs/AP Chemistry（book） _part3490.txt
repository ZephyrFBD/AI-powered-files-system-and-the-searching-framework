The chemistry exhibited by the first member of a nonmetal group can differ from 
that of subsequent members in important ways. Two differences are particularly notable:
t The ﬁrst member is able to accommodate fewer bonded neighbors. 
 (Section 8.7) 
For example, nitrogen is able to bond to a maximum of three Cl atoms, NCl3, whereas 
phosphorus can bond to ﬁve, PCl5. The small size of nitrogen is largely responsible 
for this difference.
t The ﬁrst member can more readily form p bonds and hence double and triple bonds. 
This trend is also due, in part, to size because small atoms are able to approach 
each other more closely. As a result, the overlap of p orbitals, which results in the 
formation of p bonds, is more effective for the ﬁrst element in each group (Fig- 
ure 22.2). More effective overlap means stronger p bonds, reﬂected in bond enthal-
pies.
