Question 5 
 
  The pTET-KAN plasmid carries an origin of replication (ori) and genes conferring resistance to the 
antibiotics tetracycline (tet) and kanamycin (kan) as represented in the figure. Cultures of E. coli 
bacteria were transformed with the plasmid. To determine the success of the transformation 
experiment, the bacterial cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline overnight.  
(a) Predict the most likely outcome of culturing transformed E. coli in the presence of tetracycline. 
Justify your prediction. (2 points) 
Prediction (1 point) 
• Cells will reproduce/grow 
• Cultures will grow 
• Bacterial population will increase in size 
• Untransformed cells will not reproduce/grow 
 
Justification (1 point) 
• Expression of the tet-resistance gene  
• Synthesis of tet-resistance protein
