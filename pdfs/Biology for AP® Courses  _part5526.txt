 the fact
that she had no known medical issues or conditions. Her family
sought an autopsy, but Dr Erik Christensen, Utah’s chief medical
examiner, said proving vaccine injury as a cause of death almost
never happened. He could think of only one instance where an
autopsy would name a vaccine as the oﬃcial cause of death and that
would be anaphylaxis where someone received a vaccine and died
almost instantaneously. ‘Short of that, it would be diﬃcult for us to
deﬁnitively say this is the vaccine,’ Christensen said. If that is true
this must be added to the estimated ten percent (or far less)
reporting rate of vaccine deaths and serious reactions and the
conclusion can only be that vaccine deaths and serious reactions –
including these ‘Covid’ potions’ – are phenomenally understated in
oﬃcial ﬁgures. The same story can be found everywhere. Endless
accounts of deaths and serious reactions among the public, medical
and care home staﬀ while oﬃcial ﬁgures did not even begin to
reﬂect this.
