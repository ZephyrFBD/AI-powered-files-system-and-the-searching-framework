r(s) in the food web. Explain your reasoning.
(c) Many species of phytoplankton occur in marine environments, but not all are digestible or desirable to eat.
One species of phytoplankton, Coccolithophore, are not a food source. Predict the effect of a
Coccolithophore bloom on this aquatic ecosystem.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
5. A portion of the human immune system response to an invading pathogen is shown in the figure.
Macrophages are white blood cells that ingest invading pathogens. After digesting the pathogen, macrophages
present the antigens from the pathogen to helper T cells in the immune system. These helper T cells then secrete
chemical signals called cytokines. The cytokines can travel short distances to activate nearby cytotoxic T cells,
which will kill infected cells. Some cytokines will activate the enzyme adenylyl cyclase in nearby B cells to
produce cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP will then activate the production of antibodies in the B cells.
(a) Describe the c
