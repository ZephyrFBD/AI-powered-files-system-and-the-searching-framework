trons in the outer shell of the atom. The values of 
I1-I4 increase as expected. I5 and I6 represent loss of the 1s core elec-
trons. These 1s electrons are much closer to the nucleus and experi-
ence the full nuclear charge, so the values of I5 and I6 are signiﬁcantly 
greater than I1-I4. 7.96 (a) Cl-, K+ (b) Mn2 +, Fe3 +  (c) Sn2 +, Sb3 +   
7.99 (a) For both H and the alkali metals, the added electron will 
complete an ns subshell, so shielding and repulsion effects will be 
similar. For the halogens, the electron is added to an np subshell, so 
the energy change is likely to be quite different. (b) True. The electron 
conﬁguration of H is 1s1. The single 1s electron experiences no repul-
sion from other electrons and feels the full unshielded nuclear charge. 
The outer electrons of all other elements that form compounds are 
shielded by a spherical inner core of electrons and are less strongly 
attracted to the nucleus, resulting in larger bonding atomic radii.  
(c) Both H and the
