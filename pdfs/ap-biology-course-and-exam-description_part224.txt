maries/Questions 
Students can perform the “hula hoop diversity” activity. Divide students into groups, 
and give each group a hula hoop and a magnifying glass. Students should place their 
hula hoop in a grassy/woodsy area or garden and then make observations and collect 
a variety of data from their sampling area about the plants, animals, and abiotic factors 
inside the hula hoop. At the conclusion of the activity, have students predict what will 
happen to organisms in an ecosystem when its biodiversity changes, discuss the 
relationship between biodiversity and species endangerment, and predict what changes 
might occur in an ecosystem when a biotic or abiotic factor changes.
