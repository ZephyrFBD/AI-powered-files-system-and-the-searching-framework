Assumes both volume and shape of its 
container
Assumes shape of portion of container it 
occupies
Retains own shape and volume
Expands to fill its container
Does not expand to fill its container

Diffusion within a gas occurs rapidly
Diffusion within a liquid occurs slowly
Diffusion within a solid occurs extremely 
slowly
*The atoms in a solid are able to vibrate in place. As the temperature of the solid increases, the 
vibrational motion increases.

Figure 11.2 compares the three states of matter. The state of a substance depends largely 
on the balance between the kinetic energies of the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) and the 
interparticle energies of
