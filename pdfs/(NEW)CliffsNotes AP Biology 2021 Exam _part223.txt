ies begin cytokinesis and form cleavage furrows or cell plates. In
other species, cytokinesis is delayed until after meiosis II. Also, a short interphase II may begin. In any case, no
replication of chromosomes occurs during this period. Instead, part II of meiosis begins in both daughter nuclei.
5. In prophase II (condensation), the nuclear envelope disappears and the spindle develops. There are no chiasmata
and no crossing over of genetic material as in prophase I.
6. In metaphase II (alignment), the chromosomes align singly on the metaphase plate (not in pairs, as in metaphase
I). Single alignment of chromosomes is exactly what happens in mitosis except here, in meiosis, there is only half
the number of chromosomes.
7. Anaphase II (separation) begins as each chromosome is pulled apart into two chromatids by the microtubules of
the spindle apparatus. The chromatids (now chromosomes) migrate to their respective poles. Again, this is exactly
what happens in mitosis, except that now the
