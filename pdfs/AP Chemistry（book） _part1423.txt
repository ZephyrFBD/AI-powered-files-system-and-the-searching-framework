tals, one on each 
carbon atom. Two electrons are used in forming the C ¬C s bond. Next, the C ¬H s 
bonds are formed by overlap of the remaining sp2 hybrid orbitals on the C atoms with the 
1s orbitals on each H atom. We use eight more electrons to form these four C ¬H bonds. 
Thus, 10 of the 12 valence electrons in the C2H4 molecule are used to form five s bonds.
The remaining two valence electrons reside in the unhybridized 2p orbitals, one 
electron on each carbon. These two orbitals can overlap sideways with each other, as 
shown in Figure 9.22. The resulting electron density is concentrated above and below the 
C ¬C bond axis: It is a p bond (Figure 9.20). Thus, the C “C double bond in ethylene 
consists of one s bond and one p bond.
Although we cannot experimentally observe a p bond directly (all we can observe 
are the positions of the atoms), the structure of ethylene provides strong support for 
its presence. First, the C ¬C bond length in ethylene (1.34 Å) is much shorter th
