eet Mephistophilis, thou pleasest me. Whilst I am here
on earth, let me be cloy'd With all things that delight the heart of man: My
four-and-twenty years of liberty I'll spend in pleasure and in dalliance,
That Faustus' name, whilst<111> this bright frame doth stand, May be
admir'd thorough<112> the furthest land.
MEPHIST. 'Tis well said, Faustus.  Come, then, stand by me, And
thou shalt see them come immediately.
FAUSTUS. Nay, stay, my gentle Mephistophilis, And grant me
my<113> request, and then I go. Thou know'st, within the compass of
eight days We view'd the face of heaven, of earth, and hell; So high our
dragons soar'd into the air, That, looking down, the earth appear'd to me
No bigger than my hand in quantity; There did we view the kingdoms of
the world, And what might please mine eye I there beheld. Then in this
show let me an actor be, That this proud Pope may Faustus' cunning<114>
see.
MEPHIST. Let it be so, my Faustus.  But, first, stay, And view their
triumphs as they pass
