The Concept of Equilibrium 
625
In this and the next two chapters, we will explore chemical equilibrium in detail. 
Later, in Chapter 19, we will learn how to relate chemical equilibria to thermodynamics. 
Here, we learn how to express the equilibrium state of a reaction in quantitative terms 
and study the factors that determine the relative concentrations of reactants and prod-
ucts in equilibrium mixtures.
15.1 ∣ The Concept of Equilibrium
Let’s examine a simple chemical reaction to see how it reaches an equilibrium 
state—a mixture of reactants and products whose concentrations no longer change 
with time. We begin with N2O4, a colorless substance that dissociates to form brown 
NO2. Figure 15.2 shows a sample of frozen N2O4 inside a sealed tube. The solid N2O4 
be
