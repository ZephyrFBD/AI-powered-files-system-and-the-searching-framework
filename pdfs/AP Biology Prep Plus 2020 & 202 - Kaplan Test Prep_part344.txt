The x-intercept is the same for all of the reactions, so the
maximum velocity must be the same with and without the
inhibitor. This is competitive inhibition because high
concentrations of substrate can outcompete a competitive
inhibitor.
(A)
The y-intercept is diﬀerent for all of the reactions, so the
maximum velocity must be lower with the inhibitor. This is
noncompetitive inhibition because high concentrations of
substrate can outcompete a competitive inhibitor and reach
the same maximum velocity.
(B)
The y-intercept is the same for all of the reactions, so the
maximum velocity must be the same with and without the
inhibitor. This is competitive inhibition because high
concentrations of substrate can outcompete a competitive

The x-intercept is diﬀerent for all of the reactions, so the
maximum velocity must be less with the inhibitor. This is
