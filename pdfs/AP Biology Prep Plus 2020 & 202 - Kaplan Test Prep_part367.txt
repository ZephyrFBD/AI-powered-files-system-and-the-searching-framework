 velocity at a much higher substrate concentration
than the mutant enzyme and also has lower substrate
specificity.
(B)
The wild type enzyme works less eﬀiciently with NADP+ than
the mutant enzyme. With this cofactor, it reaches the
maximum velocity at a much lower substrate concentration
and also has lower substrate specificity.
(C)
The wild type enzyme works more eﬀiciently with NADP+
than the mutant enzyme. With this cofactor, it reaches the
maximum velocity at a much lower substrate concentration
than the mutant enzyme and also has higher substrate
specificity.

4. Protein kinase C (PKC) can be inhibited by multiple inhibitors.
Some are competitive inhibitors, but others are not. Which of the
findings below would suggest competitive inhibition?
The reaction reaches the same maximum velocity with or
without the inhibitor, although at diﬀerent substrate
concentrations.
(A)
The inhibitor is found to bind to the enzyme relatively far
from its active site.
(B)
Increasing the concentr
