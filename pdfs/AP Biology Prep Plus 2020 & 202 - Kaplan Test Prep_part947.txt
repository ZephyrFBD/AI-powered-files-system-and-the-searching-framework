t lightning was a source of
energy for the synthesis of the first organic molecules, as in (C). (A) and
(B) both involve organisms, so they could not explain the rise of
organic molecules that predated life. (D) is incorrect because ocean
currents do not factor into any of the currently accepted hypotheses
about the origin of life on Earth.
26. D
DNA and the genetic code that translates nucleotide sequences to
amino acids is universal across organisms. Thus, it makes no
diﬀerence whether a gene comes from bacteria, from sheep, or even
from artificial synthesis using biotechnology—irrespective of origin, a
cell can translate a gene into a protein. (D) is thus correct. All of the
other choices present plausible reasons for the lack of bacterial
growth.

The section of the graph indicated by A includes individuals with the
largest trait size in the original population. In the current population,
none of the existing individuals possess a trait size so large, because
the curve has shi
