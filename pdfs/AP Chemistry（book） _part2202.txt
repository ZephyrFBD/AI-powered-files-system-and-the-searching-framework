ining different numbers of 
spheres representing mixtures containing different reactant con-
centrations. We are asked to use the given rate law and the com-
positions of the boxes to rank the mixtures in order of increasing 
reaction rates.
Plan Because all three boxes have the same volume, we can put the 
number of spheres of each kind into the rate law and calculate the 
rate for each box.

Magnitudes and Units of Rate Constants
If chemists want to compare reactions to evaluate which ones are relatively fast and 
which ones are relatively slow, the quantity of interest is the rate constant. A good gen-
eral rule is that a large value of k (âˆ¼109 or higher) means a fast reaction and a small value 
of k (10 or lower) means a slow reaction.
The units of the rate constant depend on the overall reaction order of the rate law. 
In a reaction that is second order overall, for example, the units of the rate constant must 
satisfy the equation:
 
Units of rate = 1units of rate cons
