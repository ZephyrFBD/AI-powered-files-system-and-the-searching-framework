mined by averaging the two middle numbers. Therefore, the
median is not necessarily one of the numbers in the dataset. The median is useful in gauging the midpoint of the
data, but will not necessarily tell you much about outliers.
The mode is the most frequently recurring number in the dataset. If there are no numbers that occur more than once,
there is no mode. If there are multiple numbers that occur most frequently, each of those numbers is a mode. The
mode must be one of the numbers in the sample, and modes are never averaged.
The range is the difference between the smallest and largest number in a sample. This value is less useful than
standard deviation, because it does not give any information on individual values or the majority of values.
Example 1: Eleven male laboratory mice were weighed at 32 weeks of age. The data collected was: 32 g, 28 g, 29
g, 34 g, 30 g, 28 g, 32 g, 31 g, 30 g, 32 g, 33 g. What is the mean, median, and mode of this dataset?
