the indicator is yellow. Refer to the diagram below.
If the level of CO2 decreases, the indicator turns green. With all CO2
removed, the indicator turns blue. You place container A in normal
sunlight, container B under green light only, and container C under red
light only. You then observe the three vessels after 24 hours.
Predict what you will observe after 24 hours.
The water in container B will turn blue.
The water in container B will turn green.
The water in container C will be unchanged.
The water in container C will be blue.
Which of the following choices accurately explains why the
absorption of CO2 is an appropriate indicator of photosynthesis?
Plants produce CO2 in the light-independent reactions.
Plants require CO2 to produce sugars.
CO2 is needed to produce ATP in the light-dependent reactions.
CO2 is needed to produce ATP in the light-independent
reactions.
