nd with two hydrogens. Because carbon has four 
valence electrons, after sp2 hybridization one electron in each carbon remains in the 
unhybridized 2p orbital. Note that this unhybridized 2p orbital is directed perpendicular 
to the plane that contains the three sp2 hybrid orbitals.
Let’s go through the steps of building the bonds in the ethylene molecule. Each sp2 
hybrid orbital on a carbon atom contains one electron. Figure 9.22 shows how we can first

Remember that p orbitals 
have two lobes, so the p 
bond also has two lobes, one 
above and the other below 
the molecular plane.

Why is it important that the sp2 hybrid orbitals of the two  
carbon atoms lie in the same plane?
