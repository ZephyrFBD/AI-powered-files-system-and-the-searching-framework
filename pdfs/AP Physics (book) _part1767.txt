o the given field on a
positive test charge. The lines of force due to a single isolated positive charge are
shown in Fig. 16–31a, and for a single isolated negative charge in Fig. 16–31b. In
part (a) the lines point radially outward from the charge, and in part (b) they point
radially inward toward the charge because that is the direction the force would be
on a positive test charge in each case (as in Fig. 16–26). Only a few representative
lines are shown. We could draw lines in between those shown since the electric field
exists there as well. We can draw the lines so that the number of lines starting on a
positive charge, or ending on a negative charge, is proportional to the magnitude 
of the charge. Notice that nearer the charge, where the electric field is greater
the lines are closer together. This is a general property of electric
field lines: the closer together the lines are, the stronger the electric field in that
region. In fact, field lines can be drawn so that the number
