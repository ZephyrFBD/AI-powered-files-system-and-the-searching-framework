Figure 18.21 The shape of the male reproductive organ varies among male damselfly species, and is only compatible
with the female of the same species. Reproductive organ incompatibility keeps each species reproductively isolated.
In plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from
accessing the pollen. The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which
prevents the plant from being cross-pollinated with a different species (Figure 18.22).
Figure 18.22 Some flowers have evolved to attract certain pollinators. The (a) wide foxglove flower is adapted for
pollination by bees, while the (b) long, tube-shaped trumpet creeper flower is adapted for pollination by hummingbirds.
