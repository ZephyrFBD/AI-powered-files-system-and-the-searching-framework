out by gravity. When a small scrap of paper is placed onto the droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet
even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. Cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bonds of water
molecules intact and support the item floating on the top. It’s even possible to “float” a needle on top of a glass of water if

it is placed gently without breaking the surface tension, as shown in Figure 2.17.
Figure 2.17 The weight of the needle is pulling the surface downward; at the same time, the surface tension is pulling
it up, suspending it on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around
the needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)
These cohesive forces are related to water’s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other
molecules. This attraction is sometimes stronger than water’s cohesive forces, especially when the water
