 5.86 (a) The nitrogen atoms in an N2 molecule are held together 
by a triple bond; use enthalpies of formation in Appen-
dix C to estimate the enthalpy of this bond, D(N ‚ N). (b) 
Consider the reaction between hydrazine and hydrogen to 
produce ammonia, N2H41g2 + H21g2 ¡ 2 NH31g2. Use en-
thalpies of formation and bond enthalpies to estimate the en-
thalpy of the nitrogen– nitrogen bond in N2H4. (c) Based on 
your answers to parts (a) and (b), would you predict that the 
 
nitrogen–nitrogen bond in hydrazine is weaker than, similar 
to, or stronger than the bond in N2 ?

 The complete combustion of one mole of this com-
pound to CO21g2 and H2O1g2 leads to ∆H° = -5064.9 kJ.  
(a) Write a balanced equation for the combustion of 
1 mol of C8H181l2. (b) By using the information in 
this problem and data in Table 5.3, calculate ∆Hf° for 
2,3,4-trimethylpentane.
