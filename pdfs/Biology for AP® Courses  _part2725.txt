CHAPTER SUMMARY
23.1 The Plant Body
A vascular plant consists of two organ systems: the shoot system and the root system. The shoot system includes the
aboveground vegetative portions (stems and leaves) and reproductive parts (flowers and fruits). The root system supports
the plant and is usually underground. A plant is composed of two main types of tissue: meristematic tissue and permanent
tissue. Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells found in root and shoot tips. As growth occurs, meristematic
tissue differentiates into permanent
