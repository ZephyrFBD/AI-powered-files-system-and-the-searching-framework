31. (I) A novice skier, starting from rest, slides down an icy fric-
tionless 8.0° incline whose vertical height is 105 m. How
fast is she going when she reaches the bottom?
32. (I) Jane, looking for Tarzan, is running at top speed
and grabs a vine hanging vertically from a tall
tree in the jungle. How high can she swing upward? Does
the length of the vine affect your answer?
33. (II) A sled is initially given a shove up a frictionless 23.0°
incline. It reaches a maximum vertical height 1.22 m higher
than where it started at the bottom. What was its initial speed?
34. (II) In the high jump, the kinetic energy of an athlete is
transformed into gravitational potential energy without the
aid of a pole. With what minimum speed must the athlete
leave the ground in order to lift his center of mass 2.10 m
and cross the bar with a speed of 
35. (II) A spring with  
hangs vertically next to a
ruler. The end of the spring is next to the 15-cm mark on
the ruler. If a 2.5-kg mass is n
