 exchange of matter between the interior of the cell and
the environment is mediated by this membrane with
selective permeability.
A. Pose questions that identify
•
the important characteristics of this lipid bilayer
structure
•
the molecules that must be acquired from the
environment and eliminated from the cell
•
relationships between the structures of these
molecules and the structure of the bilayer
Because the plasma cell membrane has both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic properties, few types of molecules
possess structures that allow them to pass between the
interior of the cell and the environment through passive
diffusion. The fluidity of the membrane affects passive
transport, and the incorporation of other molecules in the
membrane, in particular cholesterols, has a strong effect on
its fluidity. Fluidity is also affected by temperature.
Measurements of the speed of movement of oxygen
molecules, O2, through three types of membranes were
made (Widomska et al., Biochimica et Biophys
