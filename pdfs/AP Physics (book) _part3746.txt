The Observable Universe
Figure 33–27 can easily be misinterpreted: it is not a picture of the universe at
a given instant, but is intended to suggest how we look out in all directions from
our observation point (the Earth, or near it). Be careful not to think that the birth
of the universe took place in a circle or a sphere surrounding us as if Fig. 33–27
were a photo taken at a given moment. What Fig. 33–27 does show is what we can
see, the observable universe. Better yet, it shows the most we could see.
