the E. coli bacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may also undergo infections where they are not producing
virions for long periods. An example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of herpes in
humans. In a process called latency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing
new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though there are
similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages. Latency
will be described in more detail below.
Figure 21.10 A temperate bacteriophage has both lytic and lysogenic cycles. In the lytic cycle, the phage
replicates and lyses the host cell. In the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host genome,
where it is passed on to s
