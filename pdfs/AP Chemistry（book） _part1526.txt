Make a sketch of the structure of this molecule that is anal-
ogous to Figure 9.25. In addition, answer the following 
three questions: (a) Is the molecule planar? (b) Does it have 
a nonzero dipole moment? (c) Would the bonding in al-
lene be described as delocalized? Explain.

[9.100]  Sodium azide is a shock-sensitive compound that releases N2 
upon physical impact. The compound is used in automobile 
airbags. The azide ion is N3
-. (a) Draw the Lewis structure of the 
azide ion that minimizes formal charge (it does not form a trian-
gle). Is it linear or bent? (b) State the hybridization of the central 
N atom in the azide ion. (c) How man
