the force exerted on the fluid is opposite to
the displacement. Work is also done on the fluid by the force of gravity. The net
effect of the process shown in Fig. 10–22 is to move a mass m of volume 
(
since the fluid is incompressible) from point 1 to point 2, so the work
done by gravity is
where 
and 
are heights of the center of the tube above some (arbitrary) refer-
ence level. In the case shown in Fig. 10–22, this term is negative since the motion
is uphill against the force of gravity. The net work W done on the fluid is thus
According to the work-energy principle (Section 6–3), the net work done on a
system is equal to its change in kinetic energy. Hence
The mass m has volume 
for an incompressible fluid. Thus we can
substitute
and then divide through by 
to obtain
which we rearrange to get

This is Bernoulli’s equation. Since points 1 and 2 can be any two points along a
tube of flow, Bernoulli’s equation can be written as
at every point in the fluid, where y is the heigh
