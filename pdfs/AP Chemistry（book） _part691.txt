netic energy. Heating 
your house by reacting natural gas with oxygen converts chemical energy into heat. In 
both cases—and every other one you can imagine—energy can be converted from one form 
to another, but it is neither created nor destroyed. This observation, one of the most import-
ant in all of science, is known as the first law of thermodynamics. To apply this law 
quantitatively we need to divide the universe into a finite system of interest to us, and 
define the energy of that system more precisely. We explore these concepts next.
system and surroundings
When analyzing energy changes, we need to focus on a limited and well-defined part of the 
universe to keep track of the energy changes that occur. The portion we single out for study is 
called the system; everything else is called the surroundings. When we study the energy
