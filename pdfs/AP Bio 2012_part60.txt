57. The illustration above depicts a neuromuscular junction of a patient with an autoimmune disorder. Acetylcholine 
is a stimulatory neurotransmitter. Which of the following would be the most likely result of the continued 
presence of the antibody? 
(A) An increase in action potentials in the motor neuron and constant nerve pain 
(B) A decrease in action potentials in the muscle, causing muscle weakness and fatigue 
(C) A decrease in the opening of sodium-gated channels in the muscle, causing less sodium to be released from 
the muscle 
(D) An increase in the opening of sodium-gated channels in the motor neuron because of the accumulation of 
acetylcholine in the junction
