and Measures near Paris, France, whose mass is defined as exactly 1 kg. A range
of masses is presented in Table 1–3. [For practical purposes, 1 kg weighs about
2.2 pounds on Earth.]
When dealing with atoms and molecules, we usually use the unified atomic
mass unit (u or amu). In terms of the kilogram,
The definitions of other standard units for other quantities will be given as
we encounter them in later Chapters. (Precise values of this and other useful
numbers are given inside the front cover.)
Unit Prefixes
In the metric system, the larger and smaller units are defined in multiples of 10
from the standard unit, and this makes calculation particularly easy. Thus 
1 kilometer (km) is 1000 m, 1 centimeter is 
1 millimeter (mm) is 
or 
and so on. The prefixes “centi-,” “kilo-,” and others are listed in Table 1–4 and
can be applied not only to units of length but to units of volume, mass, or any
other unit. For example, a centiliter (cL) is 
(L), and a kilogram (kg) is
1000 grams (g). An
