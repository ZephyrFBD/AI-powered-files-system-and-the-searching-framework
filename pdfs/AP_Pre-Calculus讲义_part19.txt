1.1.3 Evaluating a Function 
In the definition of a function the independent variable x plays the role of a placeholder.  
For example, the function f(x) = 3x2 + x - 5 can be thought of as   
 
To evaluate f at a number, we substitute the number for the placeholder.  
 
Example 2 
f(x) = 3x2 + x – 5. Evaluate each function value/ 
(a) f(-2) 
(b) f(0) 
(c) f(4) 
 
 
 
 
 
1.1.4 Domain of a Function 
We know that the domain of a function is the set of all inputs for the function. The domain 
of a function may be stated explicitly.  
For example, if we write 
( )
2
0
5
f x
x
x
=
£
£
 
then the domain is the set of all real numbers x for which

If the function is given by an algebraic expression and the domain is not stated explicitly, 
then by convention the domain of the function is the domain of the algebraic expression—
that is, the set of all real numbers for which the expression is de
