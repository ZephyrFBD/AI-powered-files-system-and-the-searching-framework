ross the resistor in an LR circuit like
that in Fig. 21–37 to drop to 2.5% of its original value, after
the switch is moved to the upper position, removing 
from
the circuit?
*52. (III) Determine 
at
(when the battery is con-
nected) for the LR circuit of Fig. 21–37 and show that if 
I continued to increase at this rate, it would reach its
maximum value in one time constant.
*53. (III) After how many time constants does the current in
Fig. 21–37 reach within (a) 10%, (b) 1.0%, and (c) 0.1% of
its maximum value?
*21–13 AC Circuits and Reactance
*54. (I) What is the reactance of a
capacitor at a
frequency of (a) 60.0 Hz, (b) 1.00 MHz?
*55. (I) At what frequency will a 32.0-mH inductor have a reac-
tance of 
*56. (I) At what frequency will a
capacitor have a
reactance of 
*57. (II) Calculate the reactance of, and rms current in, a 260-mH
radio coil connected to a 240-V (rms) 10.0-kHz ac line. Ignore
resistance.
