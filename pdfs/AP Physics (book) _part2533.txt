60.0 cm
in front of the mirror, on the same side as the object.
(b) From Eq. 23–3, the magnification is
The image is 3.0 times larger than the object, and its height is
The minus sign reminds us that the image is inverted, as shown in Fig. 23–16.
NOTE When an object is further from a concave mirror than the focal point, we
can see from Fig. 23–15 or 23–16 that the image is always inverted and real.
Reversible rays. If the object in Example23–4
is placed instead where the image is (see Fig. 23–16), where will the new image be?
RESPONSE The mirror equation is symmetric in 
and 
Thus the new image
will be where the old object was. Indeed, in Fig. 23–16 we need only reverse the
direction of the rays to get our new situation.
