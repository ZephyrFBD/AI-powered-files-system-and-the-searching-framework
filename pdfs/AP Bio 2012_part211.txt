y also say that the protein may 
end up embedded into the cell membrane. The student may 
not be able to elaborate on the functions. The student may 
mention that the proteins are found in transport vesicles for 
further processing in the Golgi apparatus. The student may 
mention that proteins end up inside a vacuole but may not 
mention their function. 
Free ribosome (location and function): 
The student is able to explain how a protein produced on 
the free ribosome may end up in the cytosol or a vacuole. 
The explanation may also include factors surrounding 
the location of a protein in the nucleus. The student may 
mention that the protein has something to do with DNA but 
not elaborate further.
