Question 8 
 
Figure 1. A single cell from the epithelial layer lining the intestine illustrating movement 
of glucose and Na+ from the intestinal lumen to the blood 
 
  Glucose and sodium move from the lumen of the small intestine into the blood via transport proteins in 
the epithelial cells lining the small intestine (Figure 1). Based on Figure 1, describe the direct source of 
energy used to move glucose into the epithelial cell from the intestinal lumen. Explain how this
