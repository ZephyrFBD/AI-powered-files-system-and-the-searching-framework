The following figures show two strains of the fungus Sordaria (n = 7) sexually reproducing and forming spores.
Only one chromosome (or one pair of homologous chromosomes) for each strain is shown, and that chromosome
carries a gene for spore color. Black-colored chromosomes carry the black (wild type) spore color, and the gray
chromosomes carry a tan-colored mutant spore color. In some of the figures, the spore colors are omitted.
Chromatids of the chromosome for the black strain are labeled B1 and B2, and chromatids for its homologue from
the tan strain are labeled T1 and T2.
