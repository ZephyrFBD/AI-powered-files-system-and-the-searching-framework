g is inherent in the hare population due to density-dependent effects such as
lower fecundity (maternal stress) caused by crowding when the hare population gets too dense. The hare cycling would
then induce the cycling of the lynx because it is the lynxesâ€™ major food source. The more we study communities, the more
complexities we find, allowing ecologists to derive more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics.
Herbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals, and it is another interspecific relationship that
affects populations. Unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. Some

plants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory. Other species have developed mutualistic relationships; for
example, herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that ai
