s than with either
Neanderthals or modern humans. In 2016, the same group
of scientists who sequenced the mtDNA from the femur of
one of the Sima fossils partially sequenced the DNA from
that fossil, showing a clear connection to Neanderthals.
C. Analyze these data to draw alternative conclusions
regarding the relatedness of the three fossils and support
each with evidence.
D. Design a plan to differentiate or resolve these
alternative conclusions.

Figure 15.1 Genes, which are carried on (a) chromosomes, are linearly organized instructions for making the RNA
and protein molecules that are necessary for all of processes of life. The (b) interleukin-2 protein and (c) alpha-2u-
globulin protein are just two examples of the array of different molecular structures that are encoded by genes. (credit
