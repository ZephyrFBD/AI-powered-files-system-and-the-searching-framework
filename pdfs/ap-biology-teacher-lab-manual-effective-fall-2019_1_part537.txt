their blood sugar levels is often made from engineered bacteria. Some vaccines, as 
well as enzymes used for manufacturing denim jeans, are also made using engineered 
cells. In the near future, engineered bacteria and other cells being developed could help 
clean up spilled oil or chemicals, produce fuel for cars and trucks, and even store excess 
carbon dioxide to help slow global climate change. Can you think of other possible 
applications of genetic engineering? However, biotechnology and human manipulation 
of DNA raise several ethical, social, and medical issues, such as the safety of genetically 
modified foods. Can you think of other issues to consider?

This biotechnology depends on plasmids, small circles of DNA that were found first 
in bacteria. Plasmids allow molecular biologists to manipulate genetic information in 
a laboratory setting to understand more fully how DNA operates. Pl
