Figure 35.21 The ocean is divided into different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline.
Ocean waters receive varying amounts of sunlight based on the depth. Where would you expect to find the most
photosynthesis in an ocean biome?
a.
aphotic zone
b.
abyssal zone
c.
benthic realm
d.
intertidal zone
Marine Biomes
The ocean is the largest marine biome. It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical
composition; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. Within the ocean, coral reefs are a second
kind of marine biome. Estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome.
Ocean
The physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms. The ocean is
categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. Each zo
