as long as 
sufficient quantities of solids are present. (a) CaCO3 simply de-
composes, forming CaO(s) and CO21g2 until the equilibrium pres-
sure of CO2 is attained. There must be enough CaCO3, however, to 
allow the CO2 pressure to reach equilibrium. (b) CO2 continues to 
combine with CaO until the partial pressure of the CO2 decreases 
to the equilibrium value. (c) Because there is no CaO present, 
equilibrium cannot be attained; there is no way the CO2 pressure 
can decrease to its equilibrium value (which would require some 
CO2 to react with CaO). (d) The situation is essentially the same as 
in (a): CaCO3 decomposes until equilibrium is attained. The pres-
ence of CaO initially makes no difference.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If 8.0 g of NH4HS1s2 is placed in a sealed vessel with 
a volume of 1.0 L and heated to 200 °C the reaction 
NH4HS1s2 ∆ NH31g2 + H2S1g2 will occur. When the sys-
tem comes to equilibrium, some NH4HS1s2 is still present. 
Which of the following changes will lead
