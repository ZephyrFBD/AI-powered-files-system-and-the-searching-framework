tituted the starting concentrations into the 
equilibrium-constant expression of Equation 15.23, we obtained Q c = 0.500 whereas 
Kc = 0.105. The equilibrium constant has only one value at each temperature. The reac-
tion quotient, however, varies as the reaction proceeds.
Of what use is Q? One practical thing we can do with Q is tell whether our reaction 
really is at equilibrium, which is an especially valuable option when a reaction is very slow. 
We can take samples of our reaction mixture as the reaction proceeds, separate the compo-
nents, and measure their concentrations. Then we insert these numbers into Equation 15.24 
for our reaction. To determine whether we are at equilibrium, or in which direction the 
reaction proceeds to achieve equilibrium, we compare the values of Q c and Kc or Q p and Kp. 
There are three possible scenarios (Figure 15.9), which can be summarized as follows:
