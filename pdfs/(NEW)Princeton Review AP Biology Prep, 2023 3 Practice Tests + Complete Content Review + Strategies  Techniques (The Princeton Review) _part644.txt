regulatory unit in bacteria.
12. A
The primitive atmosphere lacked oxygen (O2). It contained methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and carbon
dioxide (CO2).
13. A
Villi and microvilli are fingerlike projections present in the small intestine, which dramatically increase the
surface area available for nutrient absorption.
14. C
The pancreas produces digestive enzymes, and enzymes are sensitive to pH. The inability to neutralize
stomach acid would disrupt the function of the enzymes. Food moving too quickly would decrease
digestion/absorption rates but the function of the enzyme would be intact. Removal of water should not greatly
affect enzyme function.
15. D
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer should start with ribosome. So
eliminate (A) and (C). The polypeptide then moves through the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is
modified and packaged into a vesicle. The vesicle then floats to the plasma membrane and is secreted. C
