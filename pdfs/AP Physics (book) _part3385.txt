of the fact that
decays with a half-life of about 5730 yr. This is because energetic nuclei in the
cosmic radiation, which impinges on the Earth from outer space, strike nuclei of
atoms in the atmosphere and break those nuclei into pieces, releasing free
neutrons. Those neutrons can collide with nitrogen nuclei in the atmosphere to
produce the nuclear transformation 
That is, a neutron
strikes and is absorbed by a 
nucleus, and a proton is knocked out in the
process. The remaining nucleus is 
This continual production of 
in the
atmosphere roughly balances the loss of 
by radioactive decay.
As long as a plant or tree is alive, it continually uses the carbon from carbon
dioxide in the air to build new tissue and to replace old. Animals eat plants, so
they too are continually receiving a fresh supply of carbon for their tissues.
