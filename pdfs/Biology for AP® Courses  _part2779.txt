a.
Darkness inhibits germination.

Red light promotes germination.

Seeds were germinated in the dark on three plates. Plate A
was irradiated with a short pulse of red light; plate B was
irradiated with a short pulse of red light followed
immediately by a pulse of far-red light; plate D was
irradiated by a short pulse of red light followed one hour
later by a pulse of far-red light; and plate C was the control
and was maintained in the dark. After three days, the
plates were scored for percentage of germination, as
shown in this table. What hypothesis do the results suggest
about the mechanism of action of red light?
a.
Red light converts the phytochrome to i
