udents 
choose to explore are safe. There are several postulated or proven mutagens that 
students likely could handle safely, including the following: 
•  Dilute hydrogen peroxide 
•  Caffeine 
•  UV light source (The bacteria must be kept in the dark to prevent DNA repair, and 
students must wear UV goggles.) 
•  Potassium nitrate (used in food preservation) 
4. Can bacteria take up two different plasmids? This is an advanced investigation that 
requires two different plasmids. However, it can lead to very interesting outcomes 
because some pairs of plasmids are compatible, while others are not. 
5. Does having this plasmid give the bacteria an advantage other than antibiotic 
resistance? Mix equal amounts of transformed bacteria with untransformed bacteria, 
and plate them together on one plate. Which colonies are bigger after 24 hours? 
Which colonies are more numerous? This investigation would tie nicely into labs on 
interspecific competition or natural selection.
