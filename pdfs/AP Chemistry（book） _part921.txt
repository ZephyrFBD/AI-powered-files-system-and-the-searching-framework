 of an electron). Heisenberg’s principle is called the uncertainty principle. When 
applied to the electrons in an atom, this principle states that it is impossible for us to 
know simultaneously both the exact momentum of an electron and its exact location in 
space.
Heisenberg mathematically related the uncertainty in position, ∆x, and the 
uncertainty in momentum, ∆1mv2, to a quantity involving the Planck constant:
 
∆x # ∆1mv2 Ú
h

[6.9]
A brief calculation illustrates the dramatic implications of the uncertainty prin-
ciple. The electron has a mass of 9.11 * 10 - 31 kg and moves at an average speed of 
about 5 * 106 m>s in a hydrogen atom. Let’s assume that we know the speed to an 
uncertainty of 1% [that is, an uncertainty of 10.01215 * 106 m>s2 = 5 * 104 m>s] 
and that this is the only important source of uncertainty in the momentum, so that 
∆1mv2 = m ∆v. We can use Equation 6.9 to calculate the uncertainty in the position 
of the electron:
 
∆x Ú
