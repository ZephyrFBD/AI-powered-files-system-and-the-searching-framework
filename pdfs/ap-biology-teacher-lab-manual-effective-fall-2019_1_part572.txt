ernative is to have a team of 
students create a mock crime scenario for other teams, with you providing appropriate 
“evidence” samples of DNA.) You will have to reserve a vial of lambda DNA cut with 
HindIII to serve as a marker, providing a set of RFLPs of known sizes (standard). 
To make these evidence samples, you can use the vials of lambda DNA cut with 
EcoRI and HindIII and the “uncut” samples of lambda DNA provided in the kit. Remove 
the labels from the vials and replace them with new labels indicating the source of the 
sample, e.g., “Suspect 1,” “Suspect 2,” “Blood,” or “Ms. Mason,” “Mr. Gladson,” “Bobby,” 
“Principal.” You can purchase samples of lambda DNA cut with other restriction 
enzymes from commercial vendors, or you can combine a sample of lambda DNA cut 
with EcoRI with a sample cut with HindIII to mix things up. To be more tricky, give 
each student group DNA “evidence” that leads to different perpetrators, i.e., for one 
group, Bobby is guilty, whereas for anoth
