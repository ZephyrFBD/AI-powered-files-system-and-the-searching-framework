stem II to DCPIP. 
(C) DCMU acts as an additional source of 
electrons to the light reaction of 
photosynthesis. 
(D) DCMU acts as an inhibitor to the 
movement of electrons within the light 
reaction of photosynthesis. 
28. Which of the following best justifies the use of 
tube 2 as a control treatment? 
(A) It was a negative control for the accuracy 
of the spectrophotometer, ensuring that an 
accurate reading for treatment cuvette 2 
would be made. 
(B) It was a negative control for the chemical 
stability of the chlorophyll suspension, 
ensuring that changes in absorbance 
could only be attributed to changes in 
chlorophyll content. 
(C) It was a positive control for the change in 
DCPIP color associated with changes in 
light intensity. 
(D) It was a positive control for measuring the 
effect of DCMU on the reaction.
