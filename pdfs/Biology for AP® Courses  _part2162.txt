1.A
Change in the genetic makeup of a population over time is evolution.
Essential
Knowledge
1.A.1 Natural selection is a major mechanism of evolution.
Science Practice
2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural
phenomena.
Science Practice
5.3 The student can evaluate the evidence provided by data sets in relation to a particular
scientific question.
Learning
Objective
1.2 The student is able to evaluate evidence provided by data to qualitatively and
quantitatively investigate the role of natural selection in evolution.
Essential
Knowledge
1.A.2 Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations.
Science Practice
7.1 The student can connect phenomena and models across spatial and temporal scales.
Learning
Objective
1.5 The student is able to connect evolutionary changes in a population over time to a
change in the environment.
Natural selection only acts on the populationâ€™s heritable trait
