s complete mass). Biological macromolecules
are organic, meaning they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor
elements.
Most macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called monomers. The monomers combine with
each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water

molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while
losing water.”
Figure 3.2 In the dehydration synthesis reaction depicted above, two molecules of glucose are linked together to form
the disaccharide maltose. In the process, a water molecule is formed.
In a dehydration synthesis reaction (Figure 3.2), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of
another monomer, releasing a molecule of wat
