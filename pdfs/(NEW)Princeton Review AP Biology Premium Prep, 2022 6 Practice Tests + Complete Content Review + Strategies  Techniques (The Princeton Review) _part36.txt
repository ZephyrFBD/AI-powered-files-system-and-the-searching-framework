Question 37–40 refer to the following passage.
The enzymatic catalysis of a reaction essential in the production of dog saliva is mediated by the protein
ARKKKK60491. ARKKKK60491 is a homodimer, with each subunit being 337 amino acids. Figure 1, below,
indicates a modular structure of the homodimer. Three positions are indicated on the model. Position A is the active
site. Position B is a region known to have a large number of nonpolar residues. Position C is known to have a large
number of charged residues.

37. A mutation is discovered in the gene for ARKKKK60491 that converts positively charged lysine residue into
negatively charged glutamic acid re
