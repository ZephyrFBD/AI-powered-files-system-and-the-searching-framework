CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations
Chemists frequently need to calculate the amounts of reactants and products present at 
equilibrium in a reaction for which they know the equilibrium constant. The approach 
in solving problems of this type is similar to the one we used for evaluat
