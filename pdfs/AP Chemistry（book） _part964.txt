A major challenge facing medical diagnosis is seeing inside the hu-
man body. Until recently, this was accomplished primarily by X-ray 
technology. X rays do not, however, give well-resolved images of 
overlapping physiological structures, and sometimes fail to discern 
diseased or injured tissue. Moreover, because X rays are high-energy 
radiation, they potentially can cause physiological harm, even in low 
doses. An imaging technique developed in the 1980s called magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) does not have these disadvantages.
The foundation of MRI is a phenomenon called nuclear  
magnetic 
resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the mid-1940s. Today NMR 
has become one of the most important spectroscopic methods used 
in chemistry. NMR is based on the observation that, like electrons, 
the nu
