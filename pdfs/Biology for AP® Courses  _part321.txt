te is replaced by a valine.
Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave,
or disc-shaped, red blood cells and cause them to assume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs blood vessels (Figure
3.29). This can lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for

Secondary Structure
The local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein. The most common
are the α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures (Figure 3.30). Bo
