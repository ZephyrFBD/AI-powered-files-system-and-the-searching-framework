pounds. These types of chemical reactions have been used for thousands 
of years in the baking of breads as well as in the production of alcoholic 
beverages like beer and wine. Chemical reactions that produce CO2 are 
not limited to cooking, though—they occur in places as diverse as the 
cells in your body and the engine of your car.
In this chapter we begin exploring chemical reactions. Our focus 
will be on the use of chemical formulas to represent reactions and on 
the quantitative information we can obtain about the amounts of sub-
stances involved in those reactions. Stoichiometry (pronounced 
stoy-key-OM-uh-tree) is the area of study that examines the quantities 
of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions. Stoichi-
ometry (Greek stoicheion, “element,” and metron, “measure”) provides an 
essential set of tools widely used in chemistry.

Stoichiometry is built on an understanding of atomic masses  
 (Section 2.4), chemi-
cal formulas, and the law of conservation
