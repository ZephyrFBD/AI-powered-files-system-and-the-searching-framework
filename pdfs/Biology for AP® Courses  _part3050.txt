tral nervous system
include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglial cells. Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath
around axons. Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain their extracellular environment, and provide structural
support. Microglia scavenge pathogens and dead cells. Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the
neurons. Glial cells of the (b) peripheral nervous system include Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath, and
satellite cells, which provide nutrients and structural support to neurons.
