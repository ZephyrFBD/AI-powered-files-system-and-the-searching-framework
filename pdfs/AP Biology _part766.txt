ically identical to
the parent. It has several advantages over sexual reproduction:
It enables animals that are living in isolation to reproduce without a
mate.
It can create numerous offspring quickly.
It does not require as much energy as sexual reproduction does,
since sexual reproduction involves reproductive systems and
hormonal cycles.
Because offspring are clones of the parent (meaning the offspring
are genetically identical to the parent), it is advantageous when the
environment is stable.
Reproduction occurs by mitotic cell division.
The following list shows the types of asexual reproduction in sample
organisms:
Budding involves the splitting off of new individuals from existing
ones. (An example is hydra.)
Fragmentation and regeneration occur when a single parent
breaks into parts that regenerate into new individuals. (Examples
are sponges, planaria, and starfish.)
Parthenogenesis involves the development of an egg without
fertilization. The resulting adult is haploid. (Examp
