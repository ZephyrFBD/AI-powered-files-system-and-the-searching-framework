REAL ZEROS OF POLYNOMIALS 
If P is a polynomial and c is a real number, then the following are equivalent: 
1. c is a zero of P. 
2. x = c is a solution of the equation P(x) = 0. 
3. x − c is a factor of P(x). 
4. c is an x-intercept of the graph of P. 
For example, to find the zeros of P(x) = x2 +x -6, we factor P to get P(x) = (x-2)(x+3). 
From this factored form we easily see that 
1. 2 is a zero of P. 
2. x = 2 is a solution of the equation. 
3. x − 2 is a factor of the equation.

4. 2 is an x-intercept of the graph of P.  
The same facts are true for the other zero, −3. 
 
INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM FOR POLYNOMIALS 
If P is a polynomial function and P(a) and P(b) have opposite signs, then there exists at 
least one value c between a and b for which P(c) = 0.
