 a glycerol molecule.
 13.28  Oil and water are immiscible. Which is the most likely 
reason? (a) Oil molecules are denser than water. (b) Oil 
molecules are composed mostly of carbon and hydrogen. 
 
(c) Oil molecules have higher molar masses than water. 
 
(d) Oil molecules have higher vapor pressures than water. 
(e) Oil molecules have higher boiling points than water.
 13.29  Common laboratory solvents include acetone 1CH3COCH32, 
methanol 1CH3OH2, toluene 1C6H5CH32, and water. Which 
of these is the best solvent for nonpolar solutes?
 13.30  Would you expect alanine (an amino acid) to be more solu-
ble in water or in hexane?
(b) The higher the temperature, the more soluble most 
ionic solids are in water.
(c) As you cool a saturated solution from high temperature 
to low temperature, solids start to crystallize out of solu-
tion if you achieve a supersaturated solution.
(d)  If you take a saturated solution and raise its tempera-
ture, you can (usually) add more solute and make th
