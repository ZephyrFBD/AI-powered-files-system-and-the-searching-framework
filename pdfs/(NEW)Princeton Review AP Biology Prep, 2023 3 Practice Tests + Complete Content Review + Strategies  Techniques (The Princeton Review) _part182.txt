dy detailed structures of a cell that cannot be easily seen or observed by light
microscopy. They are capable of resolving structures as small as a few nanometers in length,
such as individual virus particles or the pores on the surface of the nucleus.
A prokaryotic cell, which is a lot smaller than a eukaryotic cell, is relatively simple. Bacteria and archaea are
examples of prokaryotes. The inside of the cell is filled with a substance called cytoplasm. The genetic material in a
prokaryote is one continuous, circular DNA molecule that is found free in the cell in an area called the nucleoid
(this is not the same as a nucleus!). Most prokaryotes have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycans that surrounds a
lipid layer called the plasma membrane. Prokaryotes also have ribosomes (though smaller than those found in
eukaryotic cells). Some bacteria may also have one or more flagella, which are long projections used for motility
(movement) and they might have a thick capsule outside their c
