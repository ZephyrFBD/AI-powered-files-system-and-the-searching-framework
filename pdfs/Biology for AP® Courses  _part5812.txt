 here is ‘except’:
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right EXCEPT
such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests
of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention
of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
and freedoms of others [My emphasis].
No interference except in accordance with the law means there are no
‘human rights’ except what EU governments decide you can have at
their behest. ‘As is necessary in a democratic society’ explains that
reference in the judgement and ‘in the interests of national security,
public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the
prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or
morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’
gives the EU a coach and horses to ride through ‘human rights’ and
scaĴer them in all d
