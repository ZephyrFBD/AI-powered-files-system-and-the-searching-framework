 or by learning these behaviors from
other birds.
4. (C) Homologous structures indicate common ancestry but may have different functions. Whales, horses, and
humans are all mammals and share common ancestry, but their limbs have different functions. Analogous
structures have similar functions. However, whale limbs are used for swimming, horse limbs are used for
trotting or running, and human limbs are used for reaching and grasping; they do not have similar functions, so
choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because convergent evolution results in analogous structures and
does not indicate common ancestry. Vestigial structures are structures in an organism that have no current
function but may have had a function in an ancestral species, so choice (D) is incorrect.
5. (B) Increased use of products that contain triclosan will create an environment in which triclosan-resistant
bacteria have a survival advantage, so over time the relative numbers of triclosan-resistant bacteria
