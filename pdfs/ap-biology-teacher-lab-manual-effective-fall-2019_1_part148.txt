 this lab manual. The 
skills labeled on the bottom of the pyramid are generally less complex, and require 
the application of standard procedures. As you move up the pyramid, the applications 
become more complex as you try to make sense out of data and biological phenomena. 
One of the important lessons about quantitative reasoning is that real data are 
“messy.” The increasing complexity as you move up this pyramid does not necessarily 
indicate that the mathematical operations themselves are more complex. Good, first 
approximations of mathematical models often require only simple arithmetic. This 
chapter describes how the quantitative skills listed in the pyramid are applied when 
answering questions generated by various lab topics in this manual. 
■Counting, Measuring, and Calculating
At this point in your education, you may not feel that counting, measuring, and
calculating represent much in the way of a “skill.” And you’d be right in a theoretical
world. The problem is that yo
