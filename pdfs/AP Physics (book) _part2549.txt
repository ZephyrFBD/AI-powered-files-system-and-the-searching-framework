looks bent even when it isn’t.
SNELL’S LAW 
(LAW OF REFRACTION)
Apparent depth of a pool. A swimmer has dropped her
goggles to the bottom of a pool at the shallow end, marked as 1.0 m deep. But
the goggles don’t look that deep. Why? How deep do the goggles appear to be
when you look straight down into the water?
APPROACH We draw a ray diagram showing two rays going upward from a point
on the goggles at a small angle, and being refracted at the water’s (flat) surface,
Fig. 23–25. The two rays traveling upward from the goggles are refracted away
from the normal as they exit the water, and so appear to be diverging from a
point above the goggles (dashed lines), which is why the water seems less deep
than it actually is. We are looking straight down, so all angles are small (but exag-
gerated in Fig. 23–25 for clarity).
SOLUTION To calculate the apparent depth 
(Fig. 23–25), given a real depth
we use Snell’s law wit
