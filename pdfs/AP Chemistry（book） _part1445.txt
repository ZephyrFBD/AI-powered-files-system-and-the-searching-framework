1s2 MO, and their spins are paired. Electrons occupying a bonding molecular orbital 
are called bonding electrons. Because the s
1s MO is lower in energy than the H 1s atomic 
orbitals, the H2 molecule is more stable than the two separate H atoms.
By analogy with atomic electron configurations, the electron configurations for 
molecules can be written with superscripts to indicate electron occupancy. The electron 
configuration for H2, then, is s1s
