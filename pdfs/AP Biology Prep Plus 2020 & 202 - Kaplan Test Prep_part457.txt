.). There are a
few organisms that exist in a natural state with haploid or
polyploid cells, but most organisms are diploid.
Meiosis occurs in two steps, meiosis I and meiosis II. Each step includes a
round of division and is divided into four phases. Meiosis II is essentially
mitosis with half the number of chromosomes, but meiosis I contains
some key diﬀerences from both meiosis II and mitosis.
MEIOSIS I
The four phases of meiosis I are described below.
Prophase I
The chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the spindle apparatus
forms, and the nucleoli and nuclear membrane disappear. Homologous
chromosomes (chromosomes that code for the same traits, one inherited
from each parent) come together and intertwine in a process called
synapsis. Because at this stage each chromosome consists of two sister
chromatids, each synaptic pair of homologous chromosomes contains
four chromatids and is therefore oȇen called a tetrad.
Sometimes chromatids of homologous chromosomes break at
corresponding
