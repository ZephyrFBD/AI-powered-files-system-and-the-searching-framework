(e) In the structure on the left, there are 3 equatorial and 1 axial ﬂuo-
rine atoms. In the structure on the right, there are 2 equatorial and 
2 axial ﬂuorine atoms. 9.118 ∆H from bond enthalpies is 5364 kJ; 
∆H from ∆H°
f values is 5535 kJ. The difference in the two results, 
171 kJ  >  mol C6H6, is due to the resonance stabilization in benzene. 
Because the p electrons are delocalized, the molecule has a lower 
overall energy than that predicted using bond enthalpies for localized 
C ¬ C and C “C bonds. Thus, the amount of energy actually required 
to decompose 1 mole of C6H6(g), represented by the Hess’ law calcula-
tion, is greater than the sum of the localized bond enthalpies.
