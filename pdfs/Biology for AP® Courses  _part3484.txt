The bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and
within the medullary cavity being removed. Compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original,

Decalcification of Bones
Question: What effect does the removal of calcium and collagen have on bone structure?
Background: Conduct a literature search on the role of calcium and collagen in maintaining bone structure.
Conduct a literature search on diseases in which bone structure is compromised.
Hypothesis: Develop a hypothesis that states predictions of the flexibility, strength, and mass of bones that
have had the calcium and collagen components removed. Develop a hypothesis reg
