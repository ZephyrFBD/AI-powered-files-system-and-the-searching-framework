 into, and vice versa. If a solution produced an indicator color,
the semipermeable membrane allowed the passage of molecules that
the dye is an indicator for.
The second key skill deals with using a standard to figure out the
“identity” of an unknown and using observed data to interpolate
expected data. Part two of the experiment begins with a dialysis bag full
of solution (the concentration of which is unknown). Questions to ask
during the experiment include: What is the osmolarity/water potential of
the unknown, and how do you measure it? The first parts of the
investigation teach you to observe the eﬀects of osmosis by measuring
the change in weight. Samples are weighed and placed into solutions
with known concentrations, usually ranging from distilled water to a high
