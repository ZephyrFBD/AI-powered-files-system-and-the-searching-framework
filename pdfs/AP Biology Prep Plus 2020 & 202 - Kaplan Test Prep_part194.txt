e system produces antibodies that help fight oﬀ viral
antigens. Vaccines for influenza work by stimulating the body to
produce the antibodies that recognize the antigens of the virus.
Which of the following is the most plausible explanation of why
previously inoculated people have to receive the influenza vaccine
annually?
The influenza virus will likely undergo minor mutations in the
genes that encode the influenza antigens.
(A)
The influenza virus will likely undergo major mutations that
are caused by genetic recombination resulting from two
diﬀerent influenza strains infecting a host cell at the same
time.
(B)
Natural selection causes only the most successful viruses
from the previous year to survive to the current year.
(C)
Crossing over of the viruses’ chromosomes recombines
genes, creating the variation required for new strains to
emerge.
(D)
4. Most bacteria cells contain plasmids. However, these plasmids
can be lost during cellular division. Which statement best
describes the r
