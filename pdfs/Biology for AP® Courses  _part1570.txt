ogy and physiology.
b.
Two strains of Vibrio cholerae were used for the
experiment. Griffith injected a mouse with heat-
inactivated S strain (pathogenic) and R strain
(non-pathogenic). The mouse died and S strain
was recovered from the dead mouse. He
concluded that external DNA is taken up by a
cell that changed morphology and physiology.
c.
Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used for the
experiment. Griffith injected a mouse with heat-
inactivated S strain (pathogenic) and R strain
(non-pathogenic). The mouse died and R strain
was recovered from the dead mouse. He
concluded that external DNA is taken up by a
cell that changed morphology and physiology.
d.
Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used for the
experiment. Griffith injected a mouse with heat-
inactivated S strain (pathogenic) and R strain
(non-pathogenic). The mouse died and S strain
was recovered from the dead mouse. He
concluded that mutation occurred in the DNA of
the cell that changed morphology and
physiology.
