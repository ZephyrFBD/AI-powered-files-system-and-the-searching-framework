the lungs.
27. If a patient has increased resistance in his or her lungs,
how can this be detected by a doctor? What does this
mean?
a.
This can be detected using a nebulizer. By
detecting the rate at which air can be taken into
the lung, a diagnosis of a restrictive disease can
be made.
b.
This can be detected using spirometry. By
detecting the rate at which air can be taken into
the lung, a diagnosis of a restrictive disease can
be made.
c.
This can be detected using a nebulizer. By
detecting the rate at which air can be expelled
from the lung, a diagnosis of a restrictive disease
can be made.
d.
This can be detected using spirometry. By
detecting the rate at which air can be expelled
from the lung, a diagnosis of a restrictive disease
can be made.
28. When someone is standing, gravity stretches the
bottom of the lung down toward the floor to a greater
extent than the top of the lung. What implication could this
have on ventilation in the lungs?
a.
Concentration gradient leads to inc
