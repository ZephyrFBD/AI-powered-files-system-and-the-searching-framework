ure 23.18). A layer
of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root. The endodermis
is exclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the root’s vascular system. A waxy substance called
suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells. This waxy region, known as the Casparian strip, forces water and
solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells. This ensures that only
materials required by the root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded.
The outermost cell layer of the root’s vascular tissue is the pericycle, an area that can give rise to lateral roots. In dicot roots,
the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an X shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is
arranged in a ring around the pith.
