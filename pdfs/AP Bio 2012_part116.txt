ntroduces genetic variation in the viral population.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the virus particle does not get damaged 
during the infection stage. Although the viral envelope fuses with the host cell 
membrane, the virus particle is not damaged during the process of infection.
(B)
This option is correct. The process of reverse transcription does not  
involve proofreading.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The host cell provides the nucleotides for making 
viral nucleic acids, as well as enzymes, ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, ATP, 
polymerases, and other components needed for synthesizing viral proteins.  
Thus, using host machinery, viral DNA is translated effectively. 
(D)
This option is incorrect. Retroviral genes are incorporated into the host cell’s DNA 
and are transcribed into RNA molecules, which serve as genomes for the next 
viral generation and as mRNAs for translation into viral protein. The integrated 
viral DNA remains part of the host’s genome.
