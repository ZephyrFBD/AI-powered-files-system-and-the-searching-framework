For an ideal refrigerator (not a perfect one, which is impossible), the best we could
do would be
(15;6c)
analagous to an ideal (Carnot) engine (Eq. 15–5).
An air conditioner works very much like a refrigerator, although the actual
construction details are different: an air conditioner takes heat 
from inside a
room or building at a low temperature, and deposits heat 
outside to the envi-
ronment at a higher temperature. Equations 15–6 also describe the coefficient of
performance for an air conditioner.
