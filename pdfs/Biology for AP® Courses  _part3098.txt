ed the amygdala (Greek for “almond”),
illustrated in Figure 26.24. The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.
The cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain.
Cerebellum
The cerebellum (Latin for “little brain”), shown in Figure 26.21, sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The
cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks.
Brainstem
The brainstem, illustrated in Figure 26.21, connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord. It consists of the midbrain,
medulla oblongata, and the pons. Motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals
between the brain and spinal cord. Ascending neural pathways cross in this section of the brain allowing the left hemisphere
of the cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa. The brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent
from the brain to the body. The brainstem contro
