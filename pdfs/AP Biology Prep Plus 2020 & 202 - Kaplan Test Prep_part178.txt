Answers and Explanations
TEST WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
1. D
Learning Objective: 5.1
All prokaryotes lack a true nucleus, while all eukaryotes contain one,
so the cell isolated by the biologists must be a prokaryote. Therefore,
(D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because eukaryotes possess a true
nucleus, but the isolated cell did not. In addition, some prokaryotes
are quite large, so size does not immediately reveal the identity of a
cell. (B) is incorrect because the lack of a nucleus is enough to
conclude that the cell is prokaryotic. (C) is incorrect because viruses
are not, properly speaking, organisms and because viruses lack their
own ribosomes, instead using those of the host cells that they occupy.
