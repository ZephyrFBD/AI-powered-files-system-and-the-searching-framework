us atoms, these two 
forms of phosphorus differ greatly in reactivity. The white 
allotrope, which reacts violently with oxygen, must be stored 
under water so that it is not exposed to air. The much less 
reactive red form does not need to be stored this way.
The phosphorus halides react readily with water, and most fume in air because of 
reaction with water vapor. In the presence of excess water, the products are the corre-
sponding phosphorus oxyacid and hydrogen halide:
 
PBr31l2 + 3 H2O1l2 ¡ H3PO31aq2 + 3 HBr1aq2 
[22.46]
 
PCl51l2 + 4 H2O1l2 ¡ H3PO41aq2 + 5 HCl1aq2 
[22.47]
Give It Some Thought
