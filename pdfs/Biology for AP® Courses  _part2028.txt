ion can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and
postzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces
sexually. Therefore, a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; this includes barriers
that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction. A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation; this
includes organisms that donâ€™t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile.
Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the
year, often just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, called temporal isolation, can act as a form of reproductive
isolation. For example, two species of frogs inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March, whereas the
other reproduces from March to May (Figure 18.19).
