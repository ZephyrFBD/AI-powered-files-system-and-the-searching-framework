eproduction and survival are favored by natural selection.
1.
Innate behaviors are inherited and instinctive, whereas learned
behaviors are acquired through interactions with the
environment. The behaviors are not mutually exclusive.
2.
Cooperation involves organisms working together for mutual
benefits, while competition involves organisms contending
with each other for limited resources.
3.
Both environmental changes (such as deforestation and
earthquakes) and invasive species (nonnative species
introduced into an ecosystem) disrupt the balance of an
ecosystem and aï¬€ect the behavior of native populations.
4.
Communication among organisms involves the transmission of
signals to produce changes in behavior that are vital to
reproductive success, natural selection, and evolution.
