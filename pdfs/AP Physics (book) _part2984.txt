ls from Earth to the vicinity of this star at
steady speed, arriving in 3.50 years as measured by clocks
on the spaceship. (a) How long does the trip take as
measured by clocks in Earthâ€™s reference frame? (b) What
distance does the spaceship travel as measured in its own
reference frame?
77. An electron is accelerated so that its kinetic energy is
greater than its rest energy 
by a factor of (a) 5.00,
(b) 999. What is the speed of the electron in each case?
78. You are traveling in a spaceship at a speed of 0.70c away
from Earth. You send a laser beam toward the Earth
traveling at velocity c relative to you. What do observers
on the Earth measure for the speed of the laser beam?
79. A farm boy studying physics believes that he can fit a
13.0-m-long pole into a 10.0-m-long barn if he runs fast
enough, carrying the pole. Can he do it? Explain in detail.
How does this fit with the idea that when he is running the
barn looks even shorter than 10.0 m?
80. An atomic clock is taken to the Nor
