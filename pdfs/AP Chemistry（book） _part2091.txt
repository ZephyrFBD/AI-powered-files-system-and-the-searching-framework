ic pressure, Π, of the solution. 
If an external pressure equal to the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution, the liquid 
levels in the two arms can be equalized, as shown in the right panel of Figure 13.22.
The osmotic pressure obeys a law similar in form to the ideal-gas law, ΠV = inRT
where Π is the osmotic pressure, V is the volume of the solution, i is the van’t Hoff factor, 
n is the number of moles of solute, R is the ideal-gas constant, and T is the absolute tem-
perature. From this equation, we can write
 
Π = ia n
V bRT = iMRT 
[13.14]
where M is the molarity of the solution. Because the osmotic pressure for any solution 
depends on the solution concentration, osmotic pressure is a colligative property.
If two solutions of identical osmotic pressure are separated by a semipermeable mem-
brane, no osmosis will occur. The two solutions are isotonic with respect to each other. If one 
solution is of lower osmotic pressure, it is hypotonic with respect to the more concentra
