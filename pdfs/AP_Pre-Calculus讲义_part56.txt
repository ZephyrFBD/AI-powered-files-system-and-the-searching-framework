(a) Express the distance s between the lighthouse and the ship as a function of d, the 
distance the ship has traveled since noon; that is, find f so that s = f (d). 
(b) Express d as a function of t, the time elapsed since noon; that is, find g so that d = g(t). 
(c) Find f(g)What does the function represent?

2.5.1 One-to-One Functions 
Let’s compare the functions f and g whose arrow diagrams are shown below. 
 
A function with domain A is called a one-to-one function if no two elements of A have the 
same image, that is,

An equivalent way of writing the condition for a one-to-one function is this: 
If f (x1) = f (x2), then x1 = x2. 
If a horizontal line intersects the graph of f at more than one point, then we see from the 
figure that there are numbers x1 ≠ x2 such that f (x1) = f (x2).
