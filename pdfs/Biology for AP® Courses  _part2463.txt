Figure 22.16 Bacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative. Both groups have
a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan: in Gram-positive bacteria, the wall is thick, whereas in Gram-negative
bacteria, the wall is thin. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is surrounded by an outer membrane that
contains lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Porins are proteins in this cell membrane that allow substances to
pass through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, lipoteichoic acid anchors
the cell wall to the cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by "Franciscosp2"/Wikimedia Commons)
