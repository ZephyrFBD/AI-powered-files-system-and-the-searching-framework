ly present evidence 
supporting the affirmative 
and negative arguments of 
a proposition or issue.
Students can debate which 
line of evidence provides the 
strongest support for evolution. 
Error Analysis
Students analyze an 
existing solution to 
determine whether 
(or where) errors 
have occurred.
Allows students to 
troubleshoot errors and 
focus on solutions that may 
arise when they perform 
the same procedures 
themselves.
Have students analyze their 
work to determine where there 
were errors in their calculations. 
For example, this can be done 
as part of the diffusion and 
osmosis lab, or when teaching 
chi-square or the Hardy-
Weinberg principle.
