41. The following is a food web for a meadow habitat that
occupies 25.6 km2. The primary producers’ biomass is
uniformly distributed throughout the habitat and totals
1,500 kg/km2. Developers have approved a project that
will permanently reduce the primary producers’ biomass
by 50 percent and remove all rabbits and deer. Which of
the following is the most likely result at the completion of
the project?
