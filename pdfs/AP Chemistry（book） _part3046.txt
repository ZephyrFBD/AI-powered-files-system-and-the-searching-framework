ur society, we drive the 
entropy of the universe higher, as the second law says we must.
We humans are, in effect, using up our storehouse of energy- 
rich materials to create order and advance technology. As noted in 
Chapter 5, we must learn to harness new energy sources, such as solar 
energy and thereby reduce our dependence on nonrenewable sources.

At the boiling point of the liquid, another abrupt increase in entropy occurs. We can 
understand this increase as resulting from the increased volume available to the atoms or mol-
ecules as they enter the gaseous state. When the gas is heated further, the entropy increases 
steadily as more energy is stored in the translational motion of the gas atoms or molecules.
