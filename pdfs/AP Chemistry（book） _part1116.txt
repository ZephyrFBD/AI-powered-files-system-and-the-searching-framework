urations and the properties of metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.
Metals
Most metallic elements exhibit the shiny luster we associate with metals (Figure 7.14). 
Metals conduct heat and electricity. In general, they are malleable (can be pounded into 
thin sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). All are solids at room temperature 
except mercury 1melting point = -39 째C2, which is a liquid at room temperature. Two 
metals melt at slightly above room temperature, cesium at 28.4 째C and gallium at 29.8 째C. 
At the other extreme, many metals melt at very high temperatures. For example, tung-
sten, which is used for the filaments of incandescent light bulbs, melts at 3400 째C.
Metals tend to have low ionization energies (Figure 7.10) and therefore tend to form cat-
ions relatively easily. As a result, metals are oxidized (lose electrons) when they undergo 
chemical reactions. Among the fundamental atomic properties (radius, electron config-
uration, electron affinity, and so forth), fi
