through which an organism develops from an embryo to an adult is
called ontogeny.
Taxonomy
Organisms are classified into smaller and smaller subgroups based on
similar and dissimilar characteristics. This hierarchy is an implicit
illustration of the tree of life, leading to common ancestry by linkage to a
superseding group. For example, a plant in the family Euphorbiaceae is
more closely related to other plants in Euphorbiaceae than it is to plants
in the family Cactaceae. The housefly, Musca domestica, is more closely
related to other flies in the genus Musca than it is to flies in the genus
Stomoxys.
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms are illustrations that can be used to
represent the relationships between similar and dissimilar organisms.
They are constructed using morphological, molecular, or DNA evidence.
For example, in the simplified cladogram that follows, you can see that
Mollusca and Arthropoda are the most closely related phyla, as they
