ate supply of oxytocin, which causes
the contraction of smooth muscles of the uterus,
leading to the birth of the baby.
b.
The posterior pituitary continuously produces
oxytocin, which is sufficient for muscular
contraction in the uterus, thereby causing the
birth of the baby.
c.
A feedback relay occurs between the uterus,
hypothalamus, and posterior pituitary to assure
an adequate supply of prolactin, which causes
the contraction of the smooth muscles of the
uterus, leading to the birth of the baby.
d.
A feedback relay occurs between the uterus,
hypothalamus, and posterior pituitary to assure
an adequate supply of progesterone, which
causes the contraction of the smooth muscles of
the uterus, leading to the birth of the baby.
83. During childbirth, the hormone oxytocin causes
contraction of the uterine wall muscles. As muscular
contractions increase, more oxytocin is released from the
pituitary, leading to more contractions. This is an example
of which mechanism?
