Cytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and
it is normally found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion. This protein has a heme prosthetic group,
and the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced and oxidized during electron transfer. Because this
essential protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years.
Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence
homology among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the
similarities or differences among various species’ DNA or protein sequences.
Scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome c
molecule fro
