proteins that connect the pre-and postsynaptic membranes. Synapses are not static structures and can be strengthened and
weakened. Two mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation and long-term depression.
26.3 The Central Nervous System
The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three
meninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. In mammals, these include the cortex (which
can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus,
hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstemâ€”although structures in some of these designations overlap.
While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep,
involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the inf
