l the possible traits your class identified. 
Calculate appropriate descriptive statistics for the class data for the first generation: 
mean, median, range, standard deviation, etc. Create a histogram that shows the 
frequency distribution of the trait that you have selected. You can find help for this in 
Chapter 3. 
Step 6 You are now ready to make selection decisions. Directional selection tends to 
move the variability of a trait in one direction or the other (increase or decrease the 
trait in the next population). As a class, pick a trait you want to try to affect. Find the 
top (or bottom) 10% of plants with that trait in the entire classâ€™s population (e.g., out of 
a population of 150 plants, the 15 hairiest plants), and mark any that are in your plant 
bottle container. Using scissors, cut off the tops of the remaining plants in your container 
(those not in the top 10%). 
Step 7 Just as you did in Step 5, construct a new histogram and calculate descriptive 
statistics for th
