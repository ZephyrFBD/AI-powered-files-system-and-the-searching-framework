receptor of the electron transport chain.
i.
The Krebs Cycle (citric acid cycle) takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria.
ii. The electron transport chain takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.
iii. Chemiosmosis takes place across the inner membrane of the mitochondria.
iv. The following figure shows the location of fermentation and the steps of cellular respiration in the
mitochondrion:
3. Anaerobic fermentation has one additional step following glycolysis that regenerates the oxidizing
agent, NAD+, to allow glycolysis to operate in the absence of O2.
4. Both fermentation and cellular respiration are catabolic and involve oxidation-reduction reactions:
i.
Loss of electrons is oxidation (glucose to carbon dioxide).
ii. Gain of electrons is reduction (oxygen to water).
iii. Electrons = Energy.
Anaerobic fermentation produces much less energy than aerobic respiration: only 2 ATP per glucose processed, as compared to
36 ATP produced by aerobic respiration per glucose
