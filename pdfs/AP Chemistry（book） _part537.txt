uantity is usually called the solvent, and the other 
substances are called solutes; they are said to be dissolved in the solvent. When a small 
amount of sodium chloride (NaCl) is dissolved in a large quantity of water, for example, 
water is the solvent and sodium chloride is the solute.
electrolytes and Nonelectrolytes
At a young age we learn not to bring electrical devices into the bathtub so as not to elec-
trocute ourselves. That is a useful lesson because most of the water we encounter in daily 
life is electrically conducting. Pure water, however, is a very poor conductor of electricity. 
The conductivity of bathwater originates from the substances dissolved in the water, not 
from the water itself.
Not all substances that dissolve in water make the resulting solution conducting. 
Figure 4.2 shows a simple experiment to test the electrical conductivity of three solu-
tions: pure water, a solution of table sugar (sucrose) in water, and a solution of table salt 
(NaCl) in water.
