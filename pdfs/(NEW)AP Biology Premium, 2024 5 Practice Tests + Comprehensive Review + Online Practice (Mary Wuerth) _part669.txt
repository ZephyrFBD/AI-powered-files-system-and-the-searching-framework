uclei. So choice (C) is
incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because prophase involves the condensation of the genetic material into
visible chromosomes and the dissolution of the nuclear membrane.
30. (A) The first step in cell signaling is the binding of the ligand to the receptor. So if an antibody irreversibly
bound to a receptor, the cell signaling process could not start. Choice (B) would affect the secondary messenger
cyclic AMP (cAMP) because adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the formation of cAMP from ATP. Choices (C) and
(D) are incorrect because protein kinases and protein phosphatases are involved in the transduction of the signal,
which occurs after the binding of the ligand to the receptor.
31. (A) In this problem, it is stated that the population is NOT in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, nor is this
population under the conditions necessary for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. So the Hardy-Weinberg equations
cannot be used. To find the frequency of the nontaster allele, total up how many
