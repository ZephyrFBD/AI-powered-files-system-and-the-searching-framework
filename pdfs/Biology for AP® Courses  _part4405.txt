Connection for AP® Courses
Topics explored in this section that are in scope for AP® include mimicry, the competitive exclusion principle, symbiosis,
keystone and foundation species, and primary and secondary succession. Species interact in many ways, the classical
example of species interaction being the hunting of prey by its predator. In most cases, populations of predators and prey
vary in cycles. Beyond predation, because resources are often limited in an environment, multiple species may compete to
obtain them. Communities are complex entities defined by the types and number of species and the dynamics of how they
change over time. Like populations, communities change in structure and composition, often by environmental disturbances
such as fire or hurricanes.
