y is the energy that is available to the organisms at the next
trophic level. Researchers investigated the average amount of energy at
varying trophic levels in five diﬀerent ecosystems. The results are shown
in Table 1. The rows represent ecosystems, and the columns represent
trophic levels.

Identify which ecosystem has the highest gross primary productivity.
Describe one factor that contributes to high gross primary
(a)
productivity.
Based on the amount of energy at the trophic levels in the data table,
construct a food chain in the template. Write the letter of the trophic
level in the appropriate box and draw arrows to indicate the energy
flow between levels. Provide two reasons for your answer.
