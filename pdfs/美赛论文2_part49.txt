 vaccine and drug, including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc. WMA 
will build new Ebola treatment centers in these countries and formulate a reasonable 
plan of medication distribution to have the epidemic under control. What’s more, the 
situation of Ebola in all epidemic areas will be closely monitored by WMA to ensure 
the epidemic would not break out in large scale again. 
 
In particular, what we would like to remind everyone are as follows:  
 Do not contact with people who are sick or dead due to EVD.  
 Do not touch or eat the meat of primates or bats because EVD can 
spread through them too. 
 Keep your hands clean with soap and water and wash more often. 
 If you get sick and have symptoms like fever and vomit, call the 
treatment center tell them about your symptoms and obey the 
arrangement of it.

treatment, and 95 percent of victims safely buried half year later. We are confident of
