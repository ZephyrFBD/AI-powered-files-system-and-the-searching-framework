Phospholipids
Phospholipids are modified lipids. They consist of only two fatty acids
attached to the glycerol backbone, forming two hydrophobic “tails.” The
third hydroxyl group of the glycerol attaches to a phosphate group, which
is charged and therefore hydrophilic. This hydrophilic “head” attracts
water. When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into a

double-layered structure called a “bilayer.” The phosphate is on the
outside and the hydrophobic tails are on the inside, shielded from water.
This phospholipid bilayer is the structural basis of all plasma membranes.
It forms the boundary between the inside of the cell and the external
environment. (See Figure 2.10 and Figure 3.8 of the plasma membrane.)

Proteins
Proteins are complex, unbranched macromolecules that carry out many
functions in the body including:
Growth and repair
Signaling from one cell to
