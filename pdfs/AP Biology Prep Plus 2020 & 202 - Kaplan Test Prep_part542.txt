otides are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA. Millions of
nucleotides make up the DNA in each cell. However, because there is so
much DNA, our DNA is packaged into smaller tightly wound structures,
chromosomes. Because each nucleotide has a nitrogen base (A, C, G, T)
and it takes three bases to code for one amino acid, the average gene that
codes for 300 amino acids is approximately 900 nucleotides long. Each
chromosome may have hundreds to thousands of genes. Chromosomes
are made up of millions of nucleotides wound tight and held together by
histone proteins.

DNA AND RNA FUNCTIONS
The primary function of DNA is to serve as heritable genetic material,
containing the recipes for all of the proteins an organism can produce.
RNA, in contrast, has a variety of forms with diﬀering functions:
mRNA: messenger RNA; delivers genetic instru
