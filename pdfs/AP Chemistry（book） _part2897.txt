 convert the volume from gallons to mL.
Analyze We are asked to calculate the mass of CO2 produced when 
1.0 gallon of C8H18 reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and 
water.
Plan We first must determine the mass in grams of C8H18 in 1.0 
gallon of gasoline. We then write a balanced chemical equation 
for the combustion of C8H18 and use it to determine the theoreti-
cal yield of CO2.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Many cars can run on a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, 
C2H5OH (density = 0.789 g/mL). What mass of CO2 is pro-
duced by combustion of 1.0 gallon of ethanol?  
(a) 2.9 kg (b) 5.7 kg (c) 6.0 kg (d) 8.6 kg (e) 9.2 kg
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A typical propane, C3H8, tank for an outdoor grill contains 15 
pounds of propane. What mass of CO2 is produced by com-
busting the propane in such a tank?
11.0  gallon2a 3.785 L
1 gallonb a 1000 mL
1 L
b = 3.79 * 103 mL
2 C8H181l2 +  25 O21g2 S  16 CO21g2 +  18 H2O1g2
13.79 * 103 mL2a
0.70 g
mL b = 2.65 * 103 g
So we see that for every gallon o
