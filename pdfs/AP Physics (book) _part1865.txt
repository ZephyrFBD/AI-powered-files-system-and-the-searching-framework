ude of the potential difference V between

The constant of proportionality, C, in Eq. 17–7 is called the capacitance of
the capacitor. The unit of capacitance is coulombs per volt, and this unit is 
called a farad (F). Common capacitors have capacitance in the range of 1 pF
to 
The relation, Eq. 17–7,
was first suggested by Volta in the late eighteenth century.
In Eq. 17–7 and from now on, we will use simply V (in italics) to represent a
potential difference, such as that produced by a battery, rather than 
or
as previously.
Also, be sure not to confuse italic letters V and C which stand for voltage and
capacitance, with non-italic V and C which stand for the units volts and coulombs.
The capacitance C does not in general depend on Q or V. Its value depends
only on the size, shape, and relative position of the two conductors, and also on the
material that separates them. For a parallel-plate capacitor whose plates have area A
and are separated by a distance d of air (
