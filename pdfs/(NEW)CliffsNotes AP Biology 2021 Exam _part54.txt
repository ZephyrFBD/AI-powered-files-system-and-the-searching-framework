Although the functions of proteins are diverse, their structures are similar. All proteins are polymers of amino acids;
that is, they consist of a chain of amino acids covalently bonded. The bonds between the amino acids are called
peptide bonds, and the chain is a polypeptide, or peptide. Similar to the formation of carbohydrate polymers, the
peptide bonds of proteins form
by dehydration synthesis; that is, one H2O molecule is released during the
 
formation of each peptide bond.
 
One protein differs from another by the number and arrangement of the 20 different amino acids. Each amino acid
consists of a central carbon bonded
 
to an amino group (−NH2), a carboxyl group (−CO
