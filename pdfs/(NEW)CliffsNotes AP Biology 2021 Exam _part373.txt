chain. Whether animal or plant, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the food chain are
controversial. A major concern is one of health: Unidentified genes, accidently and unknowingly inserted into the
GM plant or animal, may produce products that create allergies.
4. Reproductive cloning. Traditional selective breeding of animals, where two animals with the desired traits are
bred, is a slow process. Each new generation must reach reproductive age before another round of selective breeding
can occur. Reproductive cloning, however, promises to produce, effectively within a single generation, copies of any
desirable individual. Many identical copies of exceptional individuals could be created using the best available
individualsâ€”a cow that produces the most milk, a prize winning race horse, or your favorite pet. So far, however,
reproductive cloning has had mediocre success. Problems include organ failure, a high susceptibility to disease,
shorter than normal life spans, and low suc
