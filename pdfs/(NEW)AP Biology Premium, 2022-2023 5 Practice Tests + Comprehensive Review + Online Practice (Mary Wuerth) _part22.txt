There is no guessing penalty on the AP Biology exam. If you leave a question
blank, you are guaranteed to not earn points for that question, so answer every question, even if you have to
guess. Never leave a question blank on the AP Biology exam! Reserve the last two or three minutes of the
time allotted for Section I to check that you have answered all of the questions and have not left any
questions blank.
Tips for Section II: Free-Response Questions
■Do NOT leave any questions blank. Even if you think you don’t know how to answer the question, reread
the question to see what terms in the question you do know something about. Then, use those terms as the
basis for your answer, keeping in mind the task verbs in the question. As in Section I, if you leave a question
blank, you are guaranteed to not earn points on that question, but if you write something, you may earn some
points that could make the difference between a score of a 3, 4, or 5. Never give up—remember, you CAN do
this!
