tatine, which is both extremely rare and radioactive, is omitted because many of its 
properties are not yet known. Even less is known about the recently discovered Tennessine.
Unlike the group 6A elements, all of the halogens that have been characterized are 
nonmetals. Their melting and boiling points increase with increasing atomic number. 
Fluorine and chlorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a 
solid. Each element consists of diatomic molecules: F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2 (Figure 7.28).

in a bottle with venting cap. Hydrogen 
peroxide is stored in opaque bottles like 
the one shown here because exposure 
to light leads to decomposition into H2O 
and O2.

expect the flattened ring to have?
