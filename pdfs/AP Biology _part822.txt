ter is 0. Therefore, the Ψs of a solution (something dissolved in
water) is always expressed as a negative number. For example, a 0.5 M
solution of glucose equals –1.22 MPa.
Pressure potential (Ψp) is the physical pressure on a solution. It can be
positive or negative, relative to atmospheric pressure. For example, when
you draw water up into a pipette, it is under negative pressure. In contrast,
when you expel water from a pipette, it is under positive pressure. The
water inside living cells is under positive pressure, pressing up against the
cell membrane and/or cell wall to maintain the cell’s shape and normal
function.
If you know the solute concentration, you can calculate solute potential
(Ψs) using the following formula (which is on the Reference Tables that
you will have access to during the exam):
Ψs=−iCRT
i = Number of particles the compound will release in water: for NaCl
(ionic), the number is 2; for sugar (a molecule), the number is 1.
C = Molar concentration determined fr
