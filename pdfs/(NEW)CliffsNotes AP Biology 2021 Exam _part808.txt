 (connected to a computer) for the pipette. Fill the tube and pipette completely with water. Cut the stem of a
plant seedling under water and quickly insert the seedling into the open end of the tube. Cutting the stem under
water reduces the chance of air entering the xylem. An air bubble in the xylem (or in the plastic tube) will expand
under the low pressure generated by transpiration (a process called cavitation) and break the continuity of the water
column. Apply petroleum jelly to seal the space between the stem of the seedling and the tube.
If equipment for a potometer is not available, you can measure the transpiration of an entire plant. Enclose the root
ball in a plastic bag and remove all the flowers (as they are likely to fall off). Most weight change over a period of
several days is the result of transpiration.
Repeat the above process for each environmental condition to be investigated. Alternatively, separate groups of
students can each investigate a different environment
