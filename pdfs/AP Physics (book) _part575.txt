pecific object or done on a specific object. It is
also important to specify whether the work done is due to one particular force (and
which one), or the total (net) work done by the net force on the object.

FIGURE 6–3 Example 6–1.
A 50-kg crate is pulled 
along a floor.
Work done on a crate. A person pulls a 50-kg crate 40 m
along a horizontal floor by a constant force  
which acts at a 37° angle
as shown in Fig. 6–3. The floor is rough and exerts a friction force  
Determine (a) the work done by each force acting on the crate, and (b) the net
work done on the crate.
APPROACH We choose our coordinate system so that the vector that repre-
sents the 40-m displacement is 
(that is, along the x axis). Four forces act on 
the crate, as shown in the free-body diagram in Fig. 6–3: the force exerted by
the person
