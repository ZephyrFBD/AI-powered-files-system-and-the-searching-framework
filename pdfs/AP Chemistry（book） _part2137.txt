he solubility of MnSO4 # H2O in water at 20 째C is 70 g per 
100 mL of water. (a) Is a 1.22 M solution of MnSO4 # H2O in 
water at 20 째C  saturated, supersaturated, or unsaturated? 
(b) Given a solution of MnSO4 # H2O of unknown concen-
tration, what experiment could you perform to determine 
whether the new solution is saturated, supersaturated, or 
unsaturated?
 13.25  By referring to Figure 13.15, determine whether the addi-
tion of 40.0 g of each of the following ionic solids to 100 g of 
water at 40 째C will lead to a saturated solution: (a) NaNO3, 
 
(b) KCl, (c) K2Cr2O7, (d) Pb1NO322.
 13.26  By referring to Figure 13.15, determine the mass of each 
of the following salts required to form a saturated solu-
tion in 250 g of water at 30 째C: (a) KClO3, (b) Pb1NO322, 
 
(c) Ce21SO423.
 13.27  Consider water and glycerol, CH21OH2CH1OH2CH2OH.  
(a) Would you expect them to be miscible in all propor-
tions? (b) List the intermolecular attractions that occur be-
tween a water molecule and
