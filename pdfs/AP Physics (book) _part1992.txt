18–7 Alternating Current
When a battery is connected to a circuit, the current moves steadily in one direc-
tion. This is called a direct current, or dc. Electric generators at electric power
plants, however, produce alternating current, or ac. (Sometimes capital letters are
used, DC and AC.) An alternating current reverses direction many times per second
and is commonly sinusoidal, Fig. 18–21. The electrons in a wire first move in one
direction and then in the other. The current supplied to homes and businesses by
electric companies is ac throughout virtually the entire world. We will discuss and
analyze ac circuits in detail in Chapter 21. But because ac circuits are so common
in real life, we will discuss some of th
