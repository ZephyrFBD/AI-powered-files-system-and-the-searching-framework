d by adding water. In all of the correct examples, complex
compounds are broken down to simpler compounds. The conversion of pyruvic acid to glucose is an
example of decarboxylationâ€”a carboxyl group is removed as carbon dioxide and the 2-carbon fragments
are oxidized.

Peroxisomes catalyze reactions that produce hydrogen peroxide, mitochondria contain enzymes involved
in cellular respiration, and ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis. Eliminate (B) and (D) because
lysosomes are the sites of degradation; they contain hydrolytic enzymes but do not produce hydrogen
peroxide. Choice (C) is incorrect, as the Golgi apparatus sorts and packages substances that are destined
to be secreted out of the cell.

The figure shows that water leaves the descending limb and flows by osmotic pressure into the
surrounding space and then into the vasa recta. This means that each of those places is more hypertonic
than the previous. The most hypotonic is the descending tubule. (This is why t
