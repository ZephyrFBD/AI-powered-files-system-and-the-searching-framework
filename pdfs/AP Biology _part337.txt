s the phage lyses one cell and infects another during the lytic
cycle. Restricted transduction involves the transfer of specific
pieces of DNA. During the lysogenic cycle, a phage integrates into
the host cell at a specific site. At a later time, when the phage
ruptures out of the host DNA, it sometimes carries a piece of
adjacent host DNA with it and inserts this host DNA into the next

The reproductive cycles of viruses transfer genetic information via transposons and
transduction.
The Genetics of Bacteria
The bacterial chromosome is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule,
tightly condensed into a structure with a small amount of protein. It is
located in a nucleoid region that has no nuclear membrane. Bacteria
replicate their DNA in both directions from a single point of origin.
Although bacteria can reproduce by a primitive sexual method called
conjugation, the main mode of reproduction is asexual, by binary f
