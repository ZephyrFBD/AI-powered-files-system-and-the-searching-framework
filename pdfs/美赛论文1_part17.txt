encing function are agreed by the 
majority of the people. 
 We will set a certain index to distinguish sustainable and unsustainable 
development, which will present whether effects are positive or not. 
 Combining effects with the last index we gain in the Chapter 2.3, we can gain the 
final index, which shows that the index of this main factor. If the final index is 
negative, we will view index as zero. If the final index is more than one, we will 
view index as one. This kind of situation will only occur in the country which is 
in zero development or ideal country, not in real life, so there is no differentiation. 
According to such a situation, we do the approximate processing to ensure that 
the final index is in the range of zero and one. 
We consider the relations between society, economy and ecology. Based on the 
assumptions, we only need to describe the relationship between one part to another, 
which can be showed in the simulation of the corresponding function. Then ac
