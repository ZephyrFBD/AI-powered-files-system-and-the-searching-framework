0 μatm, 1,000 μatm, and 
2,100 μatm for each temperature. 
(a) 
Describe the effect of increased biodiversity on the resilience of an ecosystem in a 
changing environment. 
• 
(Ecosystem) resilience/it will be greater (with increased biodiversity). 
1 point 
(b) 
 Justify the scientists’ selecting 5°C as the lowest temperature and 400 μatm as the lowest 
2
CO  level in their study of sand lance embryo survival. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
These are the normal/current conditions at which the embryos develop and were 
used as a basis for comparison. 
• 
These (current) conditions were used as a basis to compare the effects of changes in 
environmental conditions/increases in temperature and 
2
CO . 
1 point 
(c) 
State a null hypothesis for the experiment. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
Climate change will have no effect on sand lance (embryo) survival/sand lance 
development/the size of sand lance populations. 
• 
(Increases in) temperature/
2
CO  levels will have no effect on
