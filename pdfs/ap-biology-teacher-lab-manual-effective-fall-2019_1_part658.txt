fter asking the presenter 
a number of questions. With a number of observers reviewing several posters, each 
presenter receives diverse feedback about his or her work and presentation. This serves 
as a very effective peer review. Before a final grade for the lab work is assigned, the 
student is encouraged to revise his or her poster (mini-poster) based on feedback from 
the observers. The two groups then switch roles for the second half of the presentation

management by the teacher or by a student assigned to the task. The NABT blog entry 
includes information and links to information about contents of a simple rubric.

The first five resources provide students and teachers with examples of research that 
focuses specifically on the concepts and organisms in this laboratory. The hope is that 
students and teachers will find inspiration for their own work in these refere
