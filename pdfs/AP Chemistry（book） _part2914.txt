ctive agricultural 
areas in the world. Unfortunately, the premise that 
the aquifer is an inexhaustible source of fresh water 
proved false. Recharge of the aquifer from surface 
water is slow, taking hundreds, perhaps thousands 
of years. Water levels in parts of the southern half 
of the aquifer have fallen by more than 50 m over 
the past seven decades, making the costs of bring-
ing water to the surface prohibitive. As aquifer lev-
els continue to drop, less water will be available for 
the needs of cities, residences, and businesses.
