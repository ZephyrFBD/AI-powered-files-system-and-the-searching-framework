or in the cytosol of the target cell (as is the case for
hydrophobic ligands). Receptors contain ligand-specific binding domains. If a cell does not have the receptor
for a specific ligand, the cell will not respond to that ligand. Upon the binding of the ligand to the receptor,
the receptor undergoes a conformational (shape) change, which triggers the next step in the process on the
inside of the cell. Examples of receptors include G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.
2. Transduction: This is the series of chemical reactions (triggered by the binding of the ligand to its receptor)
that helps the cell choose the appropriate response. This is often the most complicated part of signal
transduction. Possible components of transduction include:
■Signaling cascades, a series of chemical reactions in which one molecule activates multiple molecules,
amplifying the cell’s response to a signal (a process called signal amplification)
■Kinases, which can transfer phosphate g
