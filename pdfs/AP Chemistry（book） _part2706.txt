affects the buffer composition. Then we 
use the resulting buffer composition and either the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation or the equilibrium-constant expression for 
the buffer to determine the pH.

Solve
(a) Stoichiometry Calculation: The OH- provided 
by NaOH reacts with CH3COOH, the 
weak acid component of the buffer. Since 
volumes are changing, it is prudent to ﬁgure 
out how many moles of reactants and prod-
ucts would be produced, then divide by the 
ﬁnal volume later to obtain concentrations. 
Prior to this neutralization reaction, there 
are 0.300 mol each of CH3COOH and 
CH3COO-. The amount of base added 
is 0.0050 L * 4.0 mol>L = 0.020 mol. 
Neutralizing the 0.020 mol OH- requires 
0.020 mol of CH3COOH. Consequently, 
the amount of CH3COOH decreases by 
0.020 mol, and the amount of the product 
of the neutralizat
