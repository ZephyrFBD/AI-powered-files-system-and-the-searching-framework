ter sensors for data collection, 
though they can be used if available. It is recommended 
that instructors have a computer and projector to 
show computer-based animations and simulations for 
pre-lab activities or post-lab discussions. However, a 
paper-based alternative can easily be provided if the 
equipment is unavailable. Students may use computers 
or graphing calculators to analyze data and present 
their findings, but they do not need to do so. 
We encourage you to be creative in designing a 
lab program while ensuring students explore and 
develop understandings of core techniques. After 
completion, students should be able to
to collect data, use data to form conclusions, and 
apply their conclusions to larger biological concepts. 
Students should report recorded data and quantitative 
conclusions drawn from the data with appropriate 
precision (i.e., significant figures). Students should 
also develop an understanding of how changes in the 
design of the experiments would
