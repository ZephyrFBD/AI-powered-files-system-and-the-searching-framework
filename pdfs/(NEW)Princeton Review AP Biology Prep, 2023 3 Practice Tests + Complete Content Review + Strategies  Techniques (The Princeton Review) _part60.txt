sed reaction rate when ascorbic acid is
present. Choice (A) is not true because similarly charged amino acids would repel each other and RZN45 and
JB-76 bind to each other. There is nothing to suggest that (B) is correct. Choice (C) would make sense since
both ascorbic acid and JB-76 bind to the same place, so they probably have similar structures. Choice (D)
could be true, but it is unlikely. Even things that are the same shape do not necessarily have the same number
of amino acids. Proteins are often hundreds of amino acids long, so having the exact same number is like a
needle in a haystack.

The graph shows that at low/medium levels of substrate the reaction rate is low in the presence of ascorbic acid
and then at high levels of substrate the reaction rate is high, even with ascorbic acid present. This is because
with lots of substrate, the ascorbic acid does not stand a chance at finding a free active site to bind to because
the superfluous amount of substrate is likely to be
