44. How do natural killer cells react to healthy cells
compared to cells infected with a pathogen?
a.
Natural killer cells recognize MHC I on a
healthy cell and do not kill it, while the infected
cells that do not present MHC I are killed.
b.
Natural killer cells recognize MHC I on an
infected cell and kill it, while the healthy cells
that do not present MHC I are not killed.
c.
Natural killer cells recognize MHC II on a
healthy cell and do not kill it, while the infected
cells that do not present MHC II are killed.
d.
Natural killer cells recognize MHC II on an
infected cell and kill it, while the healthy cells
that do not present MHC II are not killed.
