Analyze We are given that a solution contains 25.0% by mass of a 
nonvolatile, nonelectrolyte solute and asked to calculate the boil-
ing and freezing points of the solution. To do this, we need to cal-
culate the boiling-point elevation and freezing-point depression.
Comment Notice that the solution is a liquid over a larger tempera-
ture range than the pure solvent.
