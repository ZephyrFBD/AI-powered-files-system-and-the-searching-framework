ecomes a positively charged ion. For photoionization to occur, therefore, a molecule 
must absorb a photon, and the photon must have enough energy to remove an electron. 
 (Section 7.4) Notice that this is a very different process from photodissociation.
Four important photoionization processes occurring in the atmosphere above about 
90 km are shown in Table 18.3. Photons of any wavelength shorter than the maximum 
lengths given in the table have enough energy to cause photoionization. A look back at 
Figure 18.3 shows you that virtually all of these high-energy photons are filtered out of 
the radiation reaching Earth because they are absorbed by the upper atmosphere.
Comment Thus, light of wavelength 242 nm, which is in the ul-
traviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, has sufficient 
energy per photon to photodissociate an O2 molecule. Because 
photon energy increases as wavelength decreases, any photon of 
wavelength shorter than 242 nm will have sufficient energy to 
diss
