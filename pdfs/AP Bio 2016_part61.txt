20. A group of students designed an experiment
to determine the effect of compost on the
germination and growth of plants. The students
set up experimental plots by mixing different
ratios of soil and compost. They planted 20 pea
and 20 melon seeds in each plot and watered each
plot regularly. The students recorded the number
of seeds that germinated, and as the plants grew,
they recorded plant length, number and size of
leaves, and general health observations.
The following observations were recorded.
• In all treatments, more pea seeds
germinated than melon seeds.  
• There was a week of rainy weather at
three weeks. 
• Melon plants developed a fungal growth at
four weeks.  
• Melon plants grew longer than pea plants,
but many melon leaves showed signs of 
yellowing as the weeks passed.  
The students concluded that pea plants grew 
better in compost than did melon plants. 
Which of the following best addresses the validity 
of the conclusion made
