an recombination of the alleles for wing length
and aristae length.
b.
Recombination of the body color and aristae
length alleles will occur more frequently than
recombination of red/ brown eye alleles and the
aristae length alleles.
c.
Recombination of the gray/black body color and
long/short aristae alleles will not occur.
d.
Recombination of the red/brown eye and long/
short aristae alleles will occur more frequently
than recombination of the alleles for wing length
and body color.
