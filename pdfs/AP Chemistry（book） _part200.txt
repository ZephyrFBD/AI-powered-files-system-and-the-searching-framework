Conversions Involving Volume
The conversion factors previously noted convert from one unit of a given measure to an-
other unit of the same measure, such as from length to length. We also have conversion 
factors that convert from one measure to a different one. The density of a substance, for 
example, can be treated as a conversion factor between mass and volume. Suppose we 
want to know the mass in grams of 2 cubic inches 12.00 in.32 of gold, which has a density 
of 19.3 g>cm3. The density gives us the conversion factors:
19.3 g
1 cm3 and 1 cm3
19.3 g
Because we want a mass in grams, we use the first factor, which has mass in grams in 
the numerator. To use this factor, however, we must first convert cubic inches to  
cubic 
centimeters. The relationship between in.3 and cm3 is not given on the back inside cover, 
but the relationship between inches and centimeters is given: 1 in. = 2.54 cm (exactly).
