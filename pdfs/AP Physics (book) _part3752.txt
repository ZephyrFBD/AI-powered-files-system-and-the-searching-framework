xplaining why the universe is flat, as well as the thermal equilibrium to
provide the nearly uniform CMB, as discussed below.
When inflation ended, whatever energy caused it then ended up being
transformed into elementary particles with very high kinetic energy, corresponding
to very high temperature (Eq. 13–8,
). That process is referred to as
reheating, and the universe was now a “soup” of leptons, quarks, and other
particles. We can think of this “soup” as a plasma of particles and antiparticles,
as well as photons—all in roughly equal numbers—colliding with one another
frequently and exchanging energy.
The temperature of the universe at the end of inflation was much lower than
that expected by the hot Big Bang theory. But it would have been high enough so
that the weak and electromagnetic forces were unified into a single force, and
this stage of the universe is sometimes called the electroweak era. Approximately
s after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped to about 
K correspondi
