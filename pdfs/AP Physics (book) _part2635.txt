 equations and obtain
Then, by Eq. 23–4,
and
so we have
which is Snell’s law of refraction, Eq. 23–5. (The law of reflection can be derived
from Huygens’ principle in a similar way.)
When a light wave travels from one medium to another, its frequency does not
change, but its wavelength does. This can be seen from Fig. 24–3, where each of the
blue lines representing a wave front corresponds to a crest (peak) of the wave. Then
where, in the last step, we used Eq. 23–4,
If medium 1 is a vacuum (or
air), so 
and we call 
simply 
then the wavelength in another
medium of index of refraction 
will be
(24;1)
This result is consistent with the frequency f being unchanged no matter what
medium the wave is traveling in, since
