Explain an advantage the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has for DNA research.
a.
The process of PCR can isolate a particular piece of DNA for copying, which allows scientists to copy
millions of strands of DNA in a short amount of time.
b.
The process of PCR can purify a particular piece of DNA, and very small amounts of DNA can be used for
purification.
c.
The process of PCR separates and analyzes DNA and its fragments, which requires very little DNA.
d.
The process of PCR anneals DNA molecules to complementary DNA strands, which maintains the same
amount of DNA.
