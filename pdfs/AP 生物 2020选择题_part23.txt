of the experiment.

17. Which of the following best explains the result
of adult corals being exposed to elevated
temperatures for extended periods?
(A) They are able to obtain more energy from
their symbionts because the algae are
receiving more light. 
(B)
They are able to obtain more energy from
their symbionts because the efficiency
increases slightly over time. 
(C)
They are able to obtain less energy from
their symbionts because the algae have
been expelled. 
(D) They are able to obtain less energy from
their symbionts because more DMSP is
being produced at lower temperatures. 
18. A particular gene has two alleles, a dominant
allele A and a recessive allele a. The frequency
of allele A is 0.55. If the population is in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the
gene, then what is the expected frequency of
genot
