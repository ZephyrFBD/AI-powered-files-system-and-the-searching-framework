ommunity is called the climax community. The climax community
is the most stable. In our example, deciduous trees are part of the climax community.
Now what happens when a forest is devastated by fire? The same principles apply, but the events occur much more
rapidly. The only exception is that the first invaders are usually not lichens, but grasses, shrubs, saplings, and weeds.
When a new community develops where another community has been destroyed or disrupted, this event is called
secondary succession. The existing community can be cleared by events such as fire, tornado, or human impact.
These impacts leave soil intact, explaining how development occurs more rapidly.
HUMAN IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
Unfortunately, humans have disturbed the existing ecological balance, and the results are far-reaching. Soils have
been eroded and various forms of pollution have increased. Potential consequences on the environment are
summarized below.
