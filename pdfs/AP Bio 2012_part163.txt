with abundant fixed nitrogen, 
heterocysts are not an advantage to the organism in that the anaerobic nitrogen-
fixing enzymes are not needed.
(D)
This option is incorrect because loss of the hetR gene would prevent, not induce, 
heterocyst formation.

Question 60
Essential Knowledge
3.C.3: Viral replication results in genetic variation,  
and viral infection can introduce genetic variation into 
the hosts. 
Science Practice
1.4: The student can use representations and models  
to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively  
and quantitatively.
Learning Objective 
3.30: The student is able to use representations and 
appropriate models to describe how viral replication 
introduces genetic variation in the viral population.
(A)
This option is incorrect because bacterial DNA, not protein, is transferred by  
the phage.
(B)
This option is incorrect because the recipient does not incorporate (add) the 
transduced DNA into its chromosome. The transduced DNA must recombin
