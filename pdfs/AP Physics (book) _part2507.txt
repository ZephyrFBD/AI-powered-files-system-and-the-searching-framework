d as an electromagnetic wave.
Although the ray model of light does not deal with this aspect of light (we discuss
the wave nature of light in Chapter 24), the ray model has been very successful 
in describing many aspects of light such as reflection, refraction, and the formation
of images by mirrors and lenses. Because these explanations involve straight-line
rays at various angles, this subject is referred to as geometric optics.
23–2 Reflection; Image Formation
by a Plane Mirror
When light strikes the surface of an object, some of the light is reflected. The rest
can be absorbed by the object (and transformed to thermal energy) or, if the object
is transparent like glass or water, part can be transmitted through. For a very
smooth shiny object such as a silvered mirror, over 95% of the light may be reflected.
