ture increases the number of synaptic connections and
the training can be induced in vitro. Cells that had acquired
the stimulus-response behavior were treated with an agent
that destroys the synaptic receptors. Yet the trained
response was retained and there were indications that the
information was retrieved from the neuron nucleus.
E. Suppose that this work concerning the location of
memory is confirmed. Create a representation of
information flow in which a fourth box labeled “neuron
nucleus” is added to the diagram in part A between the
stimulus and the neuron. Annotate the representation to
indicate the flow of information.
Explain Pose questions regarding the ethical or social
consequences of this technology.
•
how this form of plasticity is more dynamic than
theories in which memory resides in synaptic or
dendritic structures, and
•
how it might lead to a treatments for disorders, such
as post-traumatic stress syndrome, in which
recollection creates a disability.
