Railroad cars again. For the completely inelastic collision
of the two railroad cars that we considered in Example 7–3, calculate how much
of the initial kinetic energy is transformed to thermal or other forms of energy.
APPROACH The railroad cars stick together after the collision, so this is a 
completely inelastic collision. By subtracting the total kinetic energy after the
collision from the total initial kinetic energy, we can find how much energy is
transformed to other types of energy.
SOLUTION Before the collision, only car A is moving, so the total initial
kinetic energy is  
After the
collision, both cars are moving with half the speed,
by conserva-
tion of momentum (Example 7–3). So the total kinetic energy afterward is 
Hence the
energy transformed to other forms is
which is half the
