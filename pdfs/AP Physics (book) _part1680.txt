s must generally be expressed in kelvins;
temperature differences may be expressed in CÂ° or K.
5. Efficiency (or coefficient of performance) is a ratio
of two energy transfers: useful output divided by
required input. Efficiency (but not coefficient of
performance) is always less than 1 in value, and
hence is often stated as a percentage.
6. The entropy of a system increases when heat is added
to the system, and decreases when heat is removed.
If heat is transferred from system A to system B,
the change in entropy of A is negative and the change
in entropy of B is positive.

Thermodynamics
1. Define the system you are dealing with; distinguish
the system under study from its surroundings.
2. When applying the first law of thermodynamics, be
careful of signs associated with work and heat. In the
first law, work done by the system is positive; work
done on the system is negative. Heat added to the
system is positive, but heat removed from it is negative.
