it
is used to build carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. Carbon is
used in storage compounds and cell formation in all organisms.
The basis of the carbon cycle are the reciprocal processes of
photosynthesis and respiration.

Organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce, and
maintain organization.
Cell respiration by animals and bacterial decomposers adds CO2 to
the air and removes O2.
The burning of fossil fuels adds CO2 to the air.
Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the air and adds O2.
The major reservoirs of carbon are fossil fuels and plant and animal
biomass. Carbon is also found in the soil, in dissolved carbon compounds
in the oceans, in sediments in aquatic ecosystems, and in the atmosphere as
CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CO (carbon monoxide).
The Nitrogen Cycle
Remember: Nitrogen moves from the environment to organisms, where it
is used in building proteins and nucleic acids.
