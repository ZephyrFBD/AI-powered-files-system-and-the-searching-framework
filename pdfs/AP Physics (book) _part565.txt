xy?
A2 * 1030 kgB,
A1 ly = 9.5 * 1015 mB.
1. Reread each Example in this Chapter and identify (i) the
object undergoing centripetal acceleration (if any), and 
(ii) the force, or force component, that causes the circular
motion.
2. Redo Example 5â€“3, precisely this time, by not ignoring 
the weight of the ball which revolves on a string 0.600 m
long. In particular, find the magnitude of 
and the 
angle it makes with the horizontal. [Hint: Set the horizon-
tal component of 
equal to 
also, since there is 
no vertical motion, what can you say about the vertical
component of 
]
3. A banked curve of radius R in a new highway is designed
so that a car traveling at speed 
can negotiate the turn
safely on glare ice (zero friction). If a car travels too slowly,
then it will slip toward the center of the circle. If it travels
too fast, it will slip away from the center of the circle. If 
the coefficient of static friction increases, it becomes possi-
ble for a car to stay on the road while trave
