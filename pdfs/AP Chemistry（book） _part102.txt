they take root. Each 
Smart Figure converts a static in-text figure into a 
dynamic process narrated by author Matt Stoltzfus. 
Play icons within the text identify each Smart 
Figure. Clicking the icon in the eText launches 
the animation. Smart Figures are assignable in 
MasteringChemistryTM where they are accompanied 
by a multiple-choice question with answer-specific 
video feedback. Selecting the correct answer 
launches a brief wrap-up video that highlights the 
key concepts behind the answer.
REVISED! Annotations 
offer expanded 
explanations; additional 
new leaders emphasize 
key relationships and key 
points in figures.
NEW! Before and after photos 
clearly show characteristics of 
endothermic and exothermic 
reactions. Added reaction 
equations connect the chemistry 
to whatâ€™s happening in the 
photos.
