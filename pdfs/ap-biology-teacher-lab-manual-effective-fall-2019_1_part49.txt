 a test tube rack on 
the lab table. Do not touch the vial while making observations.
c. 
Invert the vial and observe the position of the flies after 15 seconds and after 30 
seconds. Make a list of observed behaviors.
d. Observations should generate questions, including What was the flies’ response? 
Was there an orientation movement? If so, what was the stimulus? Could this be 
considered a taxis? Explain your answers.
Getting Started is designed to help 
you determine your students’ prior 
knowledge, understanding of key 
concepts, and skill level. Although 
you are encouraged to develop your 
own means of assessment, the lab 
investigations in this manual include 
suggestions. Assessments can include 
question sets that you assign for 
homework, collaborative activities, 
and interactive online simulations.
