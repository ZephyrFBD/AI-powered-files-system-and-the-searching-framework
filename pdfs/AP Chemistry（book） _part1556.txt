mercury surface in the 
dish experiences the full force of Earthâ€™s atmosphere, which pushes the mercury up the 
tube until the pressure exerted by the mercury column downward, due to gravity, equals 
the atmospheric pressure at the base of the tube. Therefore the height, h, of the mercury 
column is a measure of atmospheric pressure and changes as atmospheric pressure changes.
Standard atmospheric pressure, which corresponds to the typical pressure at 
sea level, is the pressure sufficient to support a column of mercury 760 mm high. In SI 
units, this pressure is 1.01325 * 105 Pa. Standard atmospheric pressure defines some 
common non-SI units used to express gas pressure, such as the atmosphere (atm) and 
the millimeter of mercury (mm Hg). The latter unit is also called the torr, after Torricelli: 
1 torr = 1 mm Hg. Thus, we have
1 atm = 760. mm Hg = 760. torr = 1.01325 * 105 Pa = 101.325 kPa = 1.01325 bar
We will express gas pressure in a variety of units throughout this chapter, so
