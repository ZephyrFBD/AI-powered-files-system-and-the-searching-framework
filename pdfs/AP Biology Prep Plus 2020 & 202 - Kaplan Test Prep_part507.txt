 input is called feedback, and organisms all possess
feedback mechanisms in order to respond to stimuli. These mechanisms
usually fall into two categories: positive and negative feedback.
Positive feedback results when the eﬀects of feedback from a system
result in an increase in the original factor that causes the disturbance.
Positive feedback mechanisms increase or accelerate the output created
by a stimulus that has already been activated. For example, if you have a
bank account that is earning interest, the amount of interest grows every
time the account increases. The higher the account balance, the more
interest is earned and the balance increases even more. This can go on
and on until some other mechanism (such as withdrawing money from
your account) causes a disruption in the positive feedback cycle. If there
is no mechanism to stop the positive feedback loop, then the system can
