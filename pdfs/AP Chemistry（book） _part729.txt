CHAPTER 5 Thermochemistry
In many situations, we will find it valuable to know the sign and magnitude of the 
enthalpy change associated with a given chemical process. As we see in the following 
sections, ∆H can be either determined directly by experiment or calculated from known 
enthalpy changes of other reactions.
5.5 ∣ Calorimetry
The value of ∆H can be determined experimentally by measuring the heat flow accompanying 
a reaction at constant pressure. Typically, we can determine the magnitude of the heat flow 
by measuring the magnitude of the temperature change the heat flow produces. The measure-
ment of heat flow is calorimetry; a device used to measure heat flow is a calorimeter.
