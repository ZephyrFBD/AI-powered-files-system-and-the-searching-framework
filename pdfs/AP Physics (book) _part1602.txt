rk is done on the system. What is the change in internal energy
of the system?
APPROACH We apply the first law of thermodynamics, Eq. 15–1, to our system.
SOLUTION The heat added to the system is 
The work W done
by the system is 
Why the minus sign? Because 1800 J done on the
system (as given) equals 
done by the system, and it is the latter we need
for the sign conventions we used for Eq. 15–1. Hence
NOTE We did this calculation in detail to emphasize the importance of keeping
careful track of signs. Both the heat and the work are inputs to the system, so we
expect 
to be increased by both.
¢U
¢U = 2500 J - (–1800 J) = 2500 J + 1800 J = 4300 J.
–1800 J
–1800 J.
Q = 2500 J.
EXAMPLE 15;1
EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15–1 if 2500 J of
heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?
