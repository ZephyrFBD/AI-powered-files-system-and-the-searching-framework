 7.40  Identify each statement as true or false: (a) Ionization energies 
are always negative quantities. (b) Oxygen has a larger ﬁrst 
ionization energy than ﬂuorine. (c) The second ionization

 7.21  Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal in the 
periodic table: 3422 °C. The distance between W atoms in 
tungsten metal is 2.74 Å. (a) What is the atomic radius of a 
tungsten atom in this environment? (This radius is called 
the metallic radius.) (b) If you put tungsten metal under 
high pressure, predict what would happen to the distance 
between W atoms.
 7.22  Which of the following statements about the bonding atomic 
radii in Figure 7.7 is incorrect? (i) For a given period, the radii 
of the representative elements generally decrease from left 
to right across a period. (ii) The radii of the representative 
elements for the n = 3 period are all larger than those of the 
corresponding elements in the n = 2 period. (iii)
