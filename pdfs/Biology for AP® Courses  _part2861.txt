along a track: watch a short video lesson
(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/feedback_loops) on positive and negative feedback loops.
Voltage-gated sodium channels occur in the cell membranes of nerve cells. They open in response to sodium entering
the cell, which in turn, allows more sodium to enter the cell. Is this a positive or negative feedback loop and why?
a.
This is a positive feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx and
then close when enough sodium has entered through the channels.
b.
This is a negative feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx and
then close when enough sodium has entered through the channels.
c.
This is a positive feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx, which
allows more sodium to go in through the channels.
d.
This is a negative feedback loop as voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to sodium influx, which
allows more sodium to go in
