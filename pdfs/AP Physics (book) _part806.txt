FIGURE 8;6 On a rotating wheel
whose angular speed is increasing,
a point P has both tangential and
radial (centripetal) components of
linear acceleration. (See also 
Chapter 5.)
Angular and linear velocities. A carousel is initially at rest.
At 
it is given a constant angular acceleration 
which
increases its angular velocity for 8.0 s. At 
determine (a) the angular
velocity of the carousel, and (b) the linear velocity of a child (Fig. 8–7a) located
2.5 m from the center, point P in Fig. 8–7b.
APPROACH The angular acceleration 
is constant, so we can use 
(Eq. 8–3a) to solve for 
after a time 
With this , we determine the
linear velocity using Eq. 8–4,
.
SOLUTION (a) In Eq. 8–3a,
we put
and
Solving for 
we get
