FIGURE 5;29 Kepler’s second law.
The two shaded regions have equal
areas. The planet moves from point 1
to point 2 in the same time it takes to
move from point 3 to point 4. Planets
move fastest when closest to the Sun.
Kepler’s Laws
Also about 1600, more than a half century before Newton proposed his three laws
of motion and his law of universal gravitation, the German astronomer Johannes
Kepler (1571–1630) had worked out a detailed description of the motion of the
planets around the Sun. Kepler’s work resulted in part from the many years he
spent examining data collected (without a telescope) by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601)
on the positions of the planets in their motion through the night sky.
Among Kepler’s writings were three empirical findings that we now refer to
as Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. These are summarized as follows, with
additional explanation in Figs. 5–28 and 5–29.
