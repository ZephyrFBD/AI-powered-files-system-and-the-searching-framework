ic solvent. In 2008, a team of 
Italian chemists found a way to remove the polymer coatings with-
out damaging the underlying fresco. They treated the murals with a 
microemulsion, a special type of mixture where molecules called sur-
factants encapsulate and carry nanometer-sized droplets of organic 
solvents through an aqueous solution to the surface of the fresco. 
Once the droplets reach the surface, they can dissolve and carry away 
the unwanted polymer coating.

Precision and Accuracy
The terms precision and accuracy are often used in discussing the uncertainties of measured val-
ues. Precision is a measure of how closely individual measurements agree with one another. 
Accuracy refers to how closely individual measurements agree with the correct, or “true,” 
value. The dart analogy in Figure 1.24 illustr
