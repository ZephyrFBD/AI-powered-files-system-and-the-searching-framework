C. Using these data, estimate the length of time of the cell cycle, including an estimate of precision by calculating the
standard deviation.
Growth factors are signals that initiate cell division in eukaryotes. (The data in the table above show that cells in
the plant root less than a mm from the root tip are showing a reduction of growth rate.) The interaction of two plant
hormones, auxin and brassinosteroids, have been shown [Chaiwanon and Wang, Cell, 164(6), 1257, 2016] to regulate
cell division in root tips. Auxin concentrations are higher near the root tip and decrease with distance from the tip.
Brassinosteroids decrease in concentration near the root tip. Auxin is actively transported between cells, whereas
brassinosteroids have limited transport between cells.
D. Based on these data and the observed distribution of brassinosteroids and auxin in the growing root, predict a
mechanism for their interaction and justify the claim that brassinosteroid synthesis
