MisConceptual Question 4.
11. A small mass m on a string is rotating without friction in a
circle. The string is shortened by pulling it through the axis
of rotation without any external torque, Fig. 8–39. What
happens to the tangential velocity of the object?
(a) It increases.
(b) It decreases.
(c) It remains the same.
12. If there were a great migration of people toward the Earth’s
equator, the length of the day would
(a) increase because of conservation of angular momentum.
(b) decrease because of conservation of angular momentum.
(c) decrease because of conservation of energy.
(d) increase because of conservation of energy.
(e) remain unaffected.
13. Suppose you are sitting on a rotating stool holding a 2-kg
mass in each outstretched hand. If you suddenly drop the
masses, your angular velocity will 
(a) increase.
(b) decrease.
(c) stay the same.
6. Two spheres have the same radius and equal mass. One
sphere is solid, and the other is hollow and made of a denser
material. Which one
