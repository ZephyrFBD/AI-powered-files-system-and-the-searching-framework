rmation about various organs of the body, such as the brain, heart,
liver, and kidneys, can be obtained. Although ultrasound does not replace X-rays, for
certain kinds of diagnosis it is more helpful. Some kinds of tissue or fluid are not
detected in X-ray photographs, but ultrasound waves are reflected from their bound-
aries. “Real-time” ultrasound images are like a movie of a section of the interior
of the body.
The pulse-echo technique for medical imaging works as follows. A brief
pulse of ultrasound is emitted by a transducer that transforms an electrical 
pulse into a sound-wave pulse. Part of the pulse is reflected as echoes at each
interface in the body, and most of the pulse (usually) continues on, Fig. 12–27a.
