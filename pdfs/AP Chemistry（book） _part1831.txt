 in the sun and reaches a 
temperature of 35 째C. Would you expect the pressure in the 
tank to be greater or less than atmospheric pressure? How 
does the pressure within the tank depend on how much 
liquid butane is in it? (b) Suppose the valve to the tank is 
opened and a few liters of butane are allowed to escape rap-
idly. What do you expect would happen to the tempera-
ture of the remaining liquid butane in the tank? Explain. 
 
(c) How much heat must be added to vaporize 250 g of 
butane if its heat of vaporization is 21.3 kJ>mol? What vol-
ume does this much butane occupy at 755 torr and 35 째C?
 11.95  Using information in Appendices B and C, calculate the 
minimum grams of propane, C3H81g2, that must be com-
busted to provide the energy necessary to convert 5.50 kg 
of ice at -20 째C to liquid water at 75 째C.
 11.96  The vapor pressure of a volatile liquid can be determined 
by slowly bubbling a known volume of gas through it at a 
known temperature and pressure. In an experimen
