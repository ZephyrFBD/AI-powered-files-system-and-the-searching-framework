 14.10 The accompanying graph shows plots of ln k versus 1>T 
for two different reactions. The plots have been extrapo-
lated to the y-intercepts. Which reaction (red or blue) has 
(a) the larger value for Ea, and (b) the larger value for the 
frequency factor, A? [Section 14.5]

 14.12 Consider the diagram that follows, which represents two 
steps in an overall reaction. The red spheres are oxygen, 
the blue ones nitrogen, and the green ones fluorine. 
 
(a) Write the chemical equation for each step in the re-
action. (b) Write the equation for the overall reaction. 
 
(c) Identify the intermediate in the mechanism. (d) Write 
the rate law for the overall reaction if the first step is the 
slow, rate-determining step. [Section 14.6]
