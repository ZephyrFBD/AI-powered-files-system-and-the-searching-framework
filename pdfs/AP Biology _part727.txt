the pie chart. Of the four pie charts provided, the one for choice C
best depicts the relative energy budget of the 4 kg male Adélie
penguin.
(C) The gradient is steeper at –90 mV than it was at –70 mV. The
membrane is now hyperpolarized. The threshold is higher.
Depolarizing the membrane and passing an impulse are more
difficult.
(C) The stem of the question asks you to identify a graph that shows
the neuronal membrane becoming hyperpolarized (more polarized),
not depolarized. When a membrane becomes hyperpolarized, the
line on the graph moves downward, farther away from 0.0 mV, and
it is harder to pass an impulse. Choice A is incorrect because when
the neuron is stimulated, the value of the membrane potential drops
from about
