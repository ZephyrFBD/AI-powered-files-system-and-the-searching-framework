concentrated suspension 
of bacteria. A small amount of the bacterial suspension goes a long way. Under 
favorable conditions, one cell multiples to become millions of genetically identical 
cells in just 24 hours. There are millions of individual bacteria in a single millimeter 
of a bacterial colony. 
a. Insert a sterile inoculation loop straight into the vial of rehydrated bacterial 
culture. Remove the loop and streak the plates, as illustrated in Figure 1. Streaking 
takes place sequentially in four quadrants. The first streak spreads out the cells. Go 
back and forth with the loop about a dozen times in each of the small areas shown. 
In subsequent quadrants, the cells become more and more dilute, thus increasing 
the likelihood of producing single colonies.

After the initial streak,
