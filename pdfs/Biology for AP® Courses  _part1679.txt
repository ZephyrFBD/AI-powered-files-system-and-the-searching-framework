i, there are between
10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of
structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for
the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.
Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to
prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the
cytoplasm. Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate
during the initiation of translation. In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of
70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and
