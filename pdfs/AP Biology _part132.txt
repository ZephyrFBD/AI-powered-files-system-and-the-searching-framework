coiled and
condensed strand of DNA. A replicated chromosome consists of two sister
chromatids, where one is an exact copy of the other. The centromere is a
specialized region that holds the two chromatids together. The
kinetochore is a disc-shaped protein on the centromere that attaches the
chromatid to the mitotic spindle during cell division. Figure 4.1 shows a
sketch of a replicated chromosome.

THE CELL CYCLE
Living and dividing cells pass through a complex sequence of growth and
division called the cell cycle as shown in Figure 4.2. The timing and rate
of cell division are crucial to normal growth and development. In humans,
the frequency of cell division varies with the cell type. Bone marrow cells
are always dividing in order to produce a constant supply of red and white
blood cells. Liver cells are arrested in G0 (have stopped dividing) but can
be induced to divide or regenerate when liver tissue is damaged. Human
intestine cells normally divide about twice
