the railway station 
 
 at noon on Saturday and that’s handy because I can meet him there to 
 
 get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train.We stand at the gate 
 
 waiting and he tells me he hasn’t seen Rose in a year. She’s over there 
 
 working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn’t like that one bit because the 
 
 English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and 
 
 worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their 
 
  
  
 jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick 
 
 girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to 
 
 come back to like Gerry Halvey himself.He’ll be able to tell if she was 
 
 true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain 
 
 class of a walk that’s different from the one she went away with then you 
 
 345 
 
 know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards 
 
 that they are.
