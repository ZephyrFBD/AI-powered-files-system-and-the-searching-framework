 composed of eukaryotic cells.
All cells (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic) contain genetic material, ribosomes, cytosol, and a plasma
membrane. In prokaryotes, the genetic material (DNA) is a circular chromosome located in the center of the cell in
an area called the nucleoid region. Bacteria may also contain extra genetic material outside of the chromosome,
which is contained in small circular pieces of DNA called plasmids. In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into linear
chromosomes that are contained in a membrane-bound nucleus.

Ribosomes function in protein synthesis and are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Ribosomes are
made of proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes have a large subunit and
a small subunit, but the sizes of these subunits differ slightly, as shown in Figure 5.2.

While it IS important to know that the subunits of prokary
