ng Guidelines for Free-Response Question 1
(a) Describe whether the 0% and 100% solutions are hypertonic or
hypotonic relative to the eggs. Provide reasoning for your response. (4

Description (1 point each, 2 points maximum)
Reasoning (1 point each, 2 points maximum)
The 0% corn syrup (100% distilled water)
solution is hypotonic relative to the egg
The 100% corn syrup (0% distilled water)
solution is hypertonic relative to the egg
Egg gained mass in 0% corn syrup
Egg lost mass in 100% corn syrup
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The egg gained mass in the 0% corn syrup solution (100% distilled water),
indicating water moved into the egg because the water concentration was
greater outside the egg than inside. On the other hand, in the 100% corn syrup
solution (0% distilled water), the egg lost mass, indicating water moved out of
the egg because the water concentration was greater inside the egg than
outside. Therefore, the 0% corn syrup solution is hypo
