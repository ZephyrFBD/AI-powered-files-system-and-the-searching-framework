In the 1970s, scientists began to learn and report about a process
called eutrophication, a phenomenon found in freshwater lakes. The
process begins as leaky septic systems and fertilizer runoff from
surrounding farms and lawns adds chemical pollutants and/or
nutrients to lakes. These added nutrients promote the growth of
primary producers, like algae. The algae can grow so thick that it
prevents light from penetrating the water.
Predict what will happen if chemical runoff continues to add
nutrients to these lakes.
Algae will continue to grow, releasing large amounts of oxygen
into the water. This will cause the fish to die because large
amounts of oxygen are lethal to fish.
