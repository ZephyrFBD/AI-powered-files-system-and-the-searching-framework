SCIENCE PRACTICE CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
50. Prokaryotes have an adaptive strategy to identify and
respond to viral infections. This strategy uses segments of
the cyclic DNA called CRISPRs and genes encoding
CRISPR-associated (cas) proteins. When a virus enters the
cell, a strand of viral DNA is excised by a cas protein and
inserted into the bacterial DNA in a CRISPR region. When
the same viral DNA is encountered subsequently, this
foreign DNA is targeted by cas proteins that carry RNA
markers transcribed from the inserted segment. The cas
proteins cleave the viral DNA. The bacteria “remember”
the infec
