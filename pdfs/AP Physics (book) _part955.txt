is a straight line. Beyond this point, the graph deviates from
a straight line, and no simple relationship exists between F and 
Nonetheless,
up to a point farther along the curve called the elastic limit, the object will return
to its original length if the applied force is removed. The region from the origin 
to the elastic limit is called the elastic region. If the object is stretched beyond 
the elastic limit, it enters the plastic region: it does not return to the original length
upon removal of the external force, but remains permanently deformed (such as
a bent paper clip). The maximum elongation is reached at the breaking point. The
maximum force that can be applied without breaking is called the ultimate strength
of the material (actually, force per unit area, as we discuss in Section 9–6).
Young’s Modulus
The amount of elongation of an object, such as the rod shown in Fig. 9–18,
depends not only on the force applied to it, but also on the material of which it is
made and on i
