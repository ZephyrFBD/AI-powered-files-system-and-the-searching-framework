vers on the sidewalk hear the same
frequency from the fire truck at rest. (b) Doppler effect: observer
toward whom the fire truck moves hears a higher-frequency sound,
and observer behind the fire truck hears a lower-frequency sound.
Consider the siren of a fire truck at rest, which is emitting sound of a partic-
ular frequency in all directions as shown in Fig. 12–19a. The sound waves are
moving at the speed of sound in air,
which is independent of the velocity of
the source or observer. If our source, the fire truck, is moving, the siren emits sound
at the same frequency as it does at rest. But the sound wavefronts it emits forward,
in front of it, are closer together than when the fire truck is at rest, as shown in
Fig. 12–19b. This is because the fire truck, as it moves, is partly “catching up” to the
previously emitted wavefronts, and emits each crest closer to the previous one.Thus an
observer on the sidewalk in front of the truck will detect more wave crests passing
per second,
