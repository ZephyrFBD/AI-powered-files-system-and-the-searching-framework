Electricity is generated in space vehicles from the heat 
produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium-238:

2He. The atomic masses of plutonium-238 
and uranium-234 are 238.049554 amu and 234.040946 amu, 
respectively. The mass of an alpha particle is 4.001506 amu. 
How much energy in kJ is released when 1.00 g of pluto-
nium-238 decays to uranium-234?
(a) 2.27 * 106 kJ (b) 2.68 * 106 kJ (c) 3.10 * 106 kJ
(d) 3.15 * 106 kJ (e) 7.37 * 108 kJ
