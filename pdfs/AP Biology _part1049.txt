of the solution in an open container is zero.
The Solute Potential of a Solution
Ψs = – iCRT
i = ionization constant (For sucrose this is 1.0 because sucrose does not ionize in
water.)
C = molar concentration
R = pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter bars/mole K)
T = temperature in Kelvin (273 + °C)
Acid and Base: pH
pH = – log [H+]
