roups to other molecules (which activates those molecules)
■Phosphatases, which can remove phosphate groups from other molecules (which inactivates those
molecules)
■Enzymes, which produce secondary messengers; an example of this is the enzyme adenylyl cyclase,
which produces the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP
3. Response: This is the final step of signal transduction and the ultimate result generated by the ligand.
Examples of cellular responses include the activation of genes by steroid hormones, the opening of ligand-
gated ion channels, and the initiation of cell processes, such as apoptosis (programmed cell death).
Disruptions in Signal Transduction Pathways
Signal transduction pathways refer to the series of chemical reactions that mediate the sensing and processing of
stimuli. Disruptions in signal transduction pathways can have profound effects on cells. Since receptors are specific
to certain ligands, a mutation in a gene that is coding for a receptor protein c
