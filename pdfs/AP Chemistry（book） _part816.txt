f fixed volume called a bomb calorimeter. 
The heat transferred under constant-volume conditions is equal 
to ∆E. Corrections can be applied to ∆E values to yield ∆H.
HESS’S LAW (SECTION 5.6) Because enthalpy is a state func-
tion, ∆H depends only on the initial and final states of the system. 
Thus, the enthalpy change of a process is the same whether the 
process is carried out in one step or in a series of steps. Hess’s law 
states that if a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, ∆H for the 
reaction will be equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the 
steps. We can therefore calculate ∆H for any process, as long as we 
can write the process as a series of steps for which ∆H is known.
ENTHALPIES OF FORMATION (SECTION 5.7) The enthalpy of 
formation, ∆Hf, of a substance is the enthalpy change for the re-
action in which the substance is formed from its constituent el-
ements. Usually, enthalpies are tabulated for reactions where 
reactants and products are in their standa
