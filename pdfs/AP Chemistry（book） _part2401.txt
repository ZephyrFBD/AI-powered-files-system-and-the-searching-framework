t at a given temperature, an equilibrium among CaCO3, CaO, 
and CO2 always leads to the same CO2 partial pressure as long as all three components are 
present. As shown in Figure 15.8, we have the same CO2 pressure regardless of the relative 
amounts of CaO and CaCO3.

Write the equilibrium-constant expression Kc for
(a) CO21g2 + H21g2 ∆ CO1g2 + H2O1l2
(b) SnO21s2 + 2 CO1g2 ∆ Sn1s2 + 2 CO21g2
Sample Exercise 15.5
 Writing Equilibrium-Constant Expressions for Heterogeneous Reactions
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two chemical equations, both for het-
erogeneous equilibria, and asked to write the corresponding 
equilibrium-constant expressions.
Plan We use the law of mass action, remembering to omit any pure 
solids and pure liquids from the expressions.
Solve
(a) The equilibrium-constant expression is
Kc =
3CO4
3CO243H24
Because H2O appears in the reaction as a liquid, its concentra-
tion does not appear in the equilibrium-constant expression.
