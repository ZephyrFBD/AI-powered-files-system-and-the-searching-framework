Figure 1. Transpiration Model 
During transpiration, water evaporating from the spaces within leaves escapes 
through small pores called stomata. Although evaporation of water through open 
stomata is a major route of water loss in plants, the stomata must open to allow for 
the entry of CO2 used in photosynthesis. In addition, O2 produced in photosynthesis 
exits through open stomata. Consequently, a balance must be maintained between the 
transport of CO2 and O2 and the loss of water. Specialized cells called guard cells help 
regulate the opening and closing of stomata. To maintain homeostasis, plants must 
adjust their rates of transpiration in response to environmental conditions. 
This investigation encourages independent student thinking and ultimately provides 
the student with opportunities for more open-ended experimentation. In the first part of 
this investigation (stomatal peel), you gu
