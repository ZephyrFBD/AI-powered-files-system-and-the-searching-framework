s to break
the molecules loose from their relatively fixed positions in the solid so they can
freely roll over one another in the liquid phase. Similarly, energy is required for
molecules held close together in the liquid phase to escape into the gaseous phase
where they are far apart. This process is a more energetic reorganization of the
molecules than is melting (the average distance between the molecules is greatly
increased), and hence the heat of vaporization is generally much greater than the
heat of fusion for a given substance.
14â€“6 Heat Transfer: Conduction
Heat is transferred from one place or object to another in three different ways:
by conduction, by convection, and by radiation. We now discuss each of these in
turn; but in practical situations, any two or all three may be operating at the same
time. This Section deals with conduction.
When a metal poker is put in a hot fire, or a silver spoon is placed in a hot
bowl of soup, the exposed end of the poker or spoon soon bec
