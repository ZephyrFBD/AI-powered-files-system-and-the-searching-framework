 However, the iodine solution in the beaker will remain unchanged
because the starch molecules are too large to diffuse out of the bag and
mix with the iodine. See Figure 19.7.

PART 2B: CALCULATE THE MOLARITY OF AN
UNKNOWN SOLUTION BY OBSERVING OSMOSIS.
Fashion 6 lengths of semipermeable dialysis tubing into 6 bags. Fill 5 of
them with sucrose solutions of varying molarities: 0.2 M, 0.4 M, 0.6 M,
0.8 M, and 1.0 M. Fill 1 with distilled water. (The molecules of sucrose are
too large to diffuse through the dialysis membrane.) Remove as much air
from each bag as possible to allow room for expansion. Blot and weigh
each bag. Place each bag into a beaker that contains distilled water. Allow
them to sit for 30 minutes. Then remove the bags from the beakers. Blot
and weigh the bags as before. Calculate the percent change in mass for
each bag. Record and graph the data with the dependent variable (percent
change in mass) on the y-axis and t
