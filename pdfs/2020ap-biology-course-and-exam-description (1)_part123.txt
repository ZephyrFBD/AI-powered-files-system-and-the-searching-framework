ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
c. 
The transfer of electrons is accompanied by 
the formation of a proton gradient across 
the inner mitochondrial membrane or the 
internal membrane of chloroplasts, with 
the membrane(s) separating a region of 
high proton concentration from a region of 
low proton concentration. In prokaryotes, 
the passage of electrons is accompanied 
by
