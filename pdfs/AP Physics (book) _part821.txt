This short lever
arm 
and the corresponding smaller torque associated with 
are consistent
with the observation that 
is less effective in accelerating the door than is 
with its larger lever arm. When the lever arm is defined in this way, experiment
shows that the relation
is valid in general. Notice in Fig. 8–12 that the line
of action of the force 
passes through the hinge, and hence its lever arm is zero.
Consequently, zero torque is associated with 
and it gives rise to no angular
acceleration, in accord with everyday experience (you can’t get a door to start
moving by pushing directly at the hinge).
In general, then, we can write the magnitude of the torque about a given axis as
(8;10a)

is the lever arm, and the perpendicular symbol 
reminds us that
