of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the 
 
 men need the chairs.The men sit because they’re worn out from walking 
 
 to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, 
 
 discussing the world’s problems and wondering what to do with the rest 
 
 of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a 
 
 shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie 
 
 Library reading English and Irish newspapers.A man on the dole needs 
 
 to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts 
 
 on what’s going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in 
 
 case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible 
 
 state of the Chinese millions.A man on the dole goes home after 
 
 a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge 
 
 him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea 
 
 and time to sit in his chair and think of the world. 
 
 Easter is bet
