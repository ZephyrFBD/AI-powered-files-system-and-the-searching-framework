he total number 
of atomic orbitals on an atom remains constant, so the number of hybrid orbitals on an 
atom equals the number of atomic orbitals that are mixed.
As we examine the common types of hybridization, notice the connection between 
the type of hybridization and some of the molecular geometries predicted by the VSEPR 
model: linear, bent, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral.
