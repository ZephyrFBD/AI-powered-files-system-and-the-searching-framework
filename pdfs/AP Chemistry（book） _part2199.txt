Equation 
14.7 with k = 2.7 * 10-4 M-1 s-1, m = 1, and n = 1, we can calculate the rate for 
3NH4
+4 = 0.100 M and 3NO2
-4 = 0.100 M:
 Rate = 12.7 * 10-4M-1 s-1210.100 M210.100 M2 = 2.7 * 10-6M>s 
Give It Some Thought
Does the rate constant have the same units as the rate?
Reaction Orders: The Exponents in the Rate Law

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
The exponents m and n are called reaction orders. For example, consider again 
the rate law for the reaction of NH4
+ with NO2
-:
 
Rate = k3NH4
+43NO2
-4 
Because the exponent of 3NH4
+4 is 1, the rate is first order in NH4
+. The rate is also first 
order in NO2
-. (The exponent 1 is not shown in rate laws.) The overall reaction order 
is the sum of the orders with respect to each reactant represented in the rate law. Thus, 
for the reaction between NH4
+ and NO2
-  the rate law has an overall
