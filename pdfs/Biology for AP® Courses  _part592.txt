entrations of Na+ and K+) in living cells. The
sodium-potassium pump moves K+ into the cell while moving Na+ out at the same time, at a ratio of three
Na+ for every two K+ ions moved in. The Na+-K+ ATPase exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to
the interior or exterior of the cell and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions. The process consists of
the following six steps:
1.
With the enzyme oriented towards the interior of the cell, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions.
Three ions bind to the protein.
2.
The protein carrier hydrolyzes ATP and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.
3.
As a result, the carrier changes shape and re-orients itself towards the exterior of the membrane. The
protein’s affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.
4.
The shape change increases the carrier’s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the
protein. Subsequently, the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carr
