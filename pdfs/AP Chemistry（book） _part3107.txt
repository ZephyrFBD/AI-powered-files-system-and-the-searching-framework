ferent gases occupy the two bulbs shown here. 
Consider the process that occurs when the stopcock is 
opened, assuming the gases behave ideally. (a) Draw the 
final (equilibrium) state. (b) Predict the signs of ∆H and 
∆S for the process. (c) Is the process that occurs when the 
stopcock is opened a reversible one? (d) How does the pro-
cess affect the entropy of the surroundings? [Sections 19.1 
and 19.2]
 
19.3  (a) What are the signs of ∆S and ∆H for the process depicted 
here? (b) If energy can flow in and out of the system to 
maintain a constant temperature during the process, what 
can you say about the entropy change of the surroundings 
as a result of this process? [Sections 19.2 and 19.5]
 
19.2  As shown here, one type of computer keyboard cleaner 
contains liquefied 1,1-difluoroethane 1C2H4F22, which 
is a gas at atmospheric pressure. When the nozzle is 
squeezed, the 1,1-difluoroethane vaporizes out of the 
nozzle at high pressure, blowing dust out of objects.
