s to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points.
The nematode C.elegans has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during
their development in the nematode life cycle. There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike
in mammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.
In vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system. The ectoderm forms
epithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues. During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules
called growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. The remaining cells in the
center form the neural plate. If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate
into neural tissue.
The neural plate undergoes a series of ce
