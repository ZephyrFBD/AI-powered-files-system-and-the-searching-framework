ther offer variations of the floating disk technique or used the 
technique to provide evidence for research. All offer good ideas that can be adapted 
for student research. Try to obtain a copy of the Wickliff and Chasson (1964) paper. It 
is the earliest paper of which this author is aware that describes this technique, and it 
is perhaps the best. There are many ideas that can lead to good student projects.
