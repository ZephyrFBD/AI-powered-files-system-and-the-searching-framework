 called coenzymes or inorganic molecules or ions. Inorganic cofactors are usually metal
ions (Fe2+, Mg2+). Vitamins are examples of organic coenzymes. Your daily dose of vitamins is important for just
this reason: vitamins are active and necessary participants in crucial chemical reactions.
Factors Affecting Reaction Rates
Enzymatic reactions can be influenced by a number of factors, such as temperature and pH. The concentrations of
enzyme and substrate will also determine the speed of the reaction.
Temperature
The rate of a reaction increases with increasing temperature, up to a point, because an increase in the temperature of
a reaction increases the chance of collisions among the molecules. But too much heat can damage an enzyme. If a
reaction is conducted at an excessively high temperature (above 42Â°C), the enzyme loses its three-dimensional shape
and becomes inactivated. Enzymes damaged by heat and deprived of their ability to catalyze reactions are said to be
denatured. In some c
