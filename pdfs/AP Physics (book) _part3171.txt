y X-rays are generally for the 
line (see
Fig. 28–11) which occurs when high-energy electrons knock out K shell elec-
trons (the innermost orbit,
) and their place is taken by electrons from
the L shell 
We use the Bohr model, and assume the electrons of the
unknown atoms (Z) “see” a nuclear charge of
(screened by one electron).
SOLUTION
The hydrogen transition 
to 
would yield
(see Fig. 27–29 or Example 27–13). Energy
of our unknown 
is proportional to 
(Eq. 27–15), or rather 
because the nucleus is shielded by the one electron in a 1s state (see above), so
we can use ratios:
so
and
which makes it lead.
Now we briefly analyze the continuous part of an X-ray spectrum
(Fig. 28–11) based on the photon theory of light. When electrons strike the
target, they collide with atoms of the material and give up most of their energy as
heat (about 99%, so X-ray tubes must be cooled). Electrons can also give up
energy by emitting a photon of light: an electron decelerated by interaction with
atoms
