ruit flies, gray (g+) body color is dominant to black body color (g). Normal wings
(w+) are dominant to dumpy wings (w).
Cross a double heterozygote to a double recessive (g+g w+w x ggww).
Expected phenotypes of 1,000 offspring would be:
250 wild type (gray normal)/parental phenotype
250 black dumpy/parental phenotype
250 gray dumpy/recombinant phenotype
250 black normal/recombinant phenotype
Observed phenotypes of 1,000 offspring were:
450 wild type (gray normal) /parental phenotype
450 black dumpy/parental phenotype
50 gray dumpy/recombinant phenotype
50 black normal/recombinant phenotype
The high number of observed parental phenotypes indicated that the genes for body color and
wings were linked to each other. Linked genes are on the same chromosome and are very close to
each other. Linked genes are inherited together and recombination between the genes is very low.
Calculation of Recombination Frequency or the measure of genetic linkage between 2 genes (also
called map units).
