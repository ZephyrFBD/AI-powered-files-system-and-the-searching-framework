ment.
(C) Over half of known amino acids involved in life were detected in the mixture during the experiment.
(D) Basic sugar molecules were generated and detected in the mixture during the experiment.
5. Some amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, could not be formed in this experiment. Which of the
following best explains why these molecules could not be detected?
Figure 1. Cysteine
(A) The chemical reactions necessary to create amino acids such as cysteine and methionine require more
energy than the simulated lightning provided in the experiment.
(B) The chemical reactions necessary to create amino acids such as cysteine and methionine require enzymes
for catalysis to occur, which were not included in the experiment.
(C) Sulfur-based compounds were not included in the experiment.
(D) Nitrogen-based compounds were not included in the experiment.
6. A scientist believes that the Miller-Urey experiment failed to yield the remaining amino acids and the nucleic
acids because of th
