transformation procedure, the contents of the tubes are plated on agar plates, as described in the table.
Plate
Description
A
Agar in plate contains LB; 100 microliters from Tube 1 are placed on this plate.
B
Agar in plate contains LB and streptomycin; 100 microliters from Tube 1 are placed on
this plate.
C
Agar in plate contains LB; 100 microliters from Tube 2 are placed on this plate.
D
Agar in plate contains LB with streptomycin; 100 microliters from Tube 2 are placed on
this plate.
5. On which plate would you expect to see the least amount of bacterial growth after incubation for 24 hours?
(A) Plate A, because the agar in the plate does not contain any streptomycin
(B) Plate B, because only a small percentage of the E. coli will absorb the plasmid
(C) Plate C, because Tube 2 did not contain the plasmid
(D) Plate D, because Tube 2 did not contain the plasmid, and streptomycin will kill the E. coli
6. What is the most likely explanation for the presence of bacterial colonies on Plate
