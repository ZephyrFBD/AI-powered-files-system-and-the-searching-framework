Nuclear Reactors
Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to generate energy. The core of a typical nuclear 
reactor consists of four principal components: fuel elements, control rods, a moder-
ator, and a primary coolant (Figure 21.19). The fuel is a fissionable substance, such as 
uranium-235. The natural isotopic abundance of uranium-235 is only 0.7%, too low to 
sustain a chain reaction in most reactors. Therefore, the 235U content of the fuel must be

enriched to 3â€“5% for use in a reactor. The fuel elements contain enriched uranium in the 
form of UO2 pellets encased in zirconium or stainless steel tubes.
The control rods are composed of materials that absorb neutrons, such as boron-10 or 
an alloy of silver, indium, and cadmium. These rods regulate the flux of neutrons to keep 
the reaction chain self-sustaining and also prevent the reactor core from overheating.*
The probability that a neutron will trigger fission of a 235U nucleus depends on t
