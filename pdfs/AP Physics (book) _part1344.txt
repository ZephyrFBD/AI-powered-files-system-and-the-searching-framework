Summary
15. Is there a Doppler shift if the source and observer move in
the same direction, with the same velocity? Explain.
16. If a wind is blowing, will this alter the frequency of the
sound heard by a person at rest with respect to the source?
Is the wavelength or velocity changed?
17. Figure 12–32 shows various positions of a child on a swing
moving toward a person on the ground who is blowing a
whistle. At which position, A through E, will the child hear
the highest frequency for the sound of the whistle? Explain
your reasoning.

CHAPTER 12
Sound
1. What is the evidence that sound travels as a wave?
2. What is the evidence that sound is a form of energy?
3. Children sometimes play with a homemade “telephone” by
attaching a string to the bottoms of two paper cups. When
the string is stretched and a child speaks into one cup
