a disproportionally large effect on many other species in the ecosystem, so
it is a keystone species. Choice (A) is incorrect because an apex predator consumes other organisms and has no
predators itself, and the wildebeest is a primary consumer because it eats grass. Producers (such as grass)
perform photosynthesis, so choice (C) is incorrect. Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, not producers.
So the wildebeest is not a secondary consumer, and choice (D) is incorrect.
37. (C) Bacteria do not have nuclei but do have cell membranes and cell walls. Choice (A) is incorrect because
bacteria do not have nuclei, mitochondria, or chloroplasts. Bacteria do not have nuclei or mitochondria, so
choices (B) and (D) are incorrect.
38. (A) Plants depend on pollinators for reproduction, and plants have chloroplasts. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are
incorrect because they do not have chloroplasts.
39. (B) Human muscle tissue would have nuclei and mitochondria but not chloroplasts or cell walls. Ch
