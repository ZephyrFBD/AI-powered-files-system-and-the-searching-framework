■ Enduring Understandings 
•  ENE-3: Timing and coordination of biological mechanisms involved in growth, 
reproduction, and homeostasis depend on organisms responding to environmental cues. 
•  IST-5: Transmission of information results in changes within and between biological 
systems. 
•  SYI-1: Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact. 
■ Learning Objectives 
•  IST-5.A: Explain how the behavioral responses of organisms affect their overall fitness 
and may contribute to the success of the population. 
•  ENE-3.D: Explain how the behavioral and/or physiological response of an organism is 
related to changes in internal or external environment. 
•  SYI-1.H: Explain how
