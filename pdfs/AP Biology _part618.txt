nd ethylene gas are
examples of plant hormones.
AUXINS
An unequal distribution of auxins is responsible for phototropisms.
They enhance apical dominance, which is the preferential growth of
a plant upward (toward the sun) rather than laterally.
Auxins are the main ingredient in rooting powder, which helps
develop roots quickly.
CYTOKININS
Cytokinins stimulate cytokinesis and cell division.
They delay senescence (aging) by inhibiting protein breakdown.
Spraying cytokinins on flowers keeps them fresh.
GIBBERELLINS
Gibberellins promote stem and leak elongation.
They induce “bolting,” the rapid growth of a floral stalk on which a
flower and fruit will develop.
ABSCISIC ACID (ABA)
ABA inhibits growth and promotes seed dormancy.
It enables plants to withstand drought.
It closes stomates during times of water stress.
ETHYLENE GAS
Ethylene gas promotes ripening, which in turn triggers increased
