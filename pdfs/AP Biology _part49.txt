Regulation: Hormones such as insulin lower blood sugar
Enzymatic activity: Catalyzing chemical reactions
Movement: Actin and myosin are protein fibers that are responsible
for muscle contractions
Dietary sources of proteins include fish, poultry, meat, and certain
plants like beans and peanuts. One gram of protein burned in a calorimeter
releases 4 calories. Proteins consist of the elements S, P, C, O, H, and N.
They are polymers or polypeptides consisting of units called amino
acids, which are joined by peptide bonds.
Amino acids consist of a carboxyl group, an amine group, and a
variable (R) all attached to a central asymmetric carbon atom. The R
group, also called the side chain or variable, differs with each amino acid.
The R groups are categorized by their chemical properties: hydrophobic,
hydrophilic, acidic, or basic. The interactions among these R groups
ultimately determine the overall structure and function of a protein. With
