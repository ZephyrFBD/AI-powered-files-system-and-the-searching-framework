In a p-type semiconductor, a small percentage of semiconductor atoms are
replaced by atoms with three outer electrons (group III in the Periodic Table),
such as boron. As shown in Fig. 29–27a, there is a hole in the lattice structure
near a boron atom because it has only three outer electrons. Electrons from
nearby silicon atoms can jump into this hole and fill it. But this leaves a hole
where that electron had previously been, Fig. 29–27b. The vast majority of atoms
are silicon, so holes are almost always next to a silicon atom. Since silicon atoms
require four outer electrons to be neutral, this means there is a net positive charge
at the hole. Whenever an electron moves to fill a hole, the positive hole is then at
the previous position of that electron. Another electron can then fill this hole, and
the hole thus moves to a new location; and so on. This type of semiconductor is
called p-type because it is the positive holes that carry the electric current.† Note,
however, that
