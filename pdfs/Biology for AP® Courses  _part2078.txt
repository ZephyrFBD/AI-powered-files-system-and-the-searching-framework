at dinosaurs originated about 200 to
250 million years ago. Would you expect the geographic
distribution of early dinosaur fossils to be broad (on many
continents) or narrow (on one or a few continents)?
Explain.
a.
broad because dinosaurs originated before the
breakup of Pangaea
b.
broad because some dinosaurs could fly between
continents
c.
narrow because they went extinct too quickly to
disperse very far
d.
narrow because they lived so long ago that the
fossils have mostly broken down or disappeared

smallest scale: the change in allele frequencies in a
population over generations. DDT is a pesticide that was
widely in use in the United States from the 1940s until
1972. The table below summarizes a particular allele
frequency in laboratory strains of the common fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster.
