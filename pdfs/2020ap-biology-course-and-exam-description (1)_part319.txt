Figure 1. Formation of a platelet plug in a damaged blood vessel wall
14.	 Which of the following best explains the feedback mechanism illustrated in 
Figure 1?
(A)	This is an example of positive feedback, because the few platelets that 
initially bind attract more platelets to the damaged area.
(B)	 This is an example of positive feedback, because it results from the 
interactions among collagen, endothelial cells, and platelets.
(C)	 This is an example of negative feedback, because a large clump of platelets 
can block the blood vessel and prevent blood flow through it.
(D)	This is an example of negative feedback, because the accumulation of 
platelets returns the open blood vessel wall to a closed state.
15.	 It is estimated that oxygen production first evolved in
