CH4 as the overlap of four equivalent sp3 hybrid 
orbitals on C with the 1s orbitals of the four H atoms to form four equivalent bonds.
Give It Some Thought
In an sp2 hybridized atom, we saw that there was one unhybridized 2p orbital. How 
many unhybridized 2p orbitals remain on an atom that has sp3 hybrid orbitals?
The idea of hybridization is also used to describe the bonding in molecules containing 
nonbonding pairs of electrons. In H2O, for example, the electron-domain geometry around 
the central O atom is approximately tetrahedral (Figure 9.18). Thus, the four electron pairs 
can be envisioned as occupying sp3 hybrid orbitals. Two of the hybrid orbitals contain non-
bonding pairs of electrons, and the other two form bonds with the hydrogen atoms.
