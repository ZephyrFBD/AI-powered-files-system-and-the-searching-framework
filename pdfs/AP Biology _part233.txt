s first, followed by PS I. PS I absorbs light best
in the 700 nm range; hence, it is also called P700. PS II absorbs light best
in the 680 nm range; hence, it is also called P680.

LIGHT-DEPENDENT REACTIONS—THE LIGHT
REACTIONS
Light is absorbed by the photosystems (PS II and PS I) in the thylakoid
membranes and electrons flow through electron transport chains. As
shown in Figure 7.5, there are two possible routes for electron flow:
noncyclic flow (Figure 7.5) and cyclic photophosphorylation (Figure
7.7).
Figure 7.5 Noncyclic Photophosphorylation
Noncyclic Photophosphorylation
During noncyclic photophosphorylation, electrons enter two electron
transport chains. The products are ATP and NADPH (nicotinamide
dinucleotide phosphate). The process begins in PS II and proceeds through
the following steps.
REMEMBER
Electrons flow from water to P680 to P700 to NADP, which carries them to the Calvin cycle.
