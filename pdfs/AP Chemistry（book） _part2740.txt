Equivalence point
Equivalence point
Good choice. Suitable indicator for titration of a 
weak acid with a strong base because equivalence 
point falls within the color-change interval
Poor choice. Unsatisfactory indicator for titration of a 
weak acid with a strong base because color  
changes before reaching equivalence point

CHAPTER 17 Additional Aspects of Aqueous Equilibria
Titrations of Polyprotic Acids
When weak acids contain more than one ionizable H atom, the reaction with OH- occurs 
in a series of steps. Neutralization of phosphorous acid, H3PO3, for example, proceeds in 
two steps (the third H is bonded to
