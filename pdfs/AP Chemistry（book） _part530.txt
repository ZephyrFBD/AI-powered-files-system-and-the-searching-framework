bile travels 225 mi with a gas mileage of 20.5 
mi/gal, how many kilograms of CO2 are produced? Assume 
that the gasoline is composed of octane, C8H181l2, whose 
density is 0.692 g>mL. (b) Repeat the calculation for a truck 
that has a gas mileage of 5 mi/gal.

Section 2.9 introduced the idea of structural isomerism, 
with 1-propanol and 2-propanol as examples. Determine 
which of these properties would distinguish these two sub-
stances: (a) boiling point, (b) combustion analysis results, 
(c) molecular weight, (d) density at a given temperature and 
pressure. You can check on the properties of these two com-
pounds in Wolfram Alpha (http://www.wolframalpha.com/) 
or the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.
 3.112 A particular coal contains 2.5% sulfur by mass. When this 
coal is burned at a power plant, the sulfur is converted into 
sulfur dioxide gas, which is a pollutant. To reduce sulfur 
 
dioxide emissions, calcium oxide (lime) is used. The  
sulfur 
 
dioxide reacts
