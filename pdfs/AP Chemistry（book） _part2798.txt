hlorides. When HCl is added to a mixture of cations, 
therefore, only AgCl, Hg2Cl2, and PbCl2 precipitate, leaving the other cations in solu-
tion. The absence of a precipitate indicates that the starting solution contains no 
Ag+1aq2, Hg2
2 +1aq2, or Pb2 +1aq2.
Group 2. Acid-insoluble sulfides: After any insoluble chlorides have been removed, the 
remaining solution, now acidic from HCl treatment, is treated with H2S. Since H2S is a 
weak acid compared to HCl, its role here is to act as a source for small amounts of sul-
ﬁde. Only the most insoluble metal sulﬁdes—CuS, Bi2S3, CdS, PbS, HgS, As2S3, Sb2S3, 
and SnS2—precipitate. (Note the very small values of Ksp for some of these sulﬁdes in 
Appendix D.) Those metal ions whose sulﬁdes are somewhat more soluble—for exam-
ple, ZnS or NiS—remain in solution.
Group 3. Base-insoluble sulfides and hydroxides: After the solution is ﬁltered to remove 
any acid-insoluble sulﬁdes, it is made slightly basic, and 1NH422S is added. In basic 
solutio
