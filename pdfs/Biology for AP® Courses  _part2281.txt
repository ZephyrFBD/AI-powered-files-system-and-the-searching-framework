ne from the host as it was internalized. This mechanism has also been used to explain the double membranes
found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Lake’s work is not without skepticism, and the ideas are still debated within the
biological science community. In addition to Lake’s hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin
of eukaryotes. How did the eukaryotic nucleus evolve? One theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional
membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome. Some bacteria have the DNA enclosed by two membranes; however,
there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores. Other proteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes. If the
eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of the two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to
eukaryotes.
Figure 20.15 The theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts are endosymbiotic in origin is now widely accepted. More
controversial is the proposal that (a) the eukar
