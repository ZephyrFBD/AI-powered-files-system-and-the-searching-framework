arge polar molecules (such as glucose) and all ions are
impermeable. 2. Proteins in the plasma membrane provide a wide range of functions and include the following:
 
Channel proteins provide open passageways through the membrane for certain hydrophilic (water-soluble)
substances such as polar and charged molecules. Aquaporins are channel proteins of certain cells (such as those
found in kidneys and plant roots)
that dramatically increase the passage rate of H2O molecules.
 
Ion channels allow the passage of ions across the membrane. In nerve and muscle cells, ion channels called gated
channels open and close in response to specific chemical or electrical stimuli to
allow the passage of specific ions (such as Na+ and K+).
 
Carrier proteins bind to specific molecules, which are then transferred across the membrane after the carrier
protein undergoes a change of shape. The passage of glucose into a cell is by a carrier protein.
Transport proteins use energy (in the form of ATP, adenosin
