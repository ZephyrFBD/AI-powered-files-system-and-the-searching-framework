are smaller (70S, with 50S and 30S subunits) than those of eukaryotes (80S, with 60S and
40S subunits).
4. The cell walls of bacteria, when present, are constructed from peptidoglycans, a polysaccharide-protein molecule.
The cell walls of archaea are chemically diverse and may contain proteins, glycoproteins, and/or polysaccharides,
but not peptidoglycans, cellulose (as in plants), or chitin (as in fungi).
5. Flagella, when present in prokaryotes, are not constructed of microtubules and are not enclosed by the plasma
membrane. The flagella deliver motion by twisting like a screw.
Movement of Substances
Various terms are used to describe the movement of substances between cells and into and out of a cell. These terms
differ in the following respects:
1. The movement of substances may occur across a selectively permeable membrane (such as the plasma
membrane). A selectively permeable membrane allows only specific substances to pass.
2. The substance whose movement is being described may
