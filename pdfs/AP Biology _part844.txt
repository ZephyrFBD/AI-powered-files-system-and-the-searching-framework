ty, they pass through different
developmental stages called instars. Use larvae that are already well along
their 4th or 5th instar stage.
CONVERT BIOMASS MEASUREMENTS (GRAMS) TO
ENERGY UNITS IN KILOCALORIES
For Wisconsin Fast Plants, assume that 1 gram (g) of dried biomass
contains 4.35 kilocalories (kcal) of energy. Assume that the biomass of
4th-instar larvae is 40% of the wet mass.
Calculate the biomass of the larvae. For butterfly larvae, use an average
value of 5.5 kcal/g of biomass to calculate the energy of each larva.
To determine the energy content in the larval frass (droppings), use 4.76
kcal of energy/g of frass. Calculate the frass lost per individual larva.
To determine the energy content of the brussels sprouts eaten by each
larva, convert the wet mass of the sprout to dry mass and multiply by 4.35
kcal/g.
Use the estimated percentage of biomass (dry mass) in fresh Wisconsin
Fast Plants that you previously calculated.
