ergy in a variety of ways, which is transferred between trophic levels as the energy
flows from the bottom to the top of the food web, with energy being lost at each transfer. The efficiency of these transfers
is important for understanding the different behaviors and eating habits of warm-blooded versus cold-blooded animals.
Modeling of ecosystem energy is best done with ecological pyramids of energy, although other ecological pyramids
provide other vital information about ecosystem structure.
37.3 Biogeochemical Cycles
Mineral nutrients are cycled through ecosystems and their environment. Of particular importance are water, carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. All of these cycles have major impacts on ecosystem structure and function. As human
activities have caused major disturbances to these cycles, their study and modeling is especially important. A variety of
