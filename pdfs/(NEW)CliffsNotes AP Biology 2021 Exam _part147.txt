 membranes create an intermembrane space between them,
 
where H+ (protons), transported from the matrix, accumulate. This
creates a proton gradient, which drives the movement of protons thru ATP synthase back into the matrix. As protons
pass through the ATP synthase channel, ATP is generated from ADP and Pi.
Some Typical Answers to Long Questions
Question 1
a. The Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are the oxygenrequiring processes involved in obtaining ATP
from pyruvate. Pyruvate is derived from glucose through glycolysis, a process that does not require oxygen.
Before pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle, it combines with coenzyme A.
 
During this initial reaction with coenzyme A, 2 electrons and 2 H+ removed from pyruvate combine with NAD+ to
form 1 NADH + H+.
 
NADH is a coenzyme storing enough energy to generate 3 ATP in
 
oxidative phosphorylation. A CO2 molecule is also released. The end
product of this reaction is acetyl CoA. To begin the Krebs cycle, acetyl CoA combines wit
