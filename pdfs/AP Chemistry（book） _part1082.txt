the lengths of bonds involving hydrogen show larger  
deviations 
from the values predicted from bonding atomic radii than do 
bonds involving larger atoms.)
Comment Notice that our estimated bond lengths are close but 
not exact matches to the measured bond lengths. Bonding

▶Practice Exercise 1
Hypothetical elements X and Y form a molecule XY
2, in 
which both Y atoms are bonded to atom X (and not to one 
another). The X—X distance in the elemental form of X is 
2.04 Å, and the Y—Y distance in elemental Y is 1.68 Å. What 
would you predict for the X—Y distance in the XY
2 molecule?
(a) 0.84 Å (b) 1.02 Å (c) 1.86 Å (d) 2.70 Å  (e) 3.72 Å
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Using Figure 7.7, predict which is longer, the P¬Br bond in 
PBr3 or the As¬Cl bond in AsCl3.
atomic radii must be used with some caution in estimating 
bond lengths.
