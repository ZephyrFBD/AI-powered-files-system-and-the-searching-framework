e carrying a current that is moving directly
away from you? Explain.
4. A horseshoe magnet is held vertically with the north pole on
the left and south pole on the right. A wire passing between
the poles, equidistant from them, carries a current directly
away from you. In what direction is the force on the wire?
Explain.
5. Will a magnet attract any metallic object, such as those made
of aluminum or copper? (Try it and see.) Why is this so?
6. Two iron bars attract each other no matter which ends are
placed close together. Are both magnets? Explain.
7. The magnetic field due to current in wires in your home
can affect a compass. Discuss the effect in terms of currents,
including if they are ac or dc.
8. If a negatively charged particle enters a region of uniform
magnetic field which is perpendicular to the particleâ€™s
velocity, will the kinetic energy of the particle increase,
decrease, or stay the same? Explain your answer. (Neglect
gravity and assume there is no electric field.)
