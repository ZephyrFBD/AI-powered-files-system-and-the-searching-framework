ommunity of native vegetation. Sand and silt (carried in by a river) and decomposed vegetation
contribute to the filling of the lake. Submerged vegetation is established first, followed by emergent vegetation
whose leaves may cover the water surface. Grasses, sedges, rushes, and cattails take root at the perimeter of the lake.
Eventually, the lake fills with sediment and vegetation and is subsequently replaced by a meadow of grasses and
herbs. In many mountain regions, the meadow is replaced by shrubs and native trees, eventually becoming a part of
the surrounding coniferous forest.
The Flow of Energy in Ecosystems
On average, only about 1% of the solar energy that reaches the surface of the earth is converted into organic matter.
How that energy gets distributed to all the living things in an ecosystem helps us understand how ecosystems work.
Two types of flow charts demonstrate how energy flows through an ecosystem, showing who eats whom. The
arrows used in these flow charts indicate
