 to differentiate among pathways of information transmission within the nervous 
system. Students were then asked to describe differences between a reflex arc and a typical stimulus-
response pathway, based on their analysis of the representation. Students were then asked to support the 
claim that reflex arcs are beneficial to organismal survival. 
How well did students perform on this question? 
The mean score for this question was 1.28 out of a possible 3 points.

What were common student errors or omissions?  
Most students successfully described at least one difference between a reflex arc and a typical stimulus-
response pathway. However, many students incorrectly claimed that without a reflex, organisms will not 
respond to any stimulus. Students often confused neural pathways with signal transduction pathways or 
with hormone signaling, and some students described neuron function (resting p
