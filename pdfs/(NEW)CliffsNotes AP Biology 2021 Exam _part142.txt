b. Explain, at the molecular level, how some organisms can sustain life in the absence of oxygen.
Answers and Explanations
Multiple-Choice Questions
1. D. In the absence of oxygen, all of the NAD+ gets converted to NADH. With no NAD+ to accept electrons from
the glycolytic steps, glycolysis stops. By replenishing NAD+, alcohol fermentation allows
glycolysis to continue.
 
2. A. At the end of the electron transport chain in oxidative
 
phosphorylation, Â½ O2 combines with 2 electrons and 2 H+ to form
 
water.
 
3. D. You should review aerobic respiration by identifying each arrow: Pathway A is glycolysis; Pathway B is the
Krebs cycle; and Pathway C
 
is oxidative phosphorylation. Arrow 1: ADP or NAD+; arrow 2: pyruvate; arrow 3: NADH; arrow 4: ATP; arrow 5:
ADP, NAD+, or
FAD; arrows 6 and 7: FADH2 and NADH (either one can be6or 7); arrow 8: ATP or CO2; arrows 9 and 10: O2 and
ADP (either one can be 9 or 10); and arrows 11 and 12: H2O and ATP (either one can be 11 or
12).
 
4. B. ATP is p
