E. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome
(as do most prokaryotes), it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of replication is
recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen
bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped
structures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get
extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds. Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the
replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix. DNA polymerase is able to add
nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction). It also requires a free
3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester
