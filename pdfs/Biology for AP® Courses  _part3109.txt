nd digest.” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the
parasympathetic nervous system is in control (“picnic” and “parasympathetic” both start with “p”). Parasympathetic
preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord, as shown
in Figure 26.27. The axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons, which are
generally located very near the target organs. Most postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs, although
some release nitric oxide.
The parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated (the common
adrenaline dump you feel after a ‘fight-or-flight’ event). Effects of acetylcholine release on target organs include slowing of
heart rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.
