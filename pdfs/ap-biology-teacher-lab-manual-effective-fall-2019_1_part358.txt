A particularly effective method of assessment involves the use of peer-reviewed

The advantage of peer-review is that revisions can be encouraged before a grade is 
determined. 
For this investigation the mini-poster has proven to be a very effective tool to evaluate 
individual or group work. The following are suggested as guidelines to assess students’

develop your own methods of postlab assessment: 
1. Revisit the learning objectives. Based on students’ answers to the analysis questions, 
do you think students have met the objectives of the laboratory investigation? 
2. Have students develop a list of common misconcep
