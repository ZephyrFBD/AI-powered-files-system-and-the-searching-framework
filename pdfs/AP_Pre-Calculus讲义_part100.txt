3.11.3 Polar Equations 
When we use these equations to find the polar coordinates of a point, we must be careful 
that the values we choose for r and  give us a point in the correct quadrant. 
 
Example 3 
Express the equation x2 =4y in polar coordinates. 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 4 
Express the polar equation in rectangular coordinates. If possible, determine the graph of 
the equation from its rectangular form.
