They hypothesize that bacteria secrete the toxin only when the
population reaches a certain cell density and that they coordinate
expression of the protein through quorum sensing mediated by a
diﬀusible inducer molecule.
Which of the following experiments would most eﬀectively test
their hypothesis?
Resuspend cells in the late stationary phase of growth in the
supernatant conditioned by cells in early stages of growth.
(A)
Resuspend cells from the early stages of growth in the
supernatant conditioned by cells in the late phase of growth.
(B)
Resuspend cells in the late phase of growth in fresh medium.
(C)
Resuspend cells from the early stages of growth in fresh
medium.

3. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are found mostly as monomers
but also as dimers in the membrane. Signal transduction inside
the cell is activated when the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain
of the receptor is modified with four phosphate groups.
