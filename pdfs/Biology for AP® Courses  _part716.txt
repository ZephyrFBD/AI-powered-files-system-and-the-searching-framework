s, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple “lock-and-key” fashion. This model
asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports
a more refined view called induced fit (Figure 6.16). The induced-fit model expands upon the lock-and-key model by
describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their
interaction causes a mild shift in the enzyme’s structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme
and the transition state of the substrate. This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme’s ability to catalyze its reaction.

Phosphofructokinase deficiency occurs when a person lacks an enzyme needed to perform glycolysis in skeletal
muscles. What effect could this have on the body?
