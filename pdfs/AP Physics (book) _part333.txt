est, or of uniform velocity in a straight
line, as long as no net force acts on it.
The tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or of uniform velocity in a
straight line is called inertia. As a result, Newton’s first law is often called the 
law of inertia.

developing mechanics, including his
three great laws of motion and the law
of universal gravitation, he also tried
to understand the nature of light.

Newton’s first law. A school bus comes 
to a sudden stop, and all of the backpacks on the floor start to slide forward.
What force causes them to do that?
RESPONSE It isn’t “force” that does it. By Newton’s first law, the backpacks
continue their state of motion, maintaining their velocity. The backpacks slow
down if a force is applied, such as
