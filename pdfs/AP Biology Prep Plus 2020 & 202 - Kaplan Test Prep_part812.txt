7. Scientists are interested in understanding how climate change
can aﬀect forest biomass. The figures below show the amount of
above-ground biomass at three forest locations, with dates on the
x-axis, growth rate on the y-axis, and a dotted line representing no
net change in biomass.
Which of the following conclusions can most reasonably be drawn
from the results?

There is an increase in biomass growth rate in these
locations. This data may be specific for the study locations
and may not be generalizable.

There is no change or a slight decrease in biomass growth
rate in these locations. This data may be specific for the study
locations and may not
