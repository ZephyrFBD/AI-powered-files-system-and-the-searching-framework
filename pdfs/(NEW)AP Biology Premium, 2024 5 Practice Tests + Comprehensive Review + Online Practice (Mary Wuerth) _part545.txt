ide and would perform less photosynthesis in a 39°C
environment than in a 30°C environment. It would have fewer organic compounds with which to supply
itself with energy. This is because the data show that a C3 plant will consume less carbon dioxide at 40°C
(compared to at 30°C), so it will probably perform less photosynthesis when exposed to heat wave
temperatures.

Overview
Populations are made of individual organisms that interact with one another and with their environment in complex
ways. This chapter reviews the factors that affect the rate of growth of populations and the biodiversity of the
communities in which they live.
Population Ecology
How organisms get the energy and matter they need to survive affects their population sizes and the rate o
