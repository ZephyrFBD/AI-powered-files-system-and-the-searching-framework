the different groups in
the experiment. If one plant is grown in pH 5 and the other in pH 7, then pH is the independent variable.
Dependent Variable: The data, or the thing that you measure during the experiment. The height of the plant
you are growing might be the dependent variable.
Constants (Controlled Variables): The things that are the same between all your groups. Hint: everything
should be constant except the independent variable.
Control Groups: Any group that is needed simply so you can compare your interesting experimental groups to
it. These are often the “no treatment” group.
Statistical Significance: The trustworthiness of the results and the certainty you have in your conclusions. This
can always be increased by including more individuals in the groups or including more trials.
Most biological experiments do one of three things:
1. look at how something changes over time
2. compare groups of some sort
3. test for an association
How you present and summarize data depends
