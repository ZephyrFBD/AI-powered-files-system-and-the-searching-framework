†Recall from Section 13–1 that the word “atom” comes from the Greek meaning “indivisible.” Atoms
have a substructure (protons, neutrons) so are not fundamental. Yet an atom is still the smallest
“piece” of an element that has the characteristics of that material.
any group of particles is quantified using the concept of cross section, Section 31–1.
Because the projectile particles are at high energy, this field is sometimes called
high-energy physics.
Wavelength and Resolution
Particles accelerated to high energy can probe the interior of nuclei and nucleons
or other particles they strike. An important factor is that faster-moving projectiles
can reveal more detail. The wavelength of projectile particles is given by 
de Broglie’s wavelength formula (Eq. 27–8),
(32;1)
showing that the greater the momentum p of the bombarding particle, the shorter
its wavelength. As discussed in Chapter 25 on optical instruments, resolution of
details in images is limited by the wavelength: the s
