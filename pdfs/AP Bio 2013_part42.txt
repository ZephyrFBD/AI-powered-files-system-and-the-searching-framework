In a classic experiment from the 1970s investigating gene expression, a solution containing equal amounts of 
rabbit a-hemoglobin mRNA and b-hemoglobin mRNA, which encode subunits of a protein found in red blood  
cells, was injected into newly fertilized frog eggs. The injected mRNA was not degraded during the course of the 
experiment. Tadpoles that developed from the injected eggs were dissected into two fragments, one containing 
predominantly the notochord, muscle tissue, and nerve tissue and the other containing predominantly the other  
tissue types. 
 
Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed after separation by electrophoresis to identify the relative amounts 
of the different proteins present in each sample. The thickness of the bands indicates the relative amounts of rabbit 
a-hemoglobin, rabbit b-hemoglobin, and frog tubulin (a cytoskeletal protein that is expressed at relatively
