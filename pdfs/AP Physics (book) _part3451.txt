Nuclear Reactors
Several problems have to be overcome to make any nuclear reactor function.
First, the probability that a 
nucleus will absorb a neutron is large only for
slow neutrons, but the neutrons emitted during a fission (which are needed to
sustain a chain reaction) are moving very fast. A substance known as a moderator
must be used to slow down the neutrons. The most effective moderator will
consist of atoms whose mass is as close as possible to that of the neutrons. (To see
why this is true, recall from Chapter 7 that a billiard ball striking an equal mass
ball at rest can itself be stopped in one collision; but a billiard ball striking a
heavy object bounces off with nearly unchanged speed.) The best moderator
would thus contain 
Unfortunately,

the isotope of hydrogen called deuterium,
does not absorb many neutrons
and is thus an almost ideal moderator. Either
