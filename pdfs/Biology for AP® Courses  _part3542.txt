 are held together by fibrous connective tissue; the three types of fibrous joints are sutures, syndesomes, and
gomphoses. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage; the two types of cartilaginous
joints are synchondroses and symphyses. Synovial joints are joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. The
functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. The movement
of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement. Gliding
movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Angular movements are produced when the angle
between the bones of a joint changes. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own
longitudinal axis. Special movements include inversion, eversion, protraction, retraction, elevation, depression,
dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, supination, pronation,
