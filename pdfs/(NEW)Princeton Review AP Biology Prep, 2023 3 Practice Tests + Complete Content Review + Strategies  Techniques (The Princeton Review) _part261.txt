hrough cell signaling. Signaling can be short-range
(affecting only nearby cells) or long-range (affecting cells throughout the organism). It can be done by cell junctions
or signaling molecules called ligands that bind to receptors and trigger a response by changing the shape of the
receptor protein. Hormones and neurotransmitters are common signaling molecules.
Signal transduction is the process by which an external signal is transmitted to the inside of a cell. It usually
involves the following three steps:
1. a signaling molecule binding to a specific receptor
2. activation of a signal transduction pathway
3. production of a cellular response
Hydrophobic signaling molecules, like cholesterol-based steroid hormones, can diffuse across the plasma
membrane. These molecules can bind receptors inside the cell and often travel to the nucleus where they regulate
gene expression.
For signaling molecules that cannot enter the cell, a plasma membrane receptor is required. Plasma membrane
