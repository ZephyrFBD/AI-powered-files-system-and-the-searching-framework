FIGURE 26–8 (a) A spaceship traveling
at very high speed from Earth to the
planet Neptune, as seen from Earth’s
frame of reference. (b) According to an
observer on the spaceship, Earth and
Neptune are moving at the very high
speed v: Earth leaves the spaceship, and
a time 
later Neptune arrives at the
spaceship.

†We assume v is much greater than the relative speed of Neptune and Earth (which we thus ignore).
Observers on Earth watch a spacecraft traveling at speed v from Earth to,
say, Neptune, Fig. 26–8a. The distance between the planets, as measured by the
Earth observers, is 
The time required for the trip, measured from Earth, is

In Fig. 26–8b we see the point of view of observers on t
