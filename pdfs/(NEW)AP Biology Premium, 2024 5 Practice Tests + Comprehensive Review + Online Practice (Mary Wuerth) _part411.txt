rom different source organisms. DNA can be cut at specific sequences using
restriction endonucleases (also known as restriction enzymes), and these pieces of DNA can be recombined and
connected with DNA ligases. Some recombinant plasmids may contain the selectable marker as well as a gene that
codes for a desired protein product. Bacteria that take in the recombinant plasmid would be capable of producing the
product that is coded for by the gene on the plasmid. Many pharmaceutical products (such as insulin) are now
produced in large amounts by bacteria that contain recombinant plasmids. Before the advent of biotechnology, the
insulin needed for patients with diabetes had to be isolated from the pancreas of animals, which was an expensive
process and had the potential of transmitting diseases from other organisms. Now, recombinant insulin made by
transformed bacteria is safer and less expensive than insulin was 50 years ago.
Gel Electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis is a technique that is
