Simple summations like these can be performed for any number of point
charges.
Potential energies. Consider the three
pairs of charges shown in Fig. 17–11. Call them 
and 
(a) Which set has a
positive potential energy? (b) Which set has the most negative potential energy?
(c) Which set requires the most work to separate the charges to infinity? Assume
the charges all have the same magnitude.
RESPONSE The potential energy equals the work required to bring the two
charges near each other, starting at a great distance 
Assume the left 
charge
is already there. To bring a second charge 
close to the first from a great
distance away 
requires external work
where r is the final distance between them. Thus the potential energy of the two
charges is
