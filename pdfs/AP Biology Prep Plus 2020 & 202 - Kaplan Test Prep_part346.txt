sses. This will make the
reaction appear to proceed faster than expected.
(B)
At the start of the reaction, the researchers knew the exact
concentrations of all species in the reaction. As the reaction
proceeded, it would be more diﬀicult to determine exact
concentrations.
(C)
To save time, the researchers measured the initial rate of
reaction so they do not need to wait for the reaction to
progress.
(D)
5. The table shows an experiment that examined the reaction rate of
peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide. Vmax refers to the maximum
velocity of the reaction.

Which of the following would most likely be the maximum
velocity of this reaction at an H2O2 concentration o
