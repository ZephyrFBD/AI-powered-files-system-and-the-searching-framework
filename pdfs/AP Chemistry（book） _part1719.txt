ng points that are much higher 
than expected. In fact, these three compounds also have many other characteristics that dis-
tinguish them from other substances of similar molecular weight and polarity. For example, 
water has a high melting point, a high specific heat, and a high heat of vaporization. Each of 
these properties indicates that the intermolecular forces are abnormally strong.
The strong intermolecular attractions in HF
, H2O, and NH3 result from hydrogen bond-
ing. A hydrogen bond is an attraction between a hydrogen atom attached to a highly electro-
negative atom (usually F, O, or N) and a nearby small electronegative atom in another molecule or 
chemical group. Thus, H¬F, H¬O, or H¬N bonds in one molecule can form hydrogen 
bonds with an F, O, or N atom in another molecule. Several examples of hydrogen bonds 
are shown in Figure 11.10, including the hydrogen bond that exists between the H atom in 
an H2O molecule and the O atom of an adjacent H2O molecule. Notice in ea
