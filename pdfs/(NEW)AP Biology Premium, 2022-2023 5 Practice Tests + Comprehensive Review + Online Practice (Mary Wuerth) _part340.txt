te eyes. Males inherit their only X chromosome from their female parent, so all of the males
have the white-eyed phenotype. The results of the cross are shown in the following figure.
(b) The independent variable is the color of the eyes (or the presence or absence of the TDO2 mutation). The
dependent variable is the mean life span.
(c) There is likely a statistically significant difference if the 95% confidence intervals do NOT overlap. The
lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the mean life span of the white-eyed flies is 37 days (42.8 â€“
5.8). The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the mean life span of the red-eyed flies is 34 days
(29.1 + 4.9). The 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, so there is likely a statistically significant
difference in the life spans of the two groups of flies in this experiment.
(d) In this mating,  of the females would have red eyes,  of the females would have white eyes,  of the
males would have white eyes, and  of the males wou
