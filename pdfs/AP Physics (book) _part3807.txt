y the first few decimal places). This number
is designated by the Greek letter 
It is the constant of proportionality for the
relationship
To obtain an equation, we insert 
into the proportion 
and change the
to 
Thus,
Other kinds of proportionality occur as well. For example, the area of a
circle is proportional to the square of its radius. That is, if the radius is doubled,
the area becomes four times as large; and so on. In this case we can write
where A stands for the area and r for the radius of the circle. The
constant of proportionality is found to be 
again:
Sometimes two quantities are related in such a way that an increase in one
leads to a proportional decrease in the other. This is called inverse proportion.
For example, the time required to travel a given distance is inversely propor-
tional to the speed of travel. The greater the speed, the less time it takes. We can
write this inverse proportion as 
time
The larger the denominator of a fraction, the lower the value of th
