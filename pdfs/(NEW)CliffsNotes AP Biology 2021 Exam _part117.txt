Question 2
You should separate your answer into two distinct parts. The first part should compare prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
that is, describe characteristics they have in common. For example, they both have a plasma membrane, ribosomes,
and DNA. Also, many prokaryotes have a cell wall, a structure they have in common with the eukaryotic cells of
plants and fungi.
In the second part of your answer, contrast prokaryotes and eukaryotes, that is, describe how they are different.
Indicate that the DNA is packaged differently (naked DNA molecules in prokaryotes compared to DNA associated
with proteins in eukaryotes), that prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller than those of eukaryotes, that the prokaryotic
flagella do not contain microtubules, and that prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane and the various eukaryotic
organelles. Also, the cell walls of bacteria contain peptidoglycans, and those of archaea contain other
polysaccharides, but not the cel
