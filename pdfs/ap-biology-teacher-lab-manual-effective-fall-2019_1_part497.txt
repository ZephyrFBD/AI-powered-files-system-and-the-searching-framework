igned to promote competence. An excellent preparation of 
competent cells will yield approximately 108 transformed colonies per microgram of 
plasmid; a poor preparation will yield approximately 104 or less transformed colonies 
per microgram of plasmid.) Students then have the opportunity to design and conduct 
individual experiments to explore transformation in more depth. For example, students 
can select a factor of their choice and explore its ability to induce mutations with 
observable phenotypes, or they can investigate if bacteria take up more plasmid in some 
environmental conditions and less in others. They also can explore answers to questions 
about plasmids and transformation that might have been raised during the initial 
investigation. 
This investigation also provides students with the opportunity to review, connect, and 
apply concepts that they have studied previously, including cell structure of bacteria; 
structure and function of cell membranes, enzymes, and DNA a
