Question 4 
 
Matter continuously cycles through an ecosystem. A simplified carbon cycle is depicted below. 
 
(a) Identify the key metabolic process for step I and the key metabolic process for step II and briefly 
explain how each process promotes movement of carbon through the cycle. For each process, 
your explanation should focus on the role of energy in the movement of carbon. 
 
Identification: 1 point maximum 
I = photosynthesis / Calvin cycle 
AND 
II = (cellular) respiration / citric acid cycle / Krebs cycle 
 
Explanation: 1 point each row; 2 points maximum
