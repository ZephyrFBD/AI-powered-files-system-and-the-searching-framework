the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses leave the infected cells of the
immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the
cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make
it impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive
viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly,
and release (Figure 21.8).
Attachment
A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via
glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines t
