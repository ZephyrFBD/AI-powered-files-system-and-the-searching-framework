otinos and gluinos). Supersymmetry predicts also that a graviton,
which transmits the gravity force, has a partner, the gravitino. Supersymmetry
(often abbreviated SUSY) offers solutions to a number of important theoretical
problems. Supersymmetric particles are a candidate for the “dark matter” of the
universe (discussed in Chapter 33). But why hasn’t this “missing part” of the
universe ever been detected? The best guess is that supersymmetric particles
might be heavier than their conventional counterparts, perhaps too heavy to have
been produced in today’s accelerators. A search for supersymmetric particles 
is already being done at CERN’s new Large Hadron Collider.
Versions of these theories predict other interesting properties, such as that
space has 11 dimensions, but 7 of them are “coiled up” so we normally only notice
the 4-D of space–time. We would like to know if and how many extra dimensions
there are, and how and why they are hidden. We hope to have some answers from
the new
