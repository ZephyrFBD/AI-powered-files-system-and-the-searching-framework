 so much that is begins to solidify. 
Keeping the flask with liquid agar in a water bath at 45–50°C can help prevent the 
agar from cooling too quickly. 
Preprepared nutrient agar also can be purchased. However, it will have to be 
melted before it can be poured into plates. To do this, the plastic bottles containing 
solid agar can be microwaved at a low temperature (such as using the “poultry

Ampicillin is either shipped dry in a small vial or already hydrated. If shipped 
dry, you need to hydrate the ampicillin. Do this by adding 3 mL of transformation 
solution to the vial to rehydrate the antibiotic. Use a sterile p
