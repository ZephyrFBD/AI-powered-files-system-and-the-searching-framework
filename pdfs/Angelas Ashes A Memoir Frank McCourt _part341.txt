 mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on 
 
 cheese and I’d love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in 
 
 me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like 
 
 Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see 
 
 his teeth are white and black and green. 
 
 We eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where 
 
 the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard

 and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home.Me mother’ll 
 
 kill me. I’ll wait for you outside, Frankie. 
 
 Now I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. 
 
 He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can’t pee 
 
 because he’s looking at me and he says,You were fooling.You don’t have 
 
 to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis.That’s all. I wouldn’t want to 
 
 commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation comin
