6.2  A popular kitchen appliance produces electromagnetic radi-
ation with a frequency of 2450 MHz. With reference to Fig-
ure 6.4, answer the following: (a) Estimate the wavelength 
of this radiation. (b) Would the radiation produced by the 
appliance be visible to the human eye? (c) If the radiation 
is not visible, do photons of this radiation have more or less 
energy than photons of visible light? (d) Which of the fol-
lowing is the appliance likely to be? (i) A toaster oven, (ii) A 
microwave oven, or (iii) An electric hotplate. [Section 6.1]
