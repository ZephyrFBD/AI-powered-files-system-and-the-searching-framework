hat this proce-
dure does not imply that H+ ions are involved in the 
chemical reaction. Recall that in aqueous solutions at 
25 °C, Kw = 3H+43OH-4 = 1.0 * 10-14. Thus, 3H+4 is very small in 
this basic solution.

▶Practice Exercise 1
If you complete and balance the following oxidation– 
reduction reaction in basic solution
NO2
-1aq2 + Al1s2 ¡ NH31aq2 + Al1OH24
-1aq2
how many hydroxide ions are there in the balanced equation 
(for the reaction balanced with the smallest whole-number 
coefficients)? 
(a) One on the reactant side (b) One on the product side  
(c) Four on the reactant side (d) Seven on the product side 
(e) None
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Complete and balance the following oxidation–reduction 
reaction in basic solution:
Cr1OH231s2 + ClO-1aq2 ¡ CrO4
2-1aq2 + Cl21g2
CN-1aq2 ¡ CNO-1aq2
MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ MnO21s2
CN-1aq2 + H2O1l2 + 2 OH-1aq2 ¡ CNO-1aq2 + 2 H+1aq2 + 2 e- + 2 OH-1aq2
3 e- + 4 H+1aq2 + MnO4
-1aq2 + 4 OH-1aq2 ¡ MnO21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 + 4 OH-1aq2
CN-1aq2 + H2
