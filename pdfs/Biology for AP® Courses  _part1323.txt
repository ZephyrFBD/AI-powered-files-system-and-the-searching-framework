gotes (LMLN) express both alleles equally. In a self-cross between
heterozygotes expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. However,
the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.
Multiple Alleles
Mendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, could exist for a given gene. We now know that this
is an oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene,
multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when
many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild
animals as the wild type (often abbreviated “+”); this is considered the standard or norm. All other phenotypes or genotypes
are considered variants of this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type. The vari
