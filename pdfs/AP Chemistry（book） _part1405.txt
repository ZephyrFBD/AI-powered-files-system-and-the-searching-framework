espite the fact that it has no obvious relationship to the filling and shapes of 
atomic orbitals. For example, we would like to understand how to account for the tetra-
hedral arrangement of C Â¬H bonds in methane in terms of the 2s and 2p orbitals of the 
central carbon atom, which are not directed toward the apices of a tetrahedron. How can 
we reconcile the notion that covalent bonds are formed from overlap of atomic orbitals 
with the molecular geometries that come from the VSEPR model?
To begin with, we recall that atomic orbitals are mathematical functions that come 
from the quantum-mechanical model for atomic structure. 
 (Section 6.5) To explain 
molecular geometries, we often assume that the atomic orbitals on an atom (usually the 
central atom) mix to form new orbitals called hybrid orbitals. The shape of any hybrid 
orbital is different from the shapes of the original atomic orbitals. The process of mixing 
atomic orbitals is a mathematical operation called hybridization. T
