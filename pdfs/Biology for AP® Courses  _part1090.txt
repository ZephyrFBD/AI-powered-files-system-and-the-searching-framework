se promotes an increase; cell
division: binding of epinephrine (adrenaline) to a
G-protein-linked receptor.
28. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade
triggered by RTKs results in cell division. Create a few
possible scenarios of abnormalities in the MAPK pathway
leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.
a.
gain of function mutation in RAS protein,
mutation in I κ -B, loss of function mutation in
genes for MAPK kinase pathway, regulated
phosphorylation cascade
b.
loss of function mutation in RAS protein and
gain of function mutation in RAF protein, I κ -B
permanently bound to NF- κ B, regulated
phosphorylation cascade
c.
RAS protein unable to hydrolyze its bound GTP,
loss of function mutation in I κ -B, gain of
function mutation in genes for MAPK kinase
pathway, unregulated phosphorylation cascade
d.
unregulated phosphorylation cascade, loss of
function mutation in RAS and RAF protein,
mutation in genes for MAPK kinase pathway,
regulated phosphorylation cascade
