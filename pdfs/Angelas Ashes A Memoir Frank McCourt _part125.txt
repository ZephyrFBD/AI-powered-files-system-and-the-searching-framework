 Quinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul’ bastard. Is he going

 A door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears.Are any of 
 
 ye waiting for children’s boots? 
 
 Women raise their hands, I am. I am. 
 
 Well, the boots are all gone.Ye’ll have to come back next month. 
 
 But my Mikey needs boots for school. 
 
 They’re all gone, I told you. 
 
 But ’tis freezin’ abroad, Mr. Quinlivan. 
 
 The boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What’s this? Who’s

 Nora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to the 
 
 last ash. 
 
 Every puff you take, he starts. 
 
 I know, she says, I’m taking food out of the mouths of my children. 
 
 You’re insolent,woman.You’ll get no charity here. 
 
 Is that a fact? Well,Mr. Quinlivan, if I don’t get it here I know where 
 
 I will.
