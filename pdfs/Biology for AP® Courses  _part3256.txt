mus, which serves as the routing
station for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions
remain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. When visual signals leave the thalamus, they
travel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions.
One stream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (“where”) information. A second
stream projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (“where”) and parvocellular (“what”) information.
Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain, where eye
movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information. Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to b
