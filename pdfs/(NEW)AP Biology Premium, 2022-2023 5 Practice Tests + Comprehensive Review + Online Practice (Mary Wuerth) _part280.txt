mologous chromosomes. These events create mutations called translocations. While
translocations can also generate new combinations of genetic material, if they occur in the middle of a gene, they may inactivate it, resulting in an
unfavorable phenotype.
Genetic diversity can also be generated during the metaphase I stage of meiosis. Recall that during metaphase I,
homologous pairs of chromosomes line up along the center of the cell. Each pair of chromosomes lines up and
assorts independently, with different pairs having the paternal chromosome (from the male parent) on one side and
the maternal chromosome (from the female parent) on the other side. For example, if an organism has two pairs of
chromosomes, each time meiosis occurs, the two pairs may assort independently, resulting in a different
combination of genetic material being passed on to the offspring, as shown in Figure 12.4.
