NMR imaging (MRI)
The 
nucleus consists of a single proton. Its spin angular momentum (and its
magnetic moment), like that of the electron, can take on only two values when
placed in a magnetic field: we call these “spin up” (parallel to the field) and “spin
down” (antiparallel to the field), as suggested in Fig. 31–23. When a magnetic
field is present, the energy of the nucleus splits into two levels as shown in
Fig. 31–24, with the spin up (parallel to field) having the lower energy. (This is
like the Zeeman effect for atomic levels, Fig. 28–8.) The difference in energy 
between these two levels is proportional to the total magnetic field 
at the
nucleus:
where k is a proportionality constant that is different for different nuclides.
In a standard nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) setup, the sample to be
examined is placed in a static magnetic field. A radiofrequency (RF) pulse of
electromagnetic radiation (that is, photons) is applied to the sampl
