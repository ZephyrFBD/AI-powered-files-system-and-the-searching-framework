68. Students observe several slides of tissue cross-sections
under the microscope. They are asked to develop a key
system to classify the slides as coming from either
monocot or dicots. What key system should the students
develop?
a.
In monocots, the vascular bundles form a
distinct ring. In dicots, the vascular bundles are
scattered in the ground tissue.
b.
In monocots, the vascular tissue forms a
characteristic X shape in the center. In dicots, the
phloem and xylem cells are scattered in the pith.
c.
In monocots, the vascular bundles are scattered
in the ground tissue. In dicots the vascular
bundles form a distinct ring.
