rios. Students are expected 
to interpret and evaluate experimental results,  
analyze biological concepts and scientific 
investigations, and perform data analysis 
andÂ statistical testing. 
A foundational concept for students to 
understand is that biological systems 
depend on relationships that, when 
compromised, can have far-reaching 
consequences within the system. These 
consequences can sometimes be 
deleterious for cells, organisms, and even 
ecosystems. This understanding will help 
students make and justify predictions about 
how the changes in a biological system 
affect its function. 
On the exam, students tend to struggle with 
the use of language and similar terms, for 
example, protein versus proton. This confusion 
often results in a failure to earn points on free-
response questions. T

students accountable for the proper use of 
appropriate terms throughout the course.
