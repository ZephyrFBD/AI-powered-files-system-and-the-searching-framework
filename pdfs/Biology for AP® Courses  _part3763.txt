nsported more efficiently than in
open circulatory system.
25. What is one advantage of a four chambered heart over
a three chambered heart?
a.
Oxygenated blood carried by the right side of the
heart is completely separated from the left side
carrying deoxygenated blood, which assists in
more efficient movement of oxygen around the
body and aids in allowing the body to quickly
move when needed.
b.
A four-chambered heart keeps oxygenated and
deoxygenated blood separated and has double
circulation whereas a three-chambered heart has
a single circulation. This assists in more efficient
movement of oxygen around the body.
c.
Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept
separate in a four-chambered heart, which assists
in more efficient movement of carbon dioxide
around the body.
d.
Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept
separate in a four-chambered heart, which assists
in more efficient movement of oxygen around
the body and aids in allowing the body to move
quickly when needed.
