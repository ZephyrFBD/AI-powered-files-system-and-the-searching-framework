al energy is transferred to NADH
and ATP.
ATP is required for all cellular functions. It is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues;
it provides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. When the
amount of ATP is available in excess of the bodyâ€™s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and excess glucose to
produce molecules called glycogen. Glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle
cells. When blood sugar drops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen. Skeletal muscle converts glycogen to
glucose during intense exercise. The process of converting glucose and excess ATP to glycogen and the storage of excess
energy is an evolutionarily important step in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine.
