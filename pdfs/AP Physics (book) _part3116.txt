l quantum phenomena from
blackbody radiation to atoms and molecules. It has explained a wide range of
natural phenomena and from its predictions many new practical devices have
become possible. Indeed, it has been so successful that it is accepted today by
nearly all physicists as the fundamental theory underlying physical processes.
Quantum mechanics deals mainly with the microscopic world of atoms and
light. But this new theory, when it is applied to macroscopic phenomena, must be
able to produce the old classical laws. This, the correspondence principle (already
mentioned in Section 27–12), is satisfied fully by quantum mechanics.
This doesn’t mean we should throw away classical theories such as Newton’s
laws. In the everyday world, classical laws are far easier to apply and they give
sufficiently accurate descriptions. But when we deal with high speeds, close to
the speed of light, we must use the theory of relativity; and when we deal with the
tiny world of the atom, we use quantu
