perors, And walk upon the
dreadful adder's back, Treading the lion and the dragon down, And fearless
spurn the killing basilisk," So will we quell that haughty schismatic, And,
by authority apostolical, Depose him from his regal government.

BRUNO. Pope Julius swore to princely Sigismond, For him and the
succeeding Popes of Rome, To hold the Emperors their lawful lords.
POPE. Pope Julius did abuse the church's rights, And therefore none of
his decrees can stand. Is not all power on earth bestow'd on us? And

is fix'd Seven golden seals, fast sealed with seven seals, In token of our
seven-fold power from heaven, To bind or loose, lock fast, condemn or
judge, Resign or seal, or what so pleaseth us: Then he and thou, and all the
world, shall stoop, Or be assured of our dreadful curse, To light as heavy
as the pains of hell.
