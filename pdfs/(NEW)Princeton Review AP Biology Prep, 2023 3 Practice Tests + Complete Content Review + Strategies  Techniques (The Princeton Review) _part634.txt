 is more difficult to
stay alive and to reproduce, so mortality is high and reproductivity low. Figure 2 shows the number of
surviving offspring per mating pair plotted against the number of breeding adults present (the graph covers
several years).
Figure 2
(a) Describe the carrying capacity in a population. Can a brood size have a carrying capacity? Justify your
choice.
(b) This study involved observing birds in their natural habitat. Identify the independent variable in this brood
size vs. percent survival study. Describe what makes an observational study different from a study inside
a lab environment.
(c) Describe the brood size(s) in which 100% of the offspring survive. Identify which brood size has the
highest percent of mortality.
(d) Over many more years the number of breeding adults was measured, and it was found that over a long time
the number of breeding adults averaged around 100. Describe how this would change the information in
Figure 1. Justify your answer.
