 formula 
of the compound? (b) Nicotine, a component of tobacco, is 
composed of C, H, and N. A 5.250-mg sample of nicotine was 
combusted, producing 14.242 mg of CO2 and 4.083 mg of 
H2O. What is the empirical formula for nicotine? If nicotine 
has a molar mass of 160 { 5 g>mol, what is its molecular 
formula?
 3.57 Valproic acid, used to treat seizures and bipolar disorder, is 
composed of C, H, and O. A 0.165-g sample is combusted 
to produce 0.166 g of water and 0.403 g of carbon dioxide. 
What is the empirical formula for valproic acid? If the molar 
mass is 144 g>mol, what is the molecular formula?
 3.58  Propenoic acid, C3H4O2, is a reactive organic liquid that 
is used in the manufacturing of plastics, coatings, and ad-
hesives. An unlabeled container is thought to contain this 
liquid. A 0.275-g sample of the liquid is combusted to pro-
duce 0.102 g of water and 0.374 g carbon dioxide. Is the un-
known liquid propenoic acid? Support your reasoning with 
calculations.
