dness and farsightedness. Both can 
be corrected to a large extent with lenses—either eyeglasses or contact lenses.
In nearsightedness, or myopia, the human eye can focus only on nearby 
objects. The far point is not infinity but some shorter distance, so distant objects
are not seen clearly. Nearsightedness is usually caused by an eyeball that is too
long, although sometimes it is the curvature of the cornea that is too great.
In either case, images of distant objects are focused in front of the retina.
