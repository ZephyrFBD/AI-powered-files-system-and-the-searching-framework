differential evolution creates reproductive
barriers that prevent interbreeding. As a result, new species have formed. In summary,
geographic barrier → reproductive isolation → differential evolution → reproductive barriers → new species
2. Sympatric speciation is the formation of new species without the presence of a geographic barrier. This may
happen in several different ways, as follows:
Balanced polymorphism among subpopulations may lead to speciation. Suppose, for example, a population of
insects possesses a polymorphism for color. Each color provides a camouflage to a different substrate, and if not
camouflaged, the insect is eaten. Under these circumstances, only insects with the same color can associate and
mate. Thus, similarly colored insects are reproductively isolated from other subpopulations, and their gene pools
diverge as in allopatric speciation.
Polyploidy is the possession of more than the normal two sets of chromosomes found in diploid (2n) cells.
Polyploidy often
