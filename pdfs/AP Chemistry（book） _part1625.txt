inders. A stream of gas moves the 235UF6 from the center of one cen-
trifuge into another. Plants that use centrifuges consume less energy 
than those that use effusion and can be constructed in a more com-
pact, modular fashion. Such plants are frequently in the news today 
as countries such as Iran and North Korea enrich uranium in the 
235U isotope for both nuclear power and nuclear weaponry.

â–² Figure 10.16  Uranium enrichment by gaseous diffusion. The lighter 235UF6 effuses through a  
porous barrier at a slightly faster rate than 238UF6. The pressure difference across the membrane  
drives the effusion. The enrichment shown here for a single step is exaggerated for ill
