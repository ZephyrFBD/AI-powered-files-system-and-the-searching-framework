Electric Charge and Electric Field
61. A point charge of mass 0.185 kg, and net charge
hangs at rest at the end of an insulating cord above a large
sheet of charge. The horizontal sheet of fixed uniform charge
creates a uniform vertical electric field in the vicinity of 
the point charge. The tension in the cord is measured to be
5.18 N. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric
field due to the sheet of charge (Fig. 16–67).
