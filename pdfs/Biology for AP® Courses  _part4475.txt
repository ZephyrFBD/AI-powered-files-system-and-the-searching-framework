by salivating. After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung,
even when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent. Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus
and the salivation became the conditioned response. Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned
and conditioned responses are identical, even Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic
differences when compared to the unconditioned dog.

It had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus
