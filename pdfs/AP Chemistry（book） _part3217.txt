 = RT ln K. Because 
∆G° is a large negative number, which 
means the reaction is thermodynamically 
very favorable, we expect K to be large.
 
∆G° = -RT ln K
 -1.7 * 105 J>mol = -18.314 J>K mol2 1298 K2 ln K
 
ln K =
-1.7 * 105 J>mol
-18.314 J>K mol21298 K2
 
ln K = 69
 
K = 9 * 1029
(b) The overall equation is the same as that in 
part (a), multiplied by 1
2. The half-reactions 
are:
Reduction:   1
2 O21g2 + 2 H+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡  H2O1l2      
  E °
red = +1.23 V
Oxidation: 
 
 
  2 Ag1s2 ¡ 2 Ag+1aq2 + 2 e-  E °
red = +0.80 V
Comment E ° is an intensive quantity, so multiplying a chemical 
equation by a certain factor will not affect the value of E°. Multi-
plying an equation will change the value of n, however, and hence 
the value of ∆G°. The change in free energy, in units of J/mol of 
reaction as written, is an extensive quantity. The equilibrium con-
stant is also an extensive quantity.
