ter is easily accessible from lakes and rivers. Many living things, such
as plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on the small amount of fresh surface water supply, a lack of which can have
massive effects on ecosystem dynamics. Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability,
such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the
ocean. Although this pursuit of drinkable water has been ongoing throughout human history, the supply of fresh water is
still a major issue in modern times.

accessible to living things.
Water cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics. Water has a major influence on climate and, thus, on the
environments of ecosystems, some located on distant parts of the Earth. Most of the water on Earth is stored for long pe
