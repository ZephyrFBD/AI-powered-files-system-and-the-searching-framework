ence markers like green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) and its cousins make it possible to measure gene expression directly, to follow cell 
populations as they grow or move, and to find cells that have taken up a second plasmid 
that we cannot see easily. Thus, you have freedom in choosing a plasmid transformation 
system. 
The following materials are included in a typical eight-station ampicillin-resistant 
plasmid system. The list will vary depending on the system used. Materials and 
supplies needed for each student workstation are provided in the student version of this 
investigation. Students are encouraged to set up their own workstations. Note that you 
might need additional materials such as agar plates and nutrient agar for the student 
inquiry investigations.
