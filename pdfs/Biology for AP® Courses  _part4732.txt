rate of endemism is highest, and there are more biodiversity hotspots. However, this richness of diversity also means that
knowledge of species is lowest, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss.
Conservation of Biodiversity
In 1988, British environmentalist Norman Myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and
at significant risk for species loss: biodiversity hotspots. Biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high
numbers of endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation
efforts, a kind of conservation triage. By protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species.
The original criteria for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area
disturbed by human activity. There are now 34 biodiversity hotspots (Figure 38.4) containing large number
