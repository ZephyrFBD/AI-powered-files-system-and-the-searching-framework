ount of power generated by a stack depends on the number and size of the fuel 
cells in the stack and on the surface area of the PEM.
Much fuel cell research today is directed toward improving electrolytes and catalysts 
and developing cells that use fuels such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, which are less dif-
ficult to handle and distribute than hydrogen gas.

20.8 ∣ Corrosion
In this section, we examine the undesirable redox reactions that lead to corrosion of 
metals. Corrosion reactions are spontaneous redox reactions in which a metal is attacked 
by some substance in its environment and converted to an unwanted compound.
For nearly all metals, oxidation is thermodynamically favorable in air at room tem-
perature. When oxidation of a metal object is not inhibited, it can destroy the object. 
Oxidation can form an insulating protective oxide layer, however, that prevents further 
reaction of the underlying
