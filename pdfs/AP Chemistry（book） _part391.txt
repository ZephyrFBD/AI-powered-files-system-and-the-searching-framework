opane? Are there isomers of 
chlorocyclopropane?
 2.109 Elements in the same group of the periodic table often form 
oxyanions with the same general formula. The anions are 
also named in a similar fashion. Based on these observations, 
suggest a chemical formula or name, as appropriate, for each 
of the following ions: (a) BrO4
-, (b) SeO3
2-, (c) arsenate ion, 
(d) hydrogen tellurate ion.
 2.110 Carbonic acid occurs in carbonated beverages. When al-
lowed to react with lithium hydroxide, it produces lithium 
carbonate. Lithium carbonate is used to treat depression and 
bipolar disorder. Write chemical formulas for carbonic acid, 
lithium hydroxide, and lithium carbonate.
 2.111  Give the chemical names of each of the following familiar 
compounds: (a) NaCl (table salt), (b) NaHCO3 (baking soda), 
(c) NaOCl (in many bleaches), (d) NaOH (caustic soda), 
 
(e) (NH4)2CO3 (smelling salts), (f) CaSO4 (plaster of Paris).
 2.112  Many familiar substances have common, unsystematic 
names. For
