Figure 29.19 Compact bone tissue consists of osteons that are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone, and
the Haversian canal that contains the boneâ€™s blood vessels and nerve fibers. The inner layer of bones consists
of spongy bone tissue. The small dark ovals in the osteon represent the living osteocytes. (credit: modification of

Spongy Bone Tissue
Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all
bones. Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue. Instead, it consists of trabeculae,
which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae. Blood vessels
within this tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. The red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of
other large bones, such as the ileum, forms blood cells.
Spongy bone reduces the density
