RNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome
also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned
amino acids. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70â€“90 nucleotides long. It
carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows
for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain. microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their
role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA messages. Table 3.2
summarizes features of DNA and RNA.
