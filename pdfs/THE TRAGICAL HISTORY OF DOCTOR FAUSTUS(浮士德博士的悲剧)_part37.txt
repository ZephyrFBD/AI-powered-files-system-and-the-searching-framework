FAUSTUS. Thanks, mighty Lucifer! This will I keep as chary as my
life.
LUCIFER. Now, Faustus, farewell.
FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer. [Exeunt LUCIFER and
BELZEBUB.]

ROBIN. What, Dick! look to the horses there, till I come again. I have
gotten one of Doctor Faustus' conjuring-books; and now we'll have such
knavery as't passes.
Enter DICK.
DICK. What, Robin! you must come away and walk the horses.
ROBIN. I walk the horses!  I scorn't, faith:<89>  I have other
matters in hand:  let the horses walk themselves, an they will.-- [Reads.]
A per se, a; t, h, e, the; o per se, o; Demy orgon gorgon.-- Keep further

DICK. 'Snails, what hast thou got there? a book! why, thou canst not
tell<90> ne'er a word on't.
ROBIN. That thou shalt see presently:  keep out of the circle, I say,
lest I send you into the ostry with a vengeance.
