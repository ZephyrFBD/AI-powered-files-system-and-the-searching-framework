ys. One method
is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. The
other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. These
transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.
Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of
a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. The first part of the glycolysis pathway
traps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly
into the two three-carbon molecules. The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the
form of ATP and NADH, the reduced form of NAD+.
