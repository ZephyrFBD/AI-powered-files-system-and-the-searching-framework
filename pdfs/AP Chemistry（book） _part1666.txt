tatements best explains why 
nitrogen gas at STP is less dense than Xe gas at STP?
(a) Because Xe is a noble gas, there is less tendency for the Xe 
atoms to repel one another, so they pack more densely in 
the gaseous state.
(b) Xe atoms have a higher mass than N2 molecules. Because 
both gases at STP have the same number of molecules per 
unit volume, the Xe gas must be denser.
(c) The Xe atoms are larger than N2 molecules and thus take 
up a larger fraction of the space occupied by the gas.
(d) Because the Xe atoms are much more massive than the 
N2 molecules, they move more slowly and thus exert 
less upward force on the gas container and make the gas 
appear denser.
