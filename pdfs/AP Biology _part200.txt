to acetyl-CoA produces 2
molecules of NADH, 1 NADH for each pyruvate.
Each turn of the Krebs cycle releases 3 NADH, 1 ATP, 1 FADH,
and the waste product CO2, which is exhaled. (Remember, two
turns of the Krebs cycle occur per glucose molecule.)

■
During the Krebs cycle, ATP is produced by substrate level
phosphorylation—direct enzymatic transfer of a phosphate to
ADP. Very little energy is produced this way compared with the
amount produced by oxidative phosphorylation.
STUDY TIP
Your teacher may want you to memorize this, but you won’t need to know the specifics for the
AP exam.

Figure 6.6 The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)
NAD+ AND FAD
NAD and FAD are required for normal cell respiration.
NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin
adenine dinucleotide) are coenzymes that carry protons or
electrons from glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to the electron
transport ch
