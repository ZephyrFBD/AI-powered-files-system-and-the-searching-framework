ces are also
possible, but we will concentrate on spherical.) The two faces can be concave,
convex, or plane. Several types are shown in Figs. 23–31a and b in cross section.
The importance of lenses is that they form images of objects—see Fig. 23–32.

Axis
The rays from a point on a distant object are essentially parallel—see Fig.23–12.
Therefore we can say that the focal point is the image point for an object at infinity
on the lens axis, Fig. 23–33. Thus, the focal point of a lens can be found by
locating the point where the Sun’s rays (or those from some other distant object) are
brought to a sharp image, Fig. 23–34. The distance of the focal point from the
center of the lens is called the focal length, f, Fig. 23–33. A lens can be turned
around so that light can pass through it from the opposite side. The focal length is
the same on both sides, as we shall see later, even if the curvatures of the two lens
surfaces are different. If parallel rays fall on a lens at an angle, as in
