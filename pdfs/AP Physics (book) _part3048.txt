In low-density gases, the atoms are far apart on average and hence the light
emitted or absorbed is assumed to be by individual atoms rather than through
interactions between atoms, as in a solid, liquid, or dense gas. Thus the line
spectra serve as a key to the structure of the atom: any theory of atomic structure
must be able to explain why atoms emit light only of discrete wavelengths, and it
should be able to predict what these wavelengths are.
Hydrogen is the simplest atom—it has only one electron orbiting its nucleus.
It also has the simplest spectrum. The spectrum of most atoms shows little
apparent regularity. But the spacing between lines in the hydrogen spectrum
decreases in a regular way, Fig. 27–24. Indeed, in 1885, J. J. Balmer (1825–1898)
showed that the four lines in the visible portion of the hydrogen spectrum (with
measured wavelengths 656 nm, 486 nm, 434 nm, and 410 nm) have wavelengths
that fit the formula
