 tube. A beam of electrons, emitted by the heated cathode, is accelerated by
the high-voltage anode and passes through a small hole in that anode. The inside
of the tube face on the right (the screen) is coated with a fluorescent material that
glows at the spot where the electrons hit. Voltage applied across the horizontal
and vertical deflection plates, Fig.17–29, can be varied to deflect the electron beam
to different spots on the screen.

FIGURE 17–28 If the cathode inside
the evacuated glass tube is heated to
glowing (by an electric current, not
shown), negatively charged 
“cathode rays” (
electrons) are
“boiled off” and flow across to the
anode 
to which they are
attracted.
