When an action potential is stimulated,
the nerve is said to have “fired.”
What causes the action potential? At the point where the stimulus occurs, the
membrane suddenly alters its permeability, becoming much more permeable to
than to 
and 
ions. Thus,
ions rush into the cell and the inner surface
of the wall becomes positively charged, and the potential difference quickly swings
positive (
in Fig. 18–30). Just as suddenly, the membrane returns to 
its original characteristics; it becomes impermeable to 
and in fact pumps out
ions. The diffusion of 
and 
ions again predominates and the original
resting potential is restored (
in Fig. 18–30).
