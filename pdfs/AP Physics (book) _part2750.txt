e third sheet is 90° relative to the first one. Unpolarized
light impinges on the first polarizing sheet. What percent
of this light is transmitted out through the third polarizer?
65. (II) A piece of material, suspected of being a stolen 
diamond 
is submerged in oil of refractive index
1.43 and illuminated by unpolarized light. It is found that
the reflected light is completely polarized at an angle of 62°.
Is it diamond? Explain.
66. (II) Two Polaroids are aligned so that the initially unpolar-
ized light passing through them is a maximum. At what angle
should one of them be placed so the transmitted intensity is
subsequently reduced by half?
67. (II) What is Brewster’s angle for a diamond submerged in
water?
68. (II) The critical angle for total internal reflection at
a boundary between two materials is 58°. What is Brewster’s
angle at this boundary? Give two answers, one for each
material.
69. (II) What would Brewster’s angle be for reflections off the
surface of water for light c
