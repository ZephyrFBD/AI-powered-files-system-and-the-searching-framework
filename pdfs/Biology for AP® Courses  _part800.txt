olecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In
this pathway, phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less
active when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is “sufficient” ATP in the system, the
pathway slows down. This is a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.
Step 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis
employs an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone-
phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
Step

In

an
isomerase
transforms
the
dihydroxyacetone-phosphate
into

isomer,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. At this
point in the pathway, there is a net
