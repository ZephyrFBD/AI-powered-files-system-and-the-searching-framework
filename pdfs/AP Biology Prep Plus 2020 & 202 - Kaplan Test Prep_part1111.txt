The hypertonic soil makes the plant’s cell walls more permeable to
water.

oxygen output of each plant over a 24-hour period. If the majority of the
pea plant’s biomass is comprised of leaves, plants grown in which soil
sample would be expected to produce the least oxygen?

45. In humans, an increase in blood pressure will lead to increased
parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity. These
changes, in turn, may aﬀect heart rate, hormone release, and blood
vessel diameter. All of these mechanisms function together to return the
blood pressure to its set point when there are deviations.
What two processes will the autonomic nervous system initiate at the
point indicated by the arrow in Figure 1 ?
