for the reaction.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two ionic reactants and asked to predict the 
insoluble product that they form.
Plan We need to write the ions present in the reactants and ex-
change the anions between the two cations. Once we have written 
the chemical formulas for these products, we can use Table 4.1 to 
determine which is insoluble in water. Knowing the products also 
allows us to write the equation for the reaction.
Solve
(a)  
The reactants contain Ba2+, Cl-, K+, and SO4
2- ions. Exchang-
ing the anions gives us BaSO4 and KCl. According to Table 4.1, 
most compounds of SO4
2- are soluble but those of Ba2+ are 
not. Thus, BaSO4 is insoluble and will precipitate from solu-
tion. KCl is soluble.
(b)  
From part (a) we know the chemical formulas of the products, 
BaSO4 and KCl. The balanced equation is 
BaCl21aq2 + K2SO41aq2 ¡ BaSO41s2 + 2 KCl1aq2
