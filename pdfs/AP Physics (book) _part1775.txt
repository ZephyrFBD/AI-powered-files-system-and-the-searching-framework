FIGURE 16–36 Example 16–11.
Shielding, and safety in a storm. A neu-
tral hollow metal box is placed between two parallel charged plates as shown in
Fig. 16–36a. What is the field like inside the box?
RESPONSE If our metal box had been solid, and not hollow, free electrons in
the box would have redistributed themselves along the surface until all their
individual fields would have canceled each other inside the box. The net field
