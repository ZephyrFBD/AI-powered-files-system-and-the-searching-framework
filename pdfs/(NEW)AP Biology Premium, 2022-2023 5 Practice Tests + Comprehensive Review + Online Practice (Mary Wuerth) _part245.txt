s then added to Petri dish 4.
Predict the effect this molecule will have on the glucose concentration in Petri dish 4 at 30 minutes after
the addition of the hormone.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).

13. A signaling pathway for adrenaline is shown in the following diagram.
Researchers wanted to measure the effects of three different molecules on the adrenaline signaling pathway.
Data are shown in the following table.
(a) Describe the parts of the cell signaling process that are represented in each of the five numbered steps in
the diagram.
(b) Identify the control, the independent variable, and the dependent variables in this experimental procedure.
(c) Analyze the data, and identify which molecule(s) most likely interferes with the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.
(d) Cyclic AMPâ€“dependent phosphodiesterase is an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP. Predict the
numbered step in the diagram that would be most directly affected by adding cAMP-dependent
phosphodiestera
