igure 10.21, we would see that 
a molecule about to collide with the wall experiences the attractive 
forces of nearby molecules. These attractions lessen the force with 
which the molecule hits the wall. As a result, the gas pressure is less 
than that of an ideal gas. This effect decreases PV>RT to below its

▲ Figure 10.19 The effect of temperature and pressure on the behavior of nitrogen gas.
True or false: Nitrogen gas behaves more like an ideal gas as 
the temperature increases.
Give It Some Thought
Under which conditions do you expect helium gas to deviate most from ideal 
behavior? (a) 100 K and 1 atm, (b) 100 K and 5 atm, (c) 300 K and 2 atm.

than in an ideal gas.
