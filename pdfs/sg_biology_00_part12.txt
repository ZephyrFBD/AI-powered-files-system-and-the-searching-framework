the set point:
• evaporative  cooling (sweating, panting)
 
When body temperature drops below the set point:
• shunting
• thyroxin increases metabolism (generates heat)
• the blood is rewarmed by countercurrent exchange (heat conduction from the warm blood to returning blood is redirected to the
internal parts of the body before reaching extremities)
• electron transport is uncoupled in brown fat
 
Behavioral responses must be physiologically related to the choice and the link clearly made
 
   Ex: neural activity  skeletal muscle  locomotion (e.g., seek warmth, seek shade)
