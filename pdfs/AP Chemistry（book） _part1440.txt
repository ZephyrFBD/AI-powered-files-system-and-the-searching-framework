scribed by wave functions, which we call atomic orbitals. In a similar way, molecular 
orbital theory describes the electrons in molecules by using specific wave functions, each 
of which is called a molecular orbital (MO).
Molecular orbitals have many of the same characteristics as atomic orbitals. For 
example, an MO can hold a maximum of two electrons (with opposite spins), it has a 
definite energy, and we can visualize its electron-density distribution by using a contour 
representation, as we did with atomic orbitals. Unlike atomic orbitals, however, MOs are 
associated with an entire molecule, not with a single atom.
Molecular Orbitals of the Hydrogen Molecule
We begin our study of MO theory with the hydrogen molecule, H2. We will use the two 1s 
atomic orbitals (one on each H atom) to construct molecular orbitals for H2. Whenever two 
atomic orbitals overlap, two molecular orbitals form. Thus, the overlap of the 1s orbitals of two 
hydrogen atoms to form H2 produces two MOs. Th
