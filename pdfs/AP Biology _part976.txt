he
population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
The frequency of the allele will remain the same; this is an
example of the bottleneck effect.
 
Questions 15 and 16
You carry out an experiment to study transpiration in plants using a two-
week-old bean plant. You set up a potometer by cutting the stem of a plant
and securing it into clear flexible tubing that has been tightly connected to
a calibrated pipette. Water fills the potometer from the plant stem to the tip
of the pipette.
You measure water loss from your potometer at 10-minute intervals and
plot your data on the graph below as Line B:

You then explore what happens if you expose the plant to different
conditions. Which of the following statements is correct based on
proposed changes to the potometer?
Increasing the green wavelengths of light will increase the rate
of transpiration and account for Line A on the graph.
