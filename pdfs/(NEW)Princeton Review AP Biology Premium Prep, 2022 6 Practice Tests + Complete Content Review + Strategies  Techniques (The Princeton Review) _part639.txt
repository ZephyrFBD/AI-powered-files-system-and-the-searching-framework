stomach acid would disrupt the function of the enzymes. Food moving too quickly would decrease
digestion/absorption rates but the function of the enzyme would be intact. Removal of water should not
greatly affect enzyme function.

Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer should start with ribosome. So
eliminate (A) and (C). The polypeptide then moves through the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it
is modified and packaged into a vesicle. The vesicle then floats to the plasma membrane and is secreted.
Choice (D) is your answer.

Choice (D) is false because an individual with two identical alleles is said to be homozygous, not
heterozygous, with respect to that gene. Alleles are different forms of the same gene found on
corresponding positions of homologous chromosomes, so (A) and (B) are incorrect. More than two alleles
can exist for a gene, but a person can have only two alleles for each trait.

A transformation is the uptake of DN
