s-
ness of an electric shock depends on the current and thus on the applied voltage
and the effective resistance of the body. Living tissue has low resistance because
the fluid of cells contains ions that can conduct quite well. However, the outer
layer of skin, when dry, offers high resistance and is thus protective. The effective
resistance between two points on opposite sides of the body when the skin is dry
is on the order of 
to 
But when the skin is wet, the resistance may be 
or less. A person who is barefoot or wearing thin-soled shoes will be in good contact
with the ground, and touching a 120-V line with a wet hand can result in a current
As we saw, this could be lethal.
