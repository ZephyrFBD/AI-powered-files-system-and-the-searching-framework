gure 36.13). Mammoths survived
in isolated island populations as recently as 1700 BC. We know a lot about these animals from carcasses
found frozen in the ice of Siberia and other regions of the north. Scientists have sequenced at least 50
percent of its genome and believe mammoths are between 98 and 99 percent identical to modern elephants.
It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study
estimated that climate change reduced the mammoth’s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years
ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago.
[6] It is also well documented that humans hunted these
animals. A 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively responsible for the extinction of these
magnificent creatures.
[7] In addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of habitat, these
scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth’s extinction was the migration of humans
across the Bering Strait to North Americ
