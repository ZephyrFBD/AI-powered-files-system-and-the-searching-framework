y to the mRNA strand. Using the mRNA strand, work backward to
establish the sequence of the DNA strand. Don’t forget that DNA strands do not contain uracil, so eliminate
(B) and (D).
60. B
Use the amino acid chart to determine the sequence after uracil is deleted. The deletion of uracil creates a
frameshift.
Section II: Free Response
Short student-style responses have been provided for each of the questions. These samples indicate an answer that
would get full credit, so if you’re checking your own response, make sure that the actual answers to each part of the
question are similar to your own. The structure surrounding them is less important, although we’ve modeled it as a
way to help organize your own thoughts and to make sure that you actually respond to the entire question.
Note that the rubrics used for scoring periodically change based on the College Board’s analysis of the previous
year’s test takers. We’ve done our best to approximate their structure, based on our institutional
