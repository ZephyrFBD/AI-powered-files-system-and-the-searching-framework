Based on these findings, is it reasonable to expect that herbicide
resistance may spread from resistant plants?
No, because the percentage of pollen-mediated gene flow is
too low to have a significant eï¬€ect on future generations. This
suggests that the amount of resistance will not increase in
future years.
(A)
No, because it does not matter what genes are in the pollen
as long as the resistance genes are not in the seeds. The table
would need to show data on resistance in seeds in order to
draw conclusions about whether future generations will
show resistance.
(B)
Yes, because the trials consistently showed pollen-mediated
gene flow within 5 meters of the resistant plant and less
consistent gene flow within 15 meters. This suggests that
more plants will be resistant in the next generation.
(C)
Yes, because the trials consistently showed pollen-mediated
gene flow within 5 meters of the resistant plant. This suggests
that pollen is spreading to plants immediately adjacent to the
resi
