 that the 
central atom is generally less electronegative than the atoms surrounding it. In other 
cases, you may need more information before you can draw the Lewis structure.
 
3. Complete the octets around all the atoms bonded to the central atom. 
Keep in mind that a hydrogen atom has only a single pair of electrons around it.
 
4. Place any remaining electrons on the central atom, even if doing so results 
in more than an octet of electrons around the atom.
 
5. If there are not enough electrons to give the central atom an octet, try 
multiple bonds. Use one or more of the unshared pairs of electrons on the atoms 
bonded to the central atom to form double or triple bonds.
The following examples of this procedure will help you put it into practice.
Give It Some Thought
You have a yellow solid that melts at 41 °C and boils at 131 °C and a green solid that 
melts at 2320 °C. If you are told that one of them is Cr2O3 and the other is OsO4, 
which one do you expect to be the yellow sol
