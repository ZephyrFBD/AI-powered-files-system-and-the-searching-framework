ought conditions, the stomata open
its pores wider in order to perform a better rate
of transpiration.
d.
The water will move from the soil to the plant.
Dry soil has a lower water potential than wet
soil. Under drought conditions, the stomata close
to conserve water and leaves may also be shed if
the drought continues.

Plants lose water from their aboveground surfaces in the
process of transpiration. Most of this water is lost from
stomata. Excess loss of water has severe consequences and
may be fatal for the plant. The table shows data collected
on a sunny day. What is the best explanation for the
transpiration rates leveling off and declining at
temperature higher than 27Â°C?
a.
The plant ran out of water.
b.
The plant needs less water as temperature
increases, so transpiration slows down to limit
water uptake by the roots.
c.
Stomata close to conserve water, slowing down
transpiration.
d.
The amount of water in the leaves decreases at
high temperature and less is available for
