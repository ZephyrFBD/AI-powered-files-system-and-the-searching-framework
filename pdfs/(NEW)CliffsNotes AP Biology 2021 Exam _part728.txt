lluted and polluted lakes are both the result of the same eutrophication processes), and the second paragraph
makes a contrast (how the rate of eutrophication is faster in a polluted lake).
Question 3
For this question you should discuss the competitive exclusion principle and how it results in resource partitioning,
character displacement, and realized niches.
Question 4
Although the atmosphere consists of 80% nitrogen gas (N2), plants can
 
utilize nitrogen only in the form of ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3−). Nitrogen fixation, the conversion of N2to
NH4+, occurs by nitrogen-fixing
 
bacteria that live in the soil, or in the root nodules of certain plants such as legumes. In turn, nitrification occurs by
certain nitrifying bacteria that
 
convert NH4+to NO2−(nitrite) and by other nitrifying bacteria that convert NO2−to NO3−. In addition, some N2is
converted to NO3−by the
 
action of lightning. On the other hand, denitrification occurs when
 
denitrifying bacteria convert NO3− back
