tate metal ions that 
interfere with the cleansing action of soap, and baking soda 1NaHCO32. Baking soda is so 
named because this reaction occurs during baking:
 
NaHCO31s2 + H+1aq2 ¡ Na+1aq2 + CO21g2 + H2O1l2 
[22.58]
The H+1aq2 is provided by vinegar, sour milk, or the hydrolysis of certain salts. The bub-
bles of CO2 that form are trapped in the baking dough, causing it to rise.

Give It Some Thought
Yeast are living organisms that make bread rise in the absence of baking soda and 
acid. What must the yeast be producing to make bread rise?
Carbonic Acid and Carbonates
Carbon dioxide is moderately soluble in H2O at atmospheric pressure. The resulting solu-
tion is moderately acidic because of the formation of carbonic acid 1H2CO32:
 
CO21aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H2CO31aq2 
[22.59]
Carbonic acid is a weak diprotic acid. Its acidic character causes carbonated beverages to
