 airplane is heading due south at a speed of
If a wind begins blowing from the southwest at
a speed of 
(average), calculate (a) the velocity
(magnitude and direction) of the plane, relative to the
ground, and (b) how far from its intended position it will
be after 11.0 min if the pilot takes no corrective action.
[Hint: First draw a diagram.]
45. (II) In what direction should the pilot aim the plane in
Problem 44 so that it will fly due south?
46. (II) A swimmer is capable of swimming 
in still
water. (a) If she aims her body directly across a 45-m-wide
river whose current is 
how far downstream (from
a point opposite her starting point) will she land? (b) How
long will it take her to reach the other side?
47. (II) (a) At what upstream angle must the swimmer in
Problem 46 aim, if she is to arrive at a point directly across
the stream? (b) How long will it take her?
