c.
Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous
chromosomes to separate during meiosis I or the
failure of sister chromatids to separate during
meiosis II, leading to the formation of n+1/n-1/n
chromosomes.
d.
Nondisjunction occurs when the sister
chromatids fail to separate during mitosis II,
resulting in the formation of gametes containing
n+1 and n-1/n chromosomes.
10. Select the answer that correctly identifies the various
chromosomal aberrations and their respective genetic
consequence.
a.
nondisjunction - aneuploid gametes; duplication
- physical and mental abnormalities; deletion -
lethal to a diploid organism; inversion -
chromosomal breaks in gene; translocations -
effects depend on how positions of genes are
altered
b.
nondisjunction - physical and mental
abnormalities; inversion - genetic imbalance;
duplication - aneuploid gametes; translocations -
chromosomal breaks in the gene; deletion -
effects depend on how positions of genes are
altered
c.
deletion -aneuploid gam
