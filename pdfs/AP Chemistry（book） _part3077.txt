irection in which 
∆G changes as temperature increases. In part (b) we need to deter-
mine ∆G for the reaction at two temperatures.
Plan We can answer part (a) by determining the sign of ∆S for  
the reaction and then using that information to analyze  
Equation 19.12. In part (b) we use the given ∆H ° and ∆S° values 
for the reaction together with Equation 19.12 to calculate ∆G.
Solve
(a) The temperature dependence of ∆G comes from the entropy 
term in Equation 19.12, ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. We expect ∆S for 
this reaction to be negative because the number of molecules 
of gas is smaller in the products. Because ∆S is negative, -T∆S 
is positive and increases with increasing temperature. As a re-
sult, ∆G becomes less negative (or more positive) with increas-
ing temperature. Thus, the driving force for the production of 
NH3 becomes smaller with increasing temperature.
(b) If we assume that the values for ∆H ° and ∆S° do not change 
with temperature, we can calculate ∆G at any temperature by
