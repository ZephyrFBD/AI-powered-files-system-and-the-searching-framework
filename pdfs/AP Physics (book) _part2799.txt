The magnification of a given lens can be increased a bit by moving the lens
and adjusting your eye so it focuses on the image at the eye’s near point. In this
case,
(see Fig. 25–17a) if your eye is very near the magnifier. Then the
object distance 
is given by
We see from this equation that
as shown in Fig. 25–17a,

(25;2b)
We see that the magnification is slightly greater when the eye is focused at its
near point, as compared to when it is relaxed.
A jeweler’s “loupe.” An 8-cm-focal-length
converging lens is used as a “jeweler’s loupe,” which is a magnifying glass. Esti-

the eye is focused at its near point 
APPROACH The magnification when the eye is relaxed is given by Eq. 25–2a.
When the eye is focused at its near point, we use Eq. 25–2b and we assume the
