ics and, depending on the sit-
uation, will behave more like waves or more like particles. We will soon see that this dual 
wave-particle nature is also a characteristic trait of matter.

If electrons are ejected from a given metal when irradiated with a 10-W red laser 
pointer, what will happen when the same metal is irradiated with a 5-W green laser 
pointer? (a) Electrons will be ejected, (b) electrons will not be ejected, (c) more 
information is needed to answer this question.
To better understand what a photon is, imagine you have a light source that pro-
duces radiation of a single wavelength. Further suppose that you could switch the light 
on and off faster and faster to provide ever-smaller bursts of energy. Einsteinâ€™s photon 
theory tells us that you would eventually come to the smallest energy burst, given by 
E = hn. This smallest burst consists of a single photon of light.
