erence is negative if the loop direction is
from the positive terminal toward the negative
terminal.
5. Solve the equations algebraically for the unknowns.
Be careful with signs. At the end, check your answers
by plugging them into the original equations, or
even by using any additional loop or junction rule
equations not used previously.

Kirchhoff’s Rules
1. Label the current in each separate branch of the
given circuit with a different subscript, such as
(see Fig. 19–11 or 19–13). Each current
refers to a segment between two junctions. Choose
the direction of each current, using an arrow. The
direction can be chosen arbitrarily: if the current is
actually in the opposite direction, it will come out
with a minus sign in the solution.
2. Identify the unknowns. You will need as many
independent equations as there are unknowns. You
may write down more equations than this, but you
will find that some of the equations will be redundant
(that is, not be independe
