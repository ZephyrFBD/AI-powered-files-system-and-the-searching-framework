on the rate of respiration. Sample data is shown in the table and in Figure 24.7.

Lab 7: Mitosis and Meiosis
Mitosis is the process of cell division in somatic (body) cells that produces genetically identical daughter cells.
Mitosis is important in asexual reproduction, growth, and tissue repair. Meiosis is the process used in sexually
reproducing organisms to produce haploid gametes. Meiosis ensures that the number of chromosomes remains
consistent from generation to generation while also generating genetic diversity through genetic recombination or
crossing-over. The roles of mitosis and meiosis in a living organismâ€™s life cycle are represented in Figure 24.8.

As in Lab 4, this investigation can be divided into multiple parts, as in the following scenario.
