The genetic information that is passed on from generation to generation in all
living cells is contained in the chromosomes, which are made up of genes. Each
gene contains the information needed to produce a particular type of protein mol-
ecule, and that information is built into the principal molecule of a chromosome,
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), Fig. 16–38. DNA molecules are made up of many
small molecules known as nucleotide bases which are each polar (Section 16–2)
due to unequal sharing of electrons. There are four types of nucleotide bases in
DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
The DNA of a chromosome generally consists of two long DNA strands wrapped
about one another in the shape of a “double helix.” The genetic information is
contained in the specific order of the four bases (A, C, G, T) along each strand. As
shown in Fig. 16–39, the two strands are attracted by electrostatic
