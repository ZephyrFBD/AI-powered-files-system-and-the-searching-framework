s. When a potential difference is applied across
the metal, electrons can respond by accelerating and increasing their energy, since
there are plenty of unoccupied states of slightly higher energy available. Hence,
a current flows readily and sodium is a good conductor. The characteristic of all
good conductors is that the highest energy band is only partially filled, or two
bands overlap so that unoccupied states are available. An example of the latter 
is magnesium, which has two 3s electrons, so its 3s band is filled. But the unfilled
3p band overlaps the 3s band in energy, so there are lots of available states for the
electrons to move into. Thus magnesium, too, is a good conductor.
In a material that is a good insulator, on the other hand, the highest band
containing electrons, called the valence band, is completely filled. The next
highest energy band, called the conduction band, is separated from the valence
band by a “forbidden” energy gap (or band gap),
of typically 5 to 10 eV
