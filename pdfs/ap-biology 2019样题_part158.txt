 and not by sperm; as such, traits 
determined by the mitochondrial DNA are 
maternally inherited.
c. In plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts 
are transmitted in the ovule and not in the 
pollen; as such, mitochondria-determined 
and chloroplast-determined traits are 
maternally inherited.

SUGGESTED SKILL
Concept Explanation
1.C
Explain biological concepts, 
processes, and/or models 
in applied contexts.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-3.B
Explain how the same 
genotype can result in 
multiple phenotypes under 
different environmental 
conditions.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-3.B.1
Environmental factors influence gene 
expression and can lead to phenotypic 
plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity occurs when 
individuals with the same genotype exhibit 
different phenotypes in different environme
