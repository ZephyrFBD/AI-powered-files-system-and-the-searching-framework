the reaction MgCl2(s) ¡ Mg(s) +  
Cl2(g) knowing that the internal energy 
for a mixture of Mg(s) and Cl2(g) is 
larger than that of MgCl2(s).

What is the value of ∆E if Efinal equals Einitial?
Energy lost to surroundings,
internal energy of system 
decreases, DE negative
Energy gained from surroundings,
internal energy of system 
increases, DE positive
