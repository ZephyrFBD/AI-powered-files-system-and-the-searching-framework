een zinc and copper sulfate? (a) Zinc is oxidized, and 
copper ion is reduced. (b) Zinc is reduced, and copper ion is 
oxidized. (c) All reactants and products are soluble strong elec-
trolytes. (d) The oxidation state of copper in copper sulfate is 0. 
(e) More than one of the previous choices are true.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Write the balanced molecular and net ionic equations for 
the reaction between magnesium and cobalt(II) sulfate.  
(b) What is oxidized, and what is reduced in the reaction?
SOLUTION
Analyze We must write two equations—molecular and net ionic—
for the redox reaction between a metal and an acid.
Plan Metals react with acids to form salts and H2 gas. To write the 
balanced equations, we must write the chemical formulas for the two 
reactants and then determine the formula of the salt, which is com-
posed of the cation formed by the metal and the anion of the acid.
Solve The reactants are Al and HBr. The cation formed by Al is Al3+, 
and the anion from hydrobrom
