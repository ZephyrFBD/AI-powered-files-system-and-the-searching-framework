assemblies formed on the synaptonemal complex that mark the points of crossover
events and mediate the multistep process of genetic recombination between non-sister chromatids
nuclear division that produces daughter nuclei each having one-half as many chromosome sets as the
parental nucleus; meiosis I is a reduction division
all the cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells
haploid cell that can produce a haploid multicellular organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell
a multicellular diploid life-cycle stage that produces haploid spores by meiosis
formation of a close association between homologous chromosomes during prophase I
protein lattice that forms between homologous chromosomes during prophase I, supporting
crossover
two duplicated homologous chromosomes (four chromatids) bound together by chiasmata during prophase I
CHAPTER SUMMARY
11.1 The Process of Meiosis
Sexual reproduction requires that diploid organisms produce haploi
