of light entering a gas will emerge with dark
(absorption) lines at frequencies that correspond to emission lines (Fig. 27–23c).
The Bohr theory also ensures the stability of atoms. It establishes stability by
decree: the ground state is the lowest state for an electron and there is no lower
energy level to which it can go and emit more energy. Finally, as we saw above,
the Bohr theory accurately predicts the ionization energy of 13.6 eV for hydro-
gen. However, the Bohr model was not so successful for other atoms, and has
been superseded as we shall discuss in the next Chapter. We discuss the Bohr
model because it was an important start and because we still use the concept of
stationary states, the ground state, and transitions between states. Also, the ter-
minology used in the Bohr model is still used by chemists and spectroscopists.
