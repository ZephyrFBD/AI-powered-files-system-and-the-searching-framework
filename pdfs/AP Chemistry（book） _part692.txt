▲ Figure 5.3 Electrostatic potential energy and ionic bonding. As the separation between 
ions increases, the electrostatic potential energy increases (becomes less negative). As 
the distance separating the ions goes toward infinity, the electrostatic potential energy goes to 
zero. In real compounds, repulsions between core electrons place a lower limit on how closely the 
ions can approach each other.

If the ions in the figure on the right were released and allowed 
to move, would they move closer together or farther apart?

change that accompanies a chemical reaction in a laboratory, the reactants and products con-
stitute the system. The container and everything beyond it are considered the surroundings.
Systems may be open, closed, or isolated. An open system is one in which matter and 
energy can be exchanged with the surroundings. An uncovered pot of boiling water on a 
stove is an open system: Heat
