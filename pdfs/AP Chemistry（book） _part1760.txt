h two opposing processes occur simulta-
neously at equal rates is called dynamic equilibrium (or simply 
equilibrium). Chemical equilibrium, which we encountered in Sec-
tion 4.1, is a kind of dynamic equilibrium in which the opposing 
processes are chemical reactions.
A liquid and its vapor are in dynamic equilibrium when evap-
oration and condensation occur at equal rates. It may appear 
that nothing is occurring at equilibrium because there is no net 
change in the system. In fact, though, a great deal is happening 
as molecules continuously pass from liquid state to gas state and 
from gas state to liquid state. The vapor pressure of a liquid is the 
pressure exerted by its vapor when the liquid and vapor are in dynamic 
equilibrium.
Volatility, Vapor Pressure, and temperature
When vaporization occurs in an open container, as when water 
evaporates from a bowl, the vapor moves away from the liquid. 
Little, if any, is recaptured at the surface of the liquid. Equilibrium
