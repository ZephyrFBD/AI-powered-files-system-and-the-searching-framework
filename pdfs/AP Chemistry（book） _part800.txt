ling our future energy needs will depend on developing technology to harness 
solar energy with greater efficiency. Solar energy is the world’s largest energy source. On 
a clear day about 1 kJ of solar energy reaches each square meter of Earth’s surface every 
second. The average solar energy falling on only 0.1% of U.S. land area is equivalent to all 
the energy this nation currently uses. Harnessing this energy is difficult because it is dilute 
(that is, distributed over a wide area) and varies with time of day and weather conditions. 
The effective use of solar energy will depend on the development of some means of storing 
and distributing it. One practical way to do this is to use the Sun’s energy to drive an endo-
thermic chemical process that can be later reversed to release heat. One such reaction is
CH41g2 + H2O1g2 + heat ¡  CO1g2 + 3 H21g2
This reaction proceeds in the forward direction at high temperatures, which can be ob-
tained in a solar furnace. The CO and H2 formed i
