B. Describe the role for serotonin that is indicated across
domains.
C. Evaluate the effect that stress produces in serotonin
production, the association of stress with functional
dyspepsia, and the role of serotonin in the regulation of
expression in smooth muscle cells in terms of evidence of
a negative feedback produced by serotonin as a
medication.
D. Justify your evaluation of the stress and the role of
serotonin as a response to the stress in the form of a
feedback loop diagrammatically.
Quorum sensing coordinates bacterial expression,
stimulating virulence factors, and behavior, inducing the
formation of biofilms. Knecht et al. (EBioMedicine, 9,
