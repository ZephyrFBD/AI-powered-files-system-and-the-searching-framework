 look up the redox potentials to 
see which ion, BrO3
  - or ClO3
  -, has the larger reduction potential. The 
ion with the larger reduction potential is the stronger oxidizing agent. 
BrO3
  - is the stronger oxidizing agent on this basis (+1.52 V standard 
reduction potential in acid compared to +1.47 V for ClO3
  -).

(gas) Figure 1.5 Molecules of a compound are composed of 
more than one type of atom, and molecules of an element are com-
posed of only one type of atom. Figure 1.6 It would get larger 
because hydrogen atoms are lighter than the atoms of any other 
element. Figure 1.7 (c) Each water molecule contains one oxygen 
atom and two hydrogen atoms. Figure 1.14 The separations are
