they live thousands of miles apart, these two animals live in similar

(C) 3,942 children had the disease out of a total of 9,851 children.
Therefore, 40% of the children are afflicted, and 40% = 0.40 = q2. If
q2 = 0.40, then q = 0.63. If q = 0.63, then p = 0.37. To determine
what percentage of those without the disease are carriers, that is 2(p)
(q) = 2(.37)(.63) = 0.47 or 47%. (EVO-1 & SP 5)
(C) The essence of this question is the fact that the more genetic
variation there is in any population, the more that population will be
able to withstand changes or pressure from the environment. (EVO-
