Answers and Explanations
Multiple-Choice Questions
1. C. Chemical evolution was able to occur because highly reactive oxygen was not present. The production of
oxygen from photosynthesis ended abiotic synthesis because oxygen interfered with the abiotic chemical reactions.
Also, the oxygen interacted with UV light to form the ozone layer, which absorbed most incoming UV, the major
energy source for abiotic reactions.
2. D. Only natural selection generates adaptations. Changes in gene frequencies from other factors may contribute to
increases in fitness
