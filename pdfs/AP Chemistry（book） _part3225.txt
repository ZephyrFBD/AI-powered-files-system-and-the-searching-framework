ulate from the concentration 
of H+, a reactant.
Plan We write the equation for the cell reaction and use standard 
reduction potentials to calculate E° for the reaction. After deter-
mining the value of n from our reaction equation, we solve the 
Nernst equation, Equation 20.18, for Q. We use the equation for 
the cell reaction to write an expression for Q that contains 3H+4 to 
determine 3H+4. Finally, we use 3H+4 to calculate pH.
Calculate the emf at 298 K generated by a voltaic cell in which the reaction is
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + 14 H+1aq2 + 6 I-1aq2 ¡ 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 3 I21s2 + 7 H2O1l2
when
3Cr2O7
2-4 = 2.0 M, 3H+4 = 1.0 M, 3I-4 = 1.0 M, and 3Cr3+4 = 1.0 * 10-5 M

Cell Potential under Nonstandard Conditions
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a chemical equation for a voltaic cell and the 
concentrations of reactants and products under which it operates. 
We are asked to calculate the emf of the cell under these nonstan-
dard conditions.
