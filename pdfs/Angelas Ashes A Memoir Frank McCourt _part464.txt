n the sugar bowl was on the toilet 
 
  
  
 bowl, or what’s left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they 
 
 find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have 
 
 the fleas. Mam says there’s one good thing about fleas, they’re clean, but 
 
 flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry 
 
 diseases galore. 
 
 We can chase the rats and kill them.We can slap at the flies and the 
 
 fleas and kill them but there’s nothing we can do about the neighbors 
 
 and their buckets. If we’re out in the lane playing and we see someone 
 
 with a bucket we call to our own house,Bucket coming, close the door, 
 
 close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather 
 
 we run to close the door all day because we know which families have 
 
 the worst buckets.There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they 
 
 get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will 
 
 stink to the heavens and make us sick.
