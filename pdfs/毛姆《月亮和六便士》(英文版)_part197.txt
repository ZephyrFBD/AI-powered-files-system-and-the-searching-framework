't bear the sight of him. It was more than 
improbable; it was incredible. I thought it was merely jealousy. You see, I've always been jealous, 
but I trained myself never to show it; I was jealous of every man she knew; I was jealous of you. I 
knew she didn't love me as I loved her. That was only natural, wasn't it? But she allowed me to 
love her, and that was enough to make me happy. I forced myself to go out for hours together in 
order to leave them by themselves; I wanted to punish myself for suspicions which were unworthy 
of me; and when I came back I found they didn't want me -- not Strickland, he didn't care if I was 
there or not, but Blanche. She shuddered when I went to kiss her. When at last I was certain I 
didn't know what to do; I knew they'd only laugh at me if I made a scene. I thought if I held my 
tongue and pretended not to see, everything would come right. I made up my mind to get him 
away quietly, without quarrelling. Oh, if you only knew what I've suffered!"
