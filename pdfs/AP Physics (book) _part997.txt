29. (III) A door 2.30 m high and 1.30 m wide has a mass of
13.0 kg. A hinge 0.40 m from the top and another hinge
0.40 m from the bottom each support half the door’s weight
(Fig.9–69). Assume that the center
of gravity is at the geometrical
center of the door, and determine
the horizontal and vertical force
components exerted by each hinge
on the door.
*30. (III) A uniform ladder of mass m and length 
leans at an angle 
against a frictionless wall,
Fig. 9–70. If the coefficient of static friction
between the ladder and the ground is 
determine a formula for the minimum
angle at which the ladder will not slip.
