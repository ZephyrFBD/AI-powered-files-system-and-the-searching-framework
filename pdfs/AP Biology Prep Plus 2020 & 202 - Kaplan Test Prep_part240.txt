the results of an experiment that
examined the percent of petunia roots colonized by mycorrhizae
in environments with diﬀerent amounts of phosphate (PO43–).
Which of the following provides the most plausible interpretation
of the graph?
Adapted from Eva Nouri et al., “Phosphorus and Nitrogen
Regulate Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis in Petunia
hybrid,” PLoS ONE 9, no. 3 (March 2014): e90841.
Petunias can take up more phosphate when they have
mycorrhizae, so they are less likely to benefit from
mycorrhizal colonization when there is plenty of phosphate
available.
(A)
Petunias under stress from high or low phosphate levels are
less able to form associations with mycorrhizae than those at
healthy phosphate levels.
(B)
The pattern in the graph is unclear, so another abiotic factor
not measured is probably responsible for the change in
percent root colonization with changing phosphate
concentration.
(C)
Increased phosphate levels inhibit mycorrhizal growth,
making them less available to col
