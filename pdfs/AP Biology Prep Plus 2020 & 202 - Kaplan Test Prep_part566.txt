Answers and Explanations
TEST WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
1. D
Learning Objective: 13.1
RNA contains phosphate, the sugar ribose, and the nitrogenous bases
adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. Only (D) includes the
appropriate sugar and an appropriate RNA base that is distinct from
the bases of DNA. (A) and (B) are incorrect because they contain the
sugar deoxyribose, a component of DNA. (C) is incorrect because RNA
does not contain thymine, a base found only in DNA.
2. B
Learning Objective: 13.2
Because the lac– cells contain everything necessary to construct
enzymes that can ferment lactose except for the DNA with the lac+
genes, the only cells that would be adversely aﬀected would be those
incubated with extract B, which loses those genes due to the action of
the DNases. Because those cells would be unable to f
