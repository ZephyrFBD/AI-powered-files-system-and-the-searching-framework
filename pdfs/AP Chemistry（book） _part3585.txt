to make solar cells and transistors for computer chips. To be 
used as a semiconductor, it must be extremely pure, possessing less than 10 - 7% (1 ppb) 
impurities. One method of purification is to treat the element with Cl2 to form SiCl4, a 
volatile liquid that is purified by fractional distillation and then converted back to ele-
mental silicon by reduction with H2:
 
SiCl41g2 + 2 H21g2 ¡ Si1s2 + 4 HCl1g2 
[22.67]
The process known as zone refining can further purify the element (Figure 22.31). As a 
heated coil is passed slowly along a silicon rod, a narrow band of the element is melted. As 
the molten section is swept slowly along the length of the rod, the impurities concentrate 
in this section, following it to the end of the rod. The purified top portion of the rod crys-
tallizes as 99.999999999% pure silicon.
Silicates
Silicon dioxide and other compounds that contain silicon and oxygen make up over 90% 
of Earth’s crust. In silicates, a silicon atom is surrounded by four oxyge
