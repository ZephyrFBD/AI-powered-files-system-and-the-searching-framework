 called the principal quantum number. It can have any
integer value from 1 to 
The total energy of a state in the hydrogen atom
depends on n, as we saw above.
(2) The orbital quantum number,
is related to the magnitude of the angular
momentum of the electron;
can take on integer values from 0 to 
For the ground state,
can only be zero.† For
can be 0, 1, or 2.
The actual magnitude of the angular momentum L is related to the quantum
number by
(28;3)
(where again 
). The value of has almost no effect on the total energy
in the hydrogen atom; only n does to any appreciable extent (but see fine
structure below). In atoms with two or more electrons, the energy does depend
on as well as n, as we shall see.
(3) The magnetic quantum number,
is related to the direction of the electron’s
angular momentum, and it can take on integer values ranging from 
to 
For example, if 
then 
can be 
or 
Since angular
momentum is a vector, it is not surprising that both its magnitude and its direc-
tion would
