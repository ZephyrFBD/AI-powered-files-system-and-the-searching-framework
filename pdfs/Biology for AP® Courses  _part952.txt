he Calvin cycle.) After three turns of the
cycle, a three-carbon molecule of G3P leaves the cycle to become part of a carbohydrate molecule. The remaining G3P
molecules stay in the cycle to be regenerated into RuBP, which is then ready to react with more incoming CO2. In other
words, the cell generates a stockpile of G3P to be assembled into organic molecules, including carbohydrates. Each step of
the Calvin cycle is catalyzed by specific enzymes. (You do not have to memorize the reactions of the Calvin cycle; however,
if provided with a diagram of the cycle, you should be able to interpret it.) Some plants evolved chemical modifications to
more efficiently trap CO2 if environmental conditions limit its availability. For example, when itâ€™s hot outside, plants tend
to keep their stomata closed to prevent excessive water loss; when the outside temperature cools, stomata open and plants
take in CO2 and use a more efficient system to feed it into the Calvin cycle.
