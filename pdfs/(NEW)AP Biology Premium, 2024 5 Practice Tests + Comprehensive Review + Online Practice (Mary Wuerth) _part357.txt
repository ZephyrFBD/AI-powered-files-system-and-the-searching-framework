on. On the opposite
strand of the double helix that is oriented in the 5′ to 3′ direction, DNA polymerase must work in the opposite
direction, performing replication discontinuously. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are all incorrect statements.
8. (A) Helicase unwinds the double helix of DNA, and topoisomerase relieves the stress caused by the
supercoiling (created when helicase unwinds the DNA). Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because DNA
polymerase adds new nucleotides; it does not have an unwinding function. Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect
because ligase joins together short segments of DNA created on the lagging strand by discontinuous replication.
9. (C) DNA polymerase adds new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand, and ligase joins the discontinuous
segments of DNA on the lagging strand together. Choice (A) is incorrect because helicase unwinds the DNA
double helix and topoisomerase relieves the supercoiling created by this unwinding. Since topoisomerase
relieves supercoiling, choi
