: In this part of the investigation, the movement of water in plant cells is measured. Cubes of potato (or any
other root vegetable) of identical sizes are made and then massed. Each cube is placed in a solution with a different
concentration of sucrose (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 molar). Plant cells have a cell wall in addition to a cell
membrane, so these cubes are placed in the solutions at least overnight to allow for movement of water between the
plant cells and their environment. Then each cube is removed from the solution and massed, and the percent change
in mass is calculated. Cubes with a higher water potential than the surrounding solution are expected to lose water to
their environment and therefore have a negative percent change in mass. Cubes with a lower water potential than the
surrounding solution are expected to gain water from their environment and therefore have a positive percent change
in mass. A graph is made plotting the molarity of each solution on the x-
