In animal cells, the centrosomes contain small cylindrical bodies called centrioles.
The centrosomes move to opposite sides of the cell.
Spindle fibers, made of microtubules, radiate outward from the centrosomes and some, called
kinetochore fibers, attach to each chromosome at its centromere.
2. Metaphase—During metaphase, the chromatids line up across the center of the cell which is called the
metaphase plate.
3. Anaphase—Chromatids separate from one another during anaphase, at which point each chromatid is
now considered to be an individual chromosome.
i.
The centromeres of the chromatids split.
ii. The kinetochore fibers pull one copy of each chromosome to one pole and the rest to the other side
of the cell.
4. Telophase—the last stage of mitosis.
i.
The mitotic spindle disassembles.
ii. The chromosomes unwind from their highly compacted state.
iii. A new nuclear membrane forms and surrounds each new complete set of chromosomes.
