 chosen because it concentrates in the organ or
region of the anatomy to be studied. Detectors outside the body then record, or
image, the distribution of the radioactively labeled compound. The detection
could be done by a single detector (Fig. 31–20a) which is moved across the body,
measuring the intensity of radioactivity at a large number of points. The image
represents the relative intensity of radioactivity at each point. The relative
radioactivity is a diagnostic tool. For example, high or low radioactivity may
represent overactivity or underactivity of an organ or part of an organ, or in
another case may represent a lesion or tumor. More complex gamma cameras
make use of many detectors which simultaneously record the radioactivity at
many points. The measured intensities can be displayed on a TV or computer
monitor. The image is sometimes called a scintigram (after scintillator),

limited—by non-perfe
