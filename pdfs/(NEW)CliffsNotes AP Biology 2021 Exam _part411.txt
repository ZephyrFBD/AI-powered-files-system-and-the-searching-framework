HbA, HbAHbS, and HbSHbS. HbAHbA individuals are
 
normal, while HbSHbS individuals suffer from sickle-cell disease, because the sickle-cell allele produces
hemoglobin with an impaired oxygen-carrying ability. Without medical intervention, most HbSHbS individuals die
early in life. The
heterozygote HbAHbS individuals are generally healthy, but their oxygen-carrying ability may be significantly
reduced during strenuous exercise or exposure to low oxygen concentrations (such as at high altitudes). Despite fatal
effects to homozygote
HbSHbS individuals and reduced viability of heterozygote individuals, the frequency of the HbAHbS condition
exceeds 14% in parts of Africa, an unusually high value for a deleterious
phenotype. However, heterozygote HbAHbS individuals have a selective advantage (in Africa) because the HbAHbS
trait also provides resistance to malaria. When HbAHbS phenotypes are
selected, both HbA and HbS alleles are preserved in the gene pool, and all three phenotypes are mainta
