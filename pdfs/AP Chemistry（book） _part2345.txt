 (b) What is the 
value of the rate constant with proper units? (c) What is 
the reaction rate when the initial concentration of HgCl2 
is 0.100 M and that of C2O4
2- is 0.25 M if the temperature 
is the same as that used to obtain the data shown?

 (a) What is the rate law for this reaction? (b) What is the 
value of the rate constant with proper units? (c) What is 
the reaction rate when the initial concentration of X is 
0.75 M and that of Z is 1.25 M?
 14.95  The reaction 2 NO2 ¡ 2 NO + O2 has the rate con-
stant k = 0.63 M - 1s - 1. (a) Based on the units for k, is the 
reaction ﬁrst or second order in NO2? (b) If the initial con-
centration of NO2 is 0.100 M, how would you determine 
how long it would take for the concentration to decrease 
to 0.025 M?
