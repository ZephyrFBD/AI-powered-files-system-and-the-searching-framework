Figure 16.6 DNA is folded around histone proteins to create (a) nucleosome complexes. These nucleosomes control
the access of proteins to the underlying DNA. When viewed through an electron microscope (b), the nucleosomes look
like beads on a string. (credit “micrograph”: modification of work by Chris Woodcock)
If DNA encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into RNA, the nucleosomes surrounding that region of DNA can slide
down the DNA to open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase)
to initiate transcription (Figure 16.7). Nucleosomes can move to open the chromosome structure to expose a segment of
DNA, but do so in a very controlled manner.
