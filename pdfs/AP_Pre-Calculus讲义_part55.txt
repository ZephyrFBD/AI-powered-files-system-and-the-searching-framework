t, then apply f to the result.

The h machine is composed of the g machine (first) and then the f machine. 
 
Given two functions f and g, the composite function (also called the composition of f and 
g) is defined by 
 
The domain of f(g(x))is the set of all x in the domain of g such that g(x) is in the domain of 
f. In other words, f(g(x)) is defined whenever both g(x) and f(g(x)) are defined. 
We can picture f(g(x)) using an arrow diagram. 
 
Example 2 
Let f(x) = x2 and g(x) = x -3. 
(a) Find the functions f(g(x)) and g(f(x)). 
(b) Find f(g(5)) and g(f(7)).

2.4.3 Application of Composite Functions

When working with functions that model real-world situations, we name the variables using 
letters that suggest the quantity being modeled. We may use t for time, d for distance, V 
for volume, and so on.

A ship is traveling at 20 mi/h parallel to a straight shoreline. The ship is 5 mi from shore. It 
passes a lighthouse at n
