um, and iron ions—so-called hard water. Heated 
hard water can cause problems by forming deposits inside of pipes, 
reducing flow over time. Hard water can be “softened” by passing 
it through zeolites containing sodium ions that are replaced or ex-
changed for calcium ions in the hard water. Periodic flushing of the 
zeolite with an aqueous solution containing a high concentration 
of sodium ions removes the calcium ions and renews the zeolite for 
further use.

Although it was not fully understood, people have known for hundreds of years that 
metals are different when they are very finely divided. Dating back to the Middle Ages, 
the makers of stained-glass windows knew that gold dispersed in molten glass made the
