l ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the 
 
 bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to 
 
 us and isn’t it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there 
 
 and save the arse of the ancient foe.

 The women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, 
 
 The first telegram money order I get I’ll be in the shop buying a big 
 
 breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning. 
 
 I look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of 
 
 a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it 
 
 around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter 
 
 down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop,more 
 
 salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it 
 
 must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything 
 
 in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden 
 
 tea?
