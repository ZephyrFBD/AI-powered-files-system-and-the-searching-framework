Simple Learned Behaviors
The majority of the behaviors previously discussed were innate or at least have an innate component (variations on
the innate behaviors may be learned). They are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from
the environment. Conversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism

habituation and imprintingâ€”both are important to the maturation process of young animals.
Habituation
Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of
