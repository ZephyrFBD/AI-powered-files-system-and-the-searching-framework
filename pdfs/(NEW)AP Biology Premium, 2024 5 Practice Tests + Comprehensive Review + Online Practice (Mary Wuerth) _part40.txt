 – 1 = 1.
3. Using a df of 1 and a p-value of 0.05, the critical value is 3.84 according to the chi-square table.
4. Compare your calculated chi-square value to the critical value. The calculated chi-square value (6.40) is
greater than the critical value (3.84).
5. Decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or whether you fail to reject the null hypothesis. In this example,
you should reject the null hypothesis because the calculated chi-square value is greater than the critical value.
Since the null hypothesis is rejected, you can then come up with an alternative hypothesis—for example,
perhaps this is a “trick coin”!
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics are used to describe data sets. There are descriptive statistics that describe the center of a data
set, and other descriptive statistics describe the amount of variability or spread of a data set.
The mean and median can be used to characterize the center of a data set. Thus, the mean and median are
sometimes referred to a
