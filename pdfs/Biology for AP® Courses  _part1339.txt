 mutations that result in dominant lethal
alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form. Dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the
allele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted. However, just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately
manifest the phenotype of death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood. Once the individual
reaches reproductive age, the allele may be unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations. An
example of this in humans is Huntington’s disease, in which the nervous system gradually wastes away (Figure 12.14).
People who are heterozygous for the dominant Huntington allele (Hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease. However,
the onset of Huntington’s disease may not occur until age 40, at which point the afflicted persons may have already passed
the allele to 50 percent of their offspring.
