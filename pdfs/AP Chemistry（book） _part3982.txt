A-3
mass of products = 0.855 g + 0.347 g = 1.202 g.  
Mass is conserved, within the precision of the data. 
3.65  (a) Al2S31s2 + 6 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 Al1OH231s2 + 3 H2S1g2
(b) 14.7 g Al1OH23 3.67 (a) 2.25 mol N2 (b) 15.5 g NaN3  
(c) 548 g NaN3 3.69 (a) 5.50 *  10-3 mol Al (b) 1.47 g AlBr3  
3.71 1.25 * 105  kJ 3.73  (a) The limiting reactant determines the 
maximum number of product moles resulting from a chemical reac-
tion; any other reactant is an excess reactant. (b) The limiting reactant 
regulates the amount of products because it is completely used up 
during the reaction; no more product can be made when one of the 
reactants is unavailable. (c) Combining ratios are molecule and mole 
ratios. Since different molecules have different masses, comparing ini-
tial masses of reactants will not provide a comparison of numbers of 
molecul
