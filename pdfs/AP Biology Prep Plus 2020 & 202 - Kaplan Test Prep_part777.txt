ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND INVASIVE SPECIES
Changes in the environment, such as environmental catastrophes,
geological events, and the sudden influx/depletion of abiotic resources,
also aï¬€ect the behavioral responses of organisms. An environmental
catastrophe or disaster due to human activity (like deforestation or
overhunting) puts extraordinary pressures on organisms and may result
in the loss of species or the selection for altered behavioral traits.
Geological events such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes may also
result in the extinction of species. Geologically separating a population
(for instance, by the formation of a mountain range) can lead to changes
in diversity. Changing the abiotic environment can alter the nutrient
availability of a community, which determines whether a species can
invade and/or persist in a community. A flood may bring an influx of
nutrients, while a drought will diminish the availability o
