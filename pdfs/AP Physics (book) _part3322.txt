and (ii) when they are in the molecule. Take
for the electrons in the separated atoms to be the
radius of the first Bohr orbit, 0.053 nm, and for the mole-
cule take 
to be the separation of the nuclei, 0.074 nm.

39. The average translational kinetic energy of an atom or
molecule is about 
(see Section 13–9), where
is Boltzmann’s constant. At what
temperature T will 
be on the order of the bond energy
(and hence the bond easily broken by thermal motion) for
(a) a covalent bond (say 
) of binding energy 4.0 eV, and
(b) a “weak” hydrogen bond of binding energy 0.12 eV?
40. A diatomic molecule is found to have an activation energy
of 1.3 eV. When the molecule is disassociated, 1.6 eV of
energy is released. Draw a potential energy curve for this
molecule.
41. In the ionic salt KF, the separation distance between ions
is about 0.27 nm. (a) Estimate the electrostatic potential
energy between the ions assuming them to be point
charges (magnitude 1e). (b) When F “grabs” an electr
