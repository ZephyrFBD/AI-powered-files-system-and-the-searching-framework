hich exerts a greater repulsion (Figure 9.7).
Comment Because the nonbonding domain is larger than the 
bonding domains, we predict that the four F atoms in the 
base of the pyramid will be tipped up slightly toward the top F 
atom. Experimentally, we find that the angle between the base 
atoms and the top F atom is 82°, smaller than the ideal 90° an-
gle of an octahedron.

The iodine has six electron domains around it, one of which 
is nonbonding. The electron-domain geometry is therefore 
octahedral, with one position occupied by the nonbonding 
pair, and the molecular geometry is square pyramidal
