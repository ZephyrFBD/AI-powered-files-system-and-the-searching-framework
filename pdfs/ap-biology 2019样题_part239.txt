learning objectives is important for student success. 
Selecting experiments that provide students with the 
broadest laboratory experience possible is important 
when designing the course. You should plan to devote 
25 percent of instructional time to lab investigations 
and have students conduct at least two investigations 
per big idea.
some of the investigations in the lab manual. None of 
the investigations in the lab manual require the use 
of probes or computer sensors for data collection, 
though they can be used if available. It is recommended 
that instructors have a computer and projector to 
show computer-based animations and simulations for 
pre-lab activities or post-lab discussions. However, a

equipment is unavailable. Students may use computers 
or graphing calculators to analyze data and present 
their findings, but they do not need to do so.
