ter. Galileo is often called the “father of modern science,” not only
for the content of his science (astronomical discoveries, inertia, free fall) but
also for his new methods of doing science (idealization and simplification, mathe-
matization of theory, theories that have testable consequences, experiments to test
theoretical predictions).

his argument for the action of gravity being uniform acceleration. He used an inclined
plane to slow down the action. A ball rolling down the plane still accelerates.
Tiny bells placed at equal distances along the inclined plane would ring at shorter
time intervals as the ball “fell,” indicating that the speed was increasing.

of a falling apple, at equal time 
intervals. The apple falls farther 
during each successive interval,
which means it is accelerating.
