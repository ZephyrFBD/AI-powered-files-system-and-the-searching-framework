t, Kc, for the reaction CoO1s2 + CO1g2 ∆Co1s2 
+ CO21g2 at 823 K. (b) Based on your answer to part 
(a), would you say that carbon monoxide is a stronger or 
weaker reducing agent than H2 at T = 823 K? (c) If you 
were to place 5.00 g of CoO1s2 in a sealed tube with a vol-
ume of 250 mL that contains CO1g2 at a pressure of 1.00 
atm and a temperature of 298 K, what is the concentra-
tion of the CO gas?  Assume there is no reaction at this 
temperature and that the CO behaves as an ideal gas (you 
can neglect the volume of the solid). (d) If the reaction 
vessel from part (c) is heated to 823 K and allowed to 
come to equilibrium, how much CoO1s2 remains?
 [15.97] Consider the equilibrium A ∆ B in which both the 
forward and reverse reactions are elementary (single-step) 
reactions. Assume that the only effect of a catalyst on the 
reaction is to lower the activation energies of the forward 
and reverse reactions, as shown in Figure 15.15. Using the 
Arrhenius equation (Section 14.5), p
