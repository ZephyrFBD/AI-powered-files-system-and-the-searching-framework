Connection for AP® Courses
Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. The methods of
fertilization described in this section are not within the scope for AP®. However, from an evolutionary perspective, it is
important to note that animals exhibit means of both external fertilization and internal fertilization, likely determined by
their environment.
