 area, providing more opportunity for
nutrients to be obtained and absorbed.
b.
a. The digestive tract shown at the top belongs to
the herbivore. b. Herbivores have a longer
intestinal tract, which provides more opportunity
for nutrients to be obtained and absorbed, since
plant material is difficult for animals to break
down.
c.
a. The digestive tract shown at the bottom
belongs to the herbivore. b. Herbivores have a
longer intestinal tract, which provides more
opportunity for the nutrients to react with the
intestinal enzymes for better absorption, since
plant material is difficult for animals to break
down.
d.
a. The digestive tract shown at the bottom
belongs to the herbivore. b. Herbivores have a
shorter intestinal tract, which provides more
opportunity for nutrients to be obtained and
absorbed, since plant material is difficult for
animals to break down.
