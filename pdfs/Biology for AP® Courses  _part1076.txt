9.3 Response to the Signal
The initiation of a signaling pathway is a response to external stimuli. This response can take many different forms,
including protein synthesis, a change in the cellâ€™s metabolism, cell growth, or even cell death. Many pathways influence
the cell by initiating gene expression, and the methods utilized are quite numerous. Some pathways activate enzymes that
interact with DNA transcription factors. Others modify proteins and induce them to change their location in the cell.
Depending on the status of the organism, cells can respond by storing energy as glycogen or fat, or making it available in
the form of glucose. A signal transduction pathway allows muscle cells to respond to immediate requirements for energy
in the form of glucose. Cell growth is almost always
