resenting the solid–liquid equilibrium rises nearly vertically from the triple point. It is 
easy to see in Figure 13.21 that the triple-point temperature of the solution is lower than 
that of the pure liquid, but it is also true for all points along the solid–liquid equilibrium 
curve: the freezing point of the solution is lower than that of the pure liquid.
Like the boiling-point elevation, the change in freezing point ∆T
f is directly propor-
tional to solute molality, taking into account the van’t Hoff factor i:
 
∆T
f = T
f 1solution2 -  T
f 1solvent2 = -iKf m 
[13.13]
The proportionality constant Kf is the molal freezing-point-depression constant, 
analogous to Kb for boiling-point elevation. Note that because the solution freezes at a 
lower temperature than does the pure solvent, the value of ∆T
f is negative.
Some typical values of Kb and Kf for several common solvents are given in Table 13.3. 
For water, the table shows Kb = 0.51 °C>m, which means that the boiling point of
