I’ll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and 
 
 a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the 
 
 world.We’ll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in 
 
 a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk 
 
 and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, 
 
 toast with butter and marmalade galore.We’ll take our time and listen 
 
 to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I’ll 
 
 buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won’t be hanging 
 
 out of our pants and we won’t have the shame. The thought of the 
 
 shame brings a pain in my heart and starts me sniffling.The Abbot says, 
 
 What’s up with you? Didn’t you have your bread? Didn’t you have your 
 
 tay? What more do you want? ’Tis an egg you’ll be lookin’ for next. 
 
 There’s no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head 
 
 and sells papers for a living.
