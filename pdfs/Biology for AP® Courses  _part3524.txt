After depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. This is called repolarization, during which voltage-
gated sodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma membrane
sodiumâ€“potassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is
restored. The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or
muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the
membrane cannot generate another action potential. . The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to
return to their resting configurations. The sodium potassiu
