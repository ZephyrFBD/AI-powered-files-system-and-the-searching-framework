a spectator ion in 
the reaction. The net ionic equation is
Mg1s2 + Fe2 +1aq2 ¡ Mg2 +1aq2 + Fe1s2
The net ionic equation shows that Mg is oxidized and Fe2+ is  
reduced in this reaction.
Check Note that the net ionic equation is balanced with respect  
to both charge and mass.

4.5 ∣ Concentrations of Solutions
Scientists use the term concentration to designate the amount of solute dissolved in a 
given quantity of solvent or quantity of solution. The greater the amount of solute dis-
solved in a certain amount of solvent, the more conce
