nction may have occurred over a relatively long period of time. It appears to have affected marine
species and not the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats. The causes of this extinction are poorly understood.
The end-Permian extinction was the largest in the history of life. Indeed, an argument could be made that Earth nearly
became devoid of life during this extinction event. The planet looked very different before and after this event. Estimates are
that 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial species were lost. It was at this time, for example, that
the trilobites, a group that survived the Ordovicianâ€“Silurian extinction, became extinct. The causes for this mass extinction
are not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic activity that led to a runaway global-warming
event. The oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life. Terrestrial tetrapod diversity took 30 million years to
recover after the end-Permian e
