e not allowed to stay in the job beyond 
 
 the age of sixteen.There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, 
 
 and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses.There are no 
 
  
  
 waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops. 
 
 Mrs. O’Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and 
 
 pouch. She says there’s a great shortage of bicycles so I’ll have to walk 
 
 my first batch of telegrams. I’m to go to the farthest address first,work 
 
 my way back, and don’t take all day. She’s long enough in the post office 
 
 to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I’m not 
 
 to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if 
 
 I do I’ll be found out. I’m not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. 
 
 If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no 
 
 attention. Deliver the telegrams and don’t be a sissy. 
 
 One telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Art
