ith the speeds 
of a dropped ball.
APPROACH Again we use Eq. 2–11b, but now 
is not zero, it is
SOLUTION (a) At
the position of the ball as given by Eq. 2–11b is
At
(time interval
to
), the position is
As expected, the ball falls farther each second than if it were dropped with
(b) The velocity is obtained from Eq. 2–11a:
[at

In Example 2–10, when the ball was dropped  
the first term 
in
these equations was zero, so

[at

NOTE For both Examples 2–10 and 2–11, the speed increases linearly in time by
during each second. But the speed of the downwardly thrown ball at
any instant is always 
(its initial speed) higher than that of a dropped ball.
Ball thrown upward. A person throws a ball upward
into the air with an initial velocity of 
Calculate how high it goes. Ignore
air resistance.
APPROACH We are not concerned here with the throwing action, but only
with the motion of the ball after it leaves the thrower’s hand (Fig. 2–23) and
until it comes back to the hand again.
