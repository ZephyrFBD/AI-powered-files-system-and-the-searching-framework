individuals for one gene. A mating of this kind is called a monohybrid
cross.

Typically, the gametes of the sperm are recorded along the leȇ side of the
Punnett square, and those of the egg are recorded across the top. The
allele from each sperm is paired with the allele from each egg where the
columns and rows meet, showing the genotypes of the oﬀspring. The
diﬀerent indications of Aa and aA are used only to demonstrate the
source of the alleles; they are the same genotype.
This cross results in three diﬀerent genotypes (AA, Aa, and aa), but only
two phenotypes because the dominant trait is expressed in both the AA
and Aa individuals. The dominant trait shows up in the oﬀspring in a ratio
of 3 to 1.
You can put together a dihybrid cross (tracking two genes—A and B—
rather than one) just as easily as a monohybrid cross. Just put the
gametes of the male in the leȇ column and the gametes of the female
across the top.
