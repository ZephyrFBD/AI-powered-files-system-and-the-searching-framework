required to synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The 
body uses ATP as an energy source to drive other reactions 
(Section 19.7). At pH 7.0 the following reduction potentials 
pertain to this oxidation of CyFe2+:
O21g2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 4 e- ¡ 2 H2O1l2        E°
red = +0.82 V
CyFe3+1aq2 + e- ¡ CyFe2+1aq2  
E°
red = +0.22 V
(a) What is ∆G for the oxidation of CyFe2+ by air? (b) If the 
synthesis of 1.00 mol of ATP from adenosine diphosphate 
(ADP) requires a ∆G of 37.7 kJ, how many moles of ATP are 
synthesized per mole of O2?
 
[20.117]  The standard potential for the reduction of AgSCN(s) is 
+0.09 V.
AgSCN1s2 + e- ¡ Ag1s2 + SCN-1aq2
Using this value and the electrode potential for Ag+1aq2, 
calculate the Ksp for AgSCN.
 
[20.118]  The Ksp value for PbS(s) is 8.0 * 10-28. By using this value 
together with an electrode potential from Appendix E, 
determine the value of the standard reduction potential for 
the reaction
PbS1s2 + 2 e- ¡ Pb1s2 + S2-1aq2
