re is no source of emf and negligible resistance in the connecting wires.
Next, as the charge passes through the 
resistor to get to point b, there
is a decrease in potential of
The positive
test charge is flowing “downhill” since it is heading toward the negative terminal
of the battery, as indicated in the graph of Fig. 19–12b. Because this is a decrease
in potential, we use a negative sign:
As the charge proceeds from b to c there is another potential decrease (a “voltage
drop”) of
and this too is a decrease in potential:
There is no change in potential as our test charge moves from c to d as we assume
negligible resistance in the wires.
The sum of all the changes in potential around the circuit of Fig. 19–12 is
This is exactly what Kirchhoff’s loop rule said it would be.
