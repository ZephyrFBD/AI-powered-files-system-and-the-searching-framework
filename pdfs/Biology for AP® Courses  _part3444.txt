mobility. In severe cases in
which the joint has suffered extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed.
Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement
surgery in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also
available. Even with this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design of prostheses. The state-of-the-art

prostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young or active individuals.
The field of robotic prosthesis focuses on prosthetics that are attached directly to the skeleton and can be controlled by the
mind by using implanted neuromuscular interfaces. You can read more about this exciting research at the Science Daily
