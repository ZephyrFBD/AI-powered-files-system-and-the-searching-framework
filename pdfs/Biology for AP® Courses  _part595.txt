um ions inside the cell.
d.
ATP is required to release potassium ions outside the cell.
Activity
Create a representation/diagram (or use the model you constructed of the plasma cell membrane) to explain
how the sodium-potassium pump contributes to the net negative change of the interior of an animal nerve
cell.
Think About It
If the pH outside the cell decreases, would you expect the amount of amino acids and glucose transported into the cell
to increase or decrease? Justify your reasoning.
Secondary Active Transport (Co-transport)
Secondary active transport brings sodium ions, and possibly other compounds, into the cell. As sodium ion concentrations
build outside of the plasma membrane because of the action of the primary active transport process, an electrochemical
gradient is created. If a channel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will be pulled through the membrane. This
movement is used to transport other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein thr
