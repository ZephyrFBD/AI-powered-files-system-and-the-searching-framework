he host—and the cells within
the host—that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks,
where each key will fit only one specific lock.
This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza) explains how influenza attacks the body.
The video shows how viruses replicate in our body. Using the terminology provided in the video, explain how a virus
attaches to a cell in our body?
a.
When the virus capsule makes contact with the cell, it bursts, and then the virions attach to the cell.
b.
If a key on the virus fits a lock on the surface of the cell, the virus will attach to the cell.
c.
The keys automatically attach to all the locks.
d.
The welcoming committee interlocks with the virus.
Entry
The nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses
can enter through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. Some enveloped vi
