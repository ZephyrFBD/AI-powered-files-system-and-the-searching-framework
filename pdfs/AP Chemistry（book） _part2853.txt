e, we often take for 
granted the many ways in which the atmosphere determines the environment in which 
we live. In this section we examine some of the important characteristics of our planet’s 
atmosphere.
The temperature of the atmosphere varies with altitude (Figure 18.1), and the atmo-
sphere is divided into four regions based on this temperature profile. Just above the sur-
face, in the troposphere, the temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude, 
reaching a minimum of about 215 K at about 10 km. Nearly all of us live our entire lives 
in the troposphere. Howling winds and soft breezes, rain, and sunny skies—all that we 
normally think of as “weather”—occur in this region. Commercial jet aircraft typically 
fly about 10 km (33,000 ft) above Earth, an altitude that defines the upper limit of the 
troposphere, which we call the tropopause.
Above the tropopause, air temperature increases with altitude, reaching a maximum 
of about 275 K at about 50 km. The region from 1
