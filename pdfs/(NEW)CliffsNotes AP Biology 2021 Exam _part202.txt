s to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA
and promotes transcription of genes that direct cellular activities. Gene expression varies depending on cell type and
gender. In males, for example, testosterone activates genes in the testes that direct the development of sperm cells,
but in muscle cells, it stimulates the production of muscle fibers. In females, estrogen activates genes that direct cells
in the uterus to prepare for pregnancy, but in mammary cells, estrogen inactivates those same genes.
Disease and Cancer
Although genes contain the information for what a cell will become and how that cell will function, external signals
strongly influence how those genes actually express that information. For various reasons, signals are sometimes
inaccurately acted upon because the signal transduction pathway is distorted and does not operate properly. Here are
two examples.
Cholera is a waterborne disease caused by bacteria. When contaminated water is ingested, the bacteria secrete a
toxin t
