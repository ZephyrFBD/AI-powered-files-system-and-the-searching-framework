d to be good thermal
conductors. Most metals fall in this category, although there is a wide range even
among them, as you may observe by holding the ends of a silver spoon and a
stainless-steel spoon immersed in the same hot cup of soup. Substances for which
k is small, such as wool, fiberglass, polyurethane, and goose down, are poor 
conductors of heat and are therefore good thermal insulators. The relative magni-
tudes of k can explain simple phenomena such as why a tile floor is much colder
on the feet than a rug-covered floor at the same temperature. Tile is a better 
conductor of heat than the rug. Heat that flows from your foot to the rug is not
conducted away rapidly, so the rug’s surface quickly warms up to the temperature
of your foot and feels good. But the tile conducts the heat away rapidly and thus
can take more heat from your foot quickly, so your foot’s surface temperature drops.
