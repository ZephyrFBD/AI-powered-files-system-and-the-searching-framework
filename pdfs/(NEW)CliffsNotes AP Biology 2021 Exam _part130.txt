rix to the intermembrane space. Some of these protein complexes are indicated in Figure 4-4 (PC I, PC
II, PC III, and PC IV). Another protein complex, ATP synthase, is responsible for the phosphorylation of ADP to
form ATP.
4. Matrix. The matrix is the fluid material that fills the area inside the inner membrane. The Krebs cycle and the
conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA occur here.
Chemiosmosis in Mitochondria
Chemiosmosis is the mechanism of ATP generation that occurs when energy is stored in the form of a proton
concentration gradient across a membrane. A description of the process during oxidative phosphorylation in
mitochondria follows (Figure 4-4):
1. The Krebs cycle produces NADH and FADH2 in the matrix. In addition, CO2 is generated and substrate-level
phosphorylation occurs to
 
produce ATP.
 
2. Electrons are removed from NADH and FADH2. Protein complexes
in the inner membrane remove electrons from these two molecules (2A, 2B). The electrons move along the electron
transpor
