endosymbionts.
EVO-2
There are several hypotheses about the natural origin of life on Earth, each with
supporting evidence.
Chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA.
The chloroplasts’ and the mitochondria’s DNA is more like
prokaryotic DNA than eukaryotic DNA. It is not wrapped with
histones.
These organelles have double membranes. The inner one belonged
to the symbiont; the outer one belongs to the host plasma
membrane. The theory states that the chloroplast and mitochondria
were taken up by the host cell by some sort of endosymbiosis
process, such as phagocytosis.
RNA WORLD
The RNA World concept hypothesizes that about 4 billion years ago, the
first genetic substance on Earth was not the large complex DNA molecule
but the small, single-stranded RNA molecule.
It has been
