Spermatogenesis, illustrated in Figure 34.14, occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules (Figure 34.10), with stem cells
at the periphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube. Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are
diploid, undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with
one offspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm.

Meiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte. At the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced
called a secondary spermatocyte. This cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division. The cell produced
at the end of meiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a
