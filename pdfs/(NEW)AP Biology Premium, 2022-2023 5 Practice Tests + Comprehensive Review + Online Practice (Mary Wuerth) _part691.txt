h of those chemical reactions trigger multiple chemical reactions. This
allows one ligand-binding event to trigger hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions in the cell.
(c) The cell would no longer be able to respond to acetylcholine.
(d) If an antibody irreversibly binds to the acetylcholine receptors, acetylcholine cannot bind to the receptors
and can no longer trigger the appropriate response in the cell.
5.
(a) The promoter serves as a binding site for RNA polymerase. The operator serves as a binding site for the
repressor protein.
(b) Since the tryptophan operon is a repressible operon, the presence of tryptophan would turn the operon off.
Tryptophan serves as a corepressor. It would bind to the repressor protein, and then the repressor protein
would bind to the operator, blocking RNA polymeraseâ€™s ability to transcribe the genes on the plasmid.
Green fluorescent protein would not be expressed.
(c)
(d) Negative feedback helps maintain homeostasis and near-constant levels of
