ll of the Bohr model of the atom. It is called the 1s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus.
The 1s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled.
Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within the 1s orbital occupied. This is designated as 1s1, where
the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s orbital. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely
fill the 1s orbital with its two electrons. This is designated as 1s2, referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1s orbital.
On the periodic table Figure 2.5, hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period); this is because
they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1s orbital. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1s
and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state.
The second electron shell may contain eight electrons. This shell contains
