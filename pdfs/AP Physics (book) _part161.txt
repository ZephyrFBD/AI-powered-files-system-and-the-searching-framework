A better approach is to use the following (rough) procedure, which we present as
a special “Problem Solving Strategy.” (Other such Problem Solving Strategies
will be found throughout the book.)

equation that involves only known quantities and
one desired unknown, solve the equation alge-
braically for the unknown.
Sometimes several
sequential calculations, or a combination of equa-
tions, may be needed. It is often preferable to solve
algebraically for the desired unknown before
putting in numerical values.
7. Carry out the calculation if it is a numerical problem.
Keep one or two extra digits during the calculations,
but round off the final answer(s) to the correct number
of significant figures (Section 1–4).
8. Think carefully about the result you obtain: Is it
reasonable? Does it make sense according to your
own intui
