y point on the plane can be specified by giving its x and y coor-
dinates. In three dimensions, a z axis perpendicular to the x and y axes is added.
For one-dimensional motion, we often choose the x axis as the line along
which the motion takes place. Then the position of an object at any moment is
given by its x coordinate. If the motion is vertical, as for a dropped object, we
usually use the y axis.
y = 0.

The displacement may not equal the
total distance traveled
We need to make a distinction between the distance an object has traveled
and its displacement, which is defined as the change in position of the 
object. That is, displacement is how far the object is from its starting point.
To see the distinction between total distance and displacement, imagine a person
walking 70 m to the east and then turning around and walki
