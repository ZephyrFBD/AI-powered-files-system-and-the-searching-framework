trons to the electron transport chain, the resulting
NAD+ and FADH can be recycled to be used as carriers again, and the hydrogen atoms are split into hydrogen ions
and electrons.
H2 → 2H+ + 2e–
The electron transport chain here is similar to that seen in photosynthesis.
They differ in their final electron acceptors: NADP+ and O2.
Then, two interesting things occur. First, the high-energy electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed down a
series of protein carrier molecules that are embedded in the cristae; thus, it is called the electron transport chain.
Some of the carrier molecules in the electron transport chain are NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome C.
Oxygen is required as the final stop in the electron transport chain.
Each carrier molecule hands down the electrons to the next molecule in the chain. The electrons travel down the
electron transport chain until they reach the final electron acceptor, oxygen. Oxygen combines with these electrons
(and some hydrogens) to form water. This
