sidue. This single change directly impacts the location where the substrate
to ARKKKK60491 attaches during catalysis. Which position is likely affected by this change?
(A) Position A
(B) Position B
(C) Position C
(D) None of the positions will be affected.
38. Which of the following is Position B most likely to assist the protein with?
(A) Stabilization of the substrate into the transition state during catalysis
(B) Transportation of catalyzed cargo from the nucleus to the mitochondria
(C) Creation of a homodimer through catalysis of homodimerization
(D) Attachment to the membrane by embedding into the phospholipid bilayer
39. Which of the following statements best predicts the effect on the proteinâ€™s structure if the subunits of the
homodimer fail to attach?
(A) The primary structure will change because the order of amino acids will differ.
(B) The secondary structure will differ because hydrogen bonds will occur in different locations and the protein
will fold into a different shape.
