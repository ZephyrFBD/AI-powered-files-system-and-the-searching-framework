t 40% could be found alive. What do
these data say about the survivorship curve that would best
describe this population? Explain your reasoning.
a.
Type II survivorship curve because the number
of survivors decreases by the same value (20%)
every year.
b.
Type I survivorship curve because the number of
survivors decreases by the same value (20%)
every year.
c.
Type II survivorship curve because the number
of survivors increases by the same value (20%)
every year.
d.
Type IV survivorship curve because the number
of survivors decreases by the same value (20%)
every year.
81. After discovering a new species of salamander in a
forest ecosystem, a researcher set traps at many different
locations within the forest and collects data from his traps.
The researcherâ€™s goal was to determine which types of
environments within the forest the salamander is most
likely to be found. Construct another scientific question
the researcher can answer using the data he has already
collected to further refi
