NOTE The voltage drop across the wires reduces the voltage that reaches the
speakers from the stereo amplifier, thus reducing the sound level a bit.

EXAMPLE 18;5
Stretching changes resistance. Suppose
a wire of resistance R could be stretched uniformly until it was twice its original
length. What would happen to its resistance? Assume the amount of material,
and therefore its volume, doesn’t change.
RESPONSE If the length doubles, then the cross-sectional area A is halved,
because the volume 
of the wire remains the same. From Eq. 18–3 we
see that the resistance would increase by a factor of four A21
