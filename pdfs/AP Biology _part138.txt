 cytoplasm.
In plant cells, a cell plate forms during telophase as vesicles from the
Golgi coalesce down the middle of the cell. Daughter plant cells do not
separate from each other. A new cell wall forms, and a sticky middle
lamella cements adjacent cells together. See Figure 4.5.

CELL DIVISION AND CANCEROUS CELLS
Normal cells grow and divide until they become too crowded; then they
stop dividing and enter G0 (G zero). This reaction to overcrowding is
called contact inhibition or density-dependent inhibition. Another
characteristic of normal animal cells is anchorage dependence. To divide,
a cell must be attached or anchored to some surface, such as a Petri dish
(in vitro) or an extracellular membrane (in vivo). Cancer cells show neither
contact inhibition nor anchorage dependence. They divide uncontrollably
and do not have to be anchored to any membrane. That is why cancer cells
can migrate or metastasize to other regions of the body.
