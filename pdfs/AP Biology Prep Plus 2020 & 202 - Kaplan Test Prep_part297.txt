the stomata would also result in increased transpiration and water
loss, making (B) correct. (C) and (D) are incorrect because increased
light intensity would cause photosynthesis to increase, not decrease.
(A) is incorrect because an increase in the rate of photosynthesis would
cause stomata to open, not close, thereby increasing the water loss.

The question stem specifically refers to nutrient acquisition from the
environment, which means that any answer choices discussing other
functions can be eliminated. Xylem is vascular plant tissue that
conducts most of the water and minerals upward from the roots to the
shoots. The structure described in (A) is actually phloem. Since it
incorrectly describes xylem and neither xylem nor phloem play a role
in nutrient acquisition, (A) can be eliminated. Similarly, (B) can be
eliminated because it discusses nutrients that have already been
acquired. Transpiration is the process by which moisture changes to
vapor an
