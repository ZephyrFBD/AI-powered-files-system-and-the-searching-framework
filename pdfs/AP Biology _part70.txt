the rapid evolution of multicelled organisms.
Modern cell theory states that all organisms are composed of cells and
that all cells arise from preexisting cells. Most animal and plant cells have
diameters between 10 and 100 µm (microns or micrometers), although
many, like human red blood cells with a diameter of only 8 µm, are
smaller.

All cells share certain characteristics. They are all enclosed by a
protective and selective barrier called a plasma membrane. They all
contain a semifluid substance called cytosol in which subcellular
components are suspended. Finally, all cells contain ribosomes and genetic
material in the form of DNA.
There are two types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes
are simple cells that contain no nuclei or other internal membranes. All
bacteria are prokaryotic cells. Instead of a nucleus, they have a nucleoid
region, which is a non-membrane-bound region where the chromosome is
located. Eukaryotic cel
