 N 2s atomic orbital. As a result, the s
2s MO has a slightly 
greater contribution from O than from Nâ€”the orbital is no longer an equal mixture of 
the two atoms, as was the case for the homonuclear diatomic molecules. Similarly, the 
s*
2s antibonding MO is weighted more heavily toward the N atom because that MO is 
closest in energy to the N 2s atomic orbital.
We complete the MO diagram for NO by filling the MOs in Figure 9.46 with the 11 
valence electrons. Eight bonding and three antibonding electrons give a bond order of 
1
218 - 32 = 21
2, which agrees better with experiment than the Lewis structures do. The 
unpaired electron resides in one of the p*
2p MOs, which have a greater contribution 
 
from the N atom. (We could have placed this electron in either the left or right p*
2p MO.) 
Thus, the Lewis structure that places the unpaired electron on nitrogen (the one pre-
ferred on the basis of formal charge) is the more accurate description of the true electron 
distribution in
