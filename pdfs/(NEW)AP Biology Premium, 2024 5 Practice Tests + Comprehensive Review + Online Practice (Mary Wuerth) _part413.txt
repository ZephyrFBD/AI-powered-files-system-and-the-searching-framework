is usually made of agarose and contains microscopic pores through which the DNA fragments
migrate. Shorter fragments will be able to travel more quickly through these pores; longer fragments will take more
time. This leads to shorter fragments being found at the bottom of the gel, farthest from the well into which the DNA
sample was loaded; longer fragments will be closer to the top of the gel. The addition of a DNA marker with
fragments of known lengths runs alongside the other DNA samples, providing a “ruler” by which to estimate the
size of each fragment produced. Each organism’s pattern of fragments on the gel will be different and can be used to
create a unique DNA fingerprint.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify specific DNA fragments. PCR can be used to create millions
of copies of a specific fragment of DNA. PCR involves cycles of DNA replication using primers that are specific to
the beginning and end of the fragment of the DNA se
