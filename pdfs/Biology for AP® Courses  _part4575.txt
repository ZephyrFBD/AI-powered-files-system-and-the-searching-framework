 are an invasive species that
has spread in the forest of the Pacific Northwest. The
plants develop thick tangles of cane covered with thorns
that cover ground with a tight mat. Ecologists
hypothesized that Himalayan blackberries displace native
species of shrubs by reproducing faster and reducing areas
available for growth. They recorded the density of
blackberries and native salmonberries, a native shrub,
along a creek for several years. The percentage areas of
ground covered by blackberries and native shrubs were
plotted over time. Based on the graph, what statement best
explain the role of blackberries on the ecosystem studied?
a.
Blackberries promote the growth of salmonberry
shrubs.
b.
Blackberries and salmonberry shrubs do not
interfere with each otherâ€™s growth.
c.
Salmonberry shrubs prevent the growth of
blackberries.
d.
Blackberries displaced salmonberry shrubs.
