the inward magnetic field will exert a downward force on the electrons of mag-
nitude
where 
is the drift velocity of the electrons (Section 18–8).
Thus the electrons will tend to move nearer to side D than side C, causing a
potential difference between sides C and D of the conductor. This potential
difference builds up until the electric field 
that it produces exerts a force
on the moving charges that is equal and opposite to the magnetic force
. This is the Hall effect, named after E. H. Hall who discovered it in 1879.
The difference of potential produced is called the Hall emf. Its magnitude is
where d is the width of the conductor.
A current of negative charges moving to the right is equivalent to positive
charges moving to the left, at least for most purposes. But the Hall effect can
distinguish these two. As can be seen in Fig. 20–21b, positive particles moving to
the left are deflected downward, so that the bottom surface is positive relative to
the top surface. This is t
