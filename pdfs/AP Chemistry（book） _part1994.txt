ture. The three different structures are those shown 
in Figure 12.26. (a) Use ionic radii, Cs+ 1r = 1.81 A
° 2, 
Na+ 1r = 1.16 A
° 2, Cu+ 1r = 0.74 A
° 2, and, I- 1r = 2.06 A
° 2, to 
predict which compound will crystallize with which struc-
ture. (b) What is the coordination number of iodide in each 
of these structures?
 12.64  The rutile and fluorite structures, shown here (anions are 
colored green), are two of the most common structure types 
of ionic compounds where the cation to anion ratio is 1 
: 2. 
(a) For CaF2 and ZnF2 use ionic radii, Ca2+ 1r = 1.14 A
° 2,
Zn2+ 1r = 0.88 A
° 2, and F- 1r = 1.19 A
° 2, to predict which 
compound is more likely to crystallize with the fluorite 
structure and which with the rutile structure. (b) What are 
the coordination numbers of the cations and anions in each 
of these structures?
(b) For molecular solids, the melting point generally in-
creases as the strengths of the intermolecular forces 
increase.
