re your parents or grandparents ever

(C) Were you in physical contact with a person
diagnosed with Huntington’s disease? 
2. Over several years, bacteria were isolated from
members of a human population and tested for
antibiotic resistance. The percent of bacterial
isolates that were found to be antibiotic resistant
is presented in the graph above for each year of
the study. Which of the following conclusions is
best supported by the information presented in the
graph?
(D) Were you ever exposed to substances that are
suspected of being mutagens? 
(A) The greatest increase in antibiotic resistance
occurred from the first year to the third year 
of the study. 
(B) Gene flow in the population occurred at the 
same rate for the entire duration of the 
eight-year study. 
(C) Because evolution in bacterial populations 
occurs over millions of years, the results are 
due to random variation. 
(D) Natural selection over multiple generations  
is favorin
