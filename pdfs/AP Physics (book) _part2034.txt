61. A person accidentally leaves a car with the lights on. If each
of the two headlights uses 40 W and each of the two taillights
6 W, for a total of 92 W, how long will a fresh 12-V battery
last if it is rated at 
Assume the full 12 V appears
across each bulb.
62. A sequence of potential differences V is applied across 
a wire 
and the
resulting currents I are measured as follows:

(a) If this wire obeys Ohm’s law, graphing I vs. V will result
in a straight-line plot. Explain why this is so and determine
the theoretical predictions for the straight line’s slope and
y-intercept. (b) Plot I vs. V. Based on this plot, can you
conclude that the wire obeys Ohm’s law (i.e., did you
obtain a straight line with the expected y-intercept, within
