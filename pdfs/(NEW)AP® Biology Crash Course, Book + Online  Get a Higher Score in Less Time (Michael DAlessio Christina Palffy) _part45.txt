sferred from PSII → primary electron acceptor → until donated to PSI → next
electron carriers → donated to NADP+ to reduce it to NADPH.
ii. Electrons can take either a noncyclical route or a cyclical one. The primary difference between the
two is that the cyclical flow of electrons produces more ATP and takes place because the Calvin
Cycle uses more ATP per mole than NADPH per mole, and hence replenishes the used ATP.
iii. The proton gradient is linked to the synthesis of ATP and ADP and inorganic phosphate via ATP
synthase.
4. Chemiosmosis—the movement of H+ ions down their concentration gradient from inside the
thylakoids to the stroma. As they do this, they pass through the enzyme, ATP synthase, which causes
the catalysis of ATP from ADP and Pi.

The following figure shows both the electron transport and chemiosmosis of photosynthesis.
5. Flow summary—absorption and conversion of light energy to ATP and NADPH.
i.
Pigments absorb light energy.
ii. Light energy sends electrons down
