Be able to describe the connection between the regulation of gene expression and
observable differences within cells and between individuals in a population.
Regulation at the Chromatin Structure Level
Eukaryotic DNA is packaged with proteins called histones into an
elaborate complex known as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the
nucleosome. Changes to the histone structure alter chromatin
configuration, binding it more tightly or more loosely, thus making DNA
less or more accessible for transcription and expression. The inhibition is
reversible.
Acetylation of histone tails, adding of acetyl groups (–COCH3),
promotes the loosening of that chromatin structure and permits
transcription. Removing acetyl groups blocks transcription.
