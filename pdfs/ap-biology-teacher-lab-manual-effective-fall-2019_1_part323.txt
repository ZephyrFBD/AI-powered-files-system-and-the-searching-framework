ecause you will be working 
with acids and caustic chemicals. The HCl and NaOH solutions will cause chemical 
burns, and you should use these solutions in spill-proof trays or pans. Follow your 
teacher’s instructions carefully. Do not work in the laboratory without your teacher’s 
supervision. Talk to your teacher if you have any questions or concerns about the 
experiments.  
■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
This investigation consists of three parts. In Procedure 1, you use artificial cells to study 
the relationship of surface area and volume. In Procedure 2, you create models of living 
cells to explore osmosis and diffusion. You finish by observing osmosis in living cells 
(Procedure 3). All three sections of the investigation provide opportunities for you to 
design and conduct your own experiments. 
■ Getting Started 
These questions are designed to help you understand kinetic energy, osmosis, and 
diffusion and to prepare for your investigations. 
•  What is kinetic energy, and how does
