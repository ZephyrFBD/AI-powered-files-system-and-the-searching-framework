s that consume pathogens and cancer cells, natural killer (NK) cells that destroy tumor cells
and virus-infected cells, several types of white blood cells, and even protective proteins like complement and interferon. We
know from experience, however, that these barriers can fail. Fortunately, adaptive immune responses provide another, more
specific line of defense.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
