ient was a complete secondary embryo attached at
the site of the graft. The dorsal lip induced the abdomen tissue above it to
become neural tissue. Because it plays a crucial role in development,
Spemann named the dorsal lip the primary embryonic organizer or
simply the organizer. After many years of study, scientists have identified
that the protein Î²-catenin is a likely candidate for the transcription factor
that triggers which cells become the organizers.
REMEMBER
Embryonic induction in development results in the correct timing of events.
Apoptosis
Apoptosis is programmed cell death. (See also page 53.) We have seen
that it is an integral part of the immune system. It is also crucial to the
normal development of embryos. For instance, many more neurons are
produced during development of the vertebrate nervous system compared
to the number of neurons that exist in the adult. That is because neurons
survive if they make connections with other neurons during development
and self-destru
