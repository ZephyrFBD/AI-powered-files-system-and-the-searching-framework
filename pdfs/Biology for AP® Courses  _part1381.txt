 the observed traits in the F2 offspring
will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.
Alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns. Incomplete dominance describes situations in which the
heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes. Codominance describes the
simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote. Although diploid organisms can only have two alleles

for any given gene, it is common for more than two alleles of a gene to exist in a population. In humans, as in many
animals and some plants, females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Genes that are
present on the X but not the Y chromosome are said to be X-linked, such that males only inherit one allele for the gene,
and females inherit two. Finally, some alleles can be lethal.
