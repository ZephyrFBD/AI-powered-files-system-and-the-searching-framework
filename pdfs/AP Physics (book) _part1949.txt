inst even low resistance in any
normal conductor. We can control the flow of charge using electric fields and
electric potential (voltage), concepts we have just been discussing. In order to
have a current in a wire, a potential difference is needed, which can be provided
by a battery.
We first look at electric current from a macroscopic point of view. Later in
the Chapter we look at currents from a microscopic (theoretical) point of view as
a flow of electrons in a wire.
18–1 The Electric Battery
Until the year 1800, the technical development of electricity consisted mainly of
producing a static charge by friction. It all changed in 1800 when Alessandro
Volta (1745–1827; Fig. 18–1) invented the electric battery, and with it produced
the first steady flow of electric charge—that is, a steady electric current.
The events that led to the discovery of the battery are interesting. Not only
was this an important discovery, but it also gave rise to a famous scientific 
debate.
In the 1780s,
