ming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. A probability
of one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not
to occur. An example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant. In his experiment, Mendel demonstrated
that the probability of the event “round seed” occurring was one in the F1 offspring of true-breeding parents, one of which
has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds. When the F1 plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of
any given F2 offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. In other words, in a large population of F2 offspring
chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds.
Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other
crosses.
