frameshift mutation) to synthesize a polyprotein.
In this example, the insertion of an additional cytosine nucleotide resulted in a frameshift and a premature stop
codon.
2. Duplications can result in an extra copy of genes and are usually caused by unequal crossing-over during
meiosis or chromosome rearrangements. This may result in new traits because one copy of the gene can
maintain the original function and the other copy may evolve a new function.
3. Inversions can result when changes occur in the orientation of chromosomal regions. This may cause harmful
effects if the inversion involves a gene or an important regulatory sequence.
4. Translocations occur when two different chromosomes (or a single chromosome in two different places) break
and rejoin in a way that causes the DNA sequence or gene to be lost, repeated, or interrupted.
5. Transposons are gene segments that can cut/paste themselves throughout the genome. The presence of a
transposon can interrupt a gene and cause erro
