STOGRAMS
If you carried out an experiment and collected any type of data, a good
first step is to organize the data on a histogram. To do this, take the entire
range of values and divide it into a series of intervals. For example, letâ€™s
pretend you measured the height of 100 trees in a forest. Your intervals
could be 5' to 9', 10' to 14', 15' to 19', and 20' to 24'. Make sure that the
intervals: (1) do not overlap, (2) are adjacent, and (3) are all the same size.
Examine the following intervals. Determine if they are acceptable or
not and why.
1' to 4', 6' to 10', 13' to 20'
They are not acceptable intervals because they are not adjacent and
there are unequal gaps between them. In addition, the intervals themselves
are not of equal size.
Once you have decided on your intervals, place them on the x-axis.
Next, count how many values fall into each interval and plot them on a
graph, such as the histogram shown here:
