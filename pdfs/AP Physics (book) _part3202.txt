a parallel beam, each having kinetic
energy 0.025 eV, are directed through two slits 0.40 mm
apart. How far apart will the interference peaks be on a
screen 1.0 m away? [Hint: First find the wavelength of the
neutron.]
2. (II) Pellets of mass 2.0 g are fired in parallel paths with
speeds of 
through a hole 3.0 mm in diameter.
How far from the hole must you be to detect a 1.0-cm-
diameter spread in the beam of pellets?

of
With what maximum precision
can its position be ascertained? [Hint:
]
4. (I) If an electron’s position can be measured to a precision
of 
how precisely can its speed be known?
5. (I) An electron remains in an excited state of an atom for
typically 
What is the minimum uncertainty in the
energy of the state (in eV)?
6. (II) The 
boson, discovered in 1985, is the mediator of
the weak nuclear force, and it typically decays very quickly.
Its average rest energy is 91.19 GeV, but its short lifetime
