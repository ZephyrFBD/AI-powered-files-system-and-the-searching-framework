Yeast can also be used to study sexual reproduction, a
somewhat puzzling phenomenon. Cloning of cells through
mitosis is molecularly much less complex than meiosis,
consumes less energy, and is less risky. Two alternative
explanations for the evolution of sexual reproduction are
popular. In one model, through assortment of genes,
meiosis leads to an increase in the frequency of beneficial
mutations. In the second model, detrimental mutations are
purged from a population through sex. Studies using yeast
(Gray and Goddard, Evol. Biol., 2012 and McDonald et
al., Nature 2012) have provided a mechanism to study
these models. As shown below, the fitness (defined as the
log of the ratio of the number of cells in successive
generations) of yeast is graphed as a function of number of
mitotic reproducti
