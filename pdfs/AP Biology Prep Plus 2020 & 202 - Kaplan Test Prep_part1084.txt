9. During times of high rainfall, haygrazer grows much faster than
bermudagrass and the haygrazer soil is dry while the bermudagrass soil
remains moist. In dry conditions, both types of grass have similar growth
patterns and no diﬀerence in soil water content. Which of the following
explains these diﬀerences?
Bermudagrass is better than haygrazer at absorbing large amounts
of water during heavy rainfall.
(A)
Haygrazer is not good at absorbing large amounts of water during
heavy rainfall.
(B)
In the presence of large amounts of water, bermudagrass activates
more water uptake.
(C)
In the presence of large amounts of water, haygrazer activates more
water and nutrient uptake mechanisms.
(D)
10. Researchers discovered that haygrazers produce energy through
photosynthesis faster during the summer season. Which of the following
best describes the observed tropism in haygrazers?
Haygrazers are short-day plants that grow when exposed to less
than 12 hou
