gin of new species (a population of individuals who can mate with each other and
produce viable offspring). In other words, when a population emerges that can no longer mate and
produce fertile offspring with the original population, then a new species is said to have developed.
1. How Does It Occur?
i.
Allopatric Speciation—populations are separated by geographical isolation; thus, a new species
can be formed following adaption to new surroundings.
ii. Adaptive Radiation—Evolution of many species from a common ancestor. The finches Darwin
found on the Galapagos Islands are an example of adaptive radiation.
iii. Sympatric Speciation—populations are not separated by geographical isolation, but a new species
is formed within the parent populations.
Autopolyploidy—meiotic error causes a species to have more than two sets of chromosomes.
Contribution is from one species.
Allopolyploidy—polyploidy is a result of two different species.
2. How Fast Does It Occur?
i.
Gradualism—species are pro
