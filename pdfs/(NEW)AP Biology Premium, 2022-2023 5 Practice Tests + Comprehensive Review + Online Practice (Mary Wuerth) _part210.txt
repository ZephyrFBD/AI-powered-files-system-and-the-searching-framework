rier NAD+.
During glycolysis, the glucose molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen atoms and their electrons), and each NAD+ is
reduced (gains a hydrogen atom and its electrons) to NADH. Remember that whenever one molecule is oxidized,
another molecule must be reduced. During cellular respiration, the molecules that contain carbon are oxidized and
the electron carriers NAD+ and FAD+ are reduced.
TIP
Remember to follow the carbons: While you do not need to know the structures of glucose and pyruvate, know how many carbons are in each
molecule.
Two molecules of ATP are required in the early steps of glycolysis. However, four molecules of ATP are
produced by glycolysis, resulting in a net gain of two ATP molecules.
At the end of glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is cleaved into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.
Glycolysis is a multistep process that involves many enzyme-catalyzed steps and intermediates. When studying
for the AP Biology exam, focus on where each process in cellul
