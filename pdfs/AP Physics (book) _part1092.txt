 it
from penetrating easily between the fibers of material and into tiny crevices.
Substances that reduce the surface tension of a liquid are called surfactants.
Capillarity
Surface tension plays a role in another interesting phenomenon, capillarity. It is a
common observation that water in a glass container rises up slightly where it
touches the glass, Fig. 10–37a. The water is said to “wet” the glass. Mercury, on
the other hand, is depressed when it touches the glass, Fig. 10–37b; the mercury
does not wet the glass. Whether a liquid wets a solid surface is determined by the
relative strength of the cohesive forces between the molecules of the liquid 
compared to the adhesive forces between the molecules of the liquid and those 
of the container. Cohesion refers to the force between molecules of the same type,
whereas adhesion refers to the force between molecules of different types. Water
wets glass because the water molecules are more strongly attracted to the glass
molecules than t
