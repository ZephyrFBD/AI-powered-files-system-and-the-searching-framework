ther an ionic compound 
will be soluble in water. (The solubility of a substance is the amount 
that dissolves in a given quantity of solvent.) Reactions such as pre-
cipitation reactions, in which cations and anions appear to exchange 
partners, are called exchange reactions, or metathesis reactions.
Chemical equations can be written to show whether dissolved 
substances are present in solution predominantly as ions or molecules. 
When the complete chemical formulas of all reactants and products 
are used, the equation is called a molecular equation. A complete ionic 
equation shows all dissolved strong electrolytes as their component 
ions. In a net ionic equation, those ions that go through the reaction 
unchanged (spectator ions) are omitted.
ACIDS, BASES, AND NEUTRALIZATION REACTIONS (SECTION 4.3)  
Acids and bases are important electrolytes. Acids are proton donors; they 
increase the concentration of H+1aq2 in aqueous solutions to which 
they are added. Bases are proton acceptor
