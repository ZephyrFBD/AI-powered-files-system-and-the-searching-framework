 negative
pressure (tension) to develop in the xylem tissue from the roots to the
leaves. The cohesion of water due to strong attraction between water
molecules makes it possible to pull a column of water from above within
the xylem. The absorption of sunlight drives transpiration by causing water
to evaporate from the leaf. Transpirational pullâ€“cohesion tension theory
states that for each molecule of water that evaporates from a leaf by
transpiration, another molecule of water is drawn in at the root to replace
it.
Several factors affect the rate of transpiration:
High humidity slows down transpiration, while low humidity
speeds it up.
Wind can reduce humidity near the stomates and thereby increase
transpiration.
Increased light intensity will increase photosynthesis and thereby
increase the amount of water vapor to be transpired and increase the
rate of transpiration.
Closing stomates stops transpiration.
