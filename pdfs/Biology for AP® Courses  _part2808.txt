through water and allows the animal to swim at
high speeds. Table 24.1 lists the maximum speed of various animals. Certain types of sharks can swim at fifty kilometers
an hour and some dolphins at 32 to 40 kilometers per hour. Land animals frequently travel faster, although the tortoise and
snail are significantly slower than cheetahs. Another difference in the adaptations of aquatic and land-dwelling organisms
is that aquatic organisms are constrained in shape by the forces of drag in the water since water has higher viscosity than
air. On the other hand, land-dwelling organisms are constrained mainly by gravity, and drag is relatively unimportant. For
example, most adaptations in birds are for gravity not for drag.
