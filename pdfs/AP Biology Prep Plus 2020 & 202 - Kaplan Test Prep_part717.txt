tion on coloration patterns.
(B)
There is an increase in the amount of contrast with each
generation, as evidenced by the increasing height of the bars
on the right side of the graph.
(C)
There is coevolution between the two species because only
closely-matching parasitic eggs are likely to be raised by the
host parent.

10. The figure below shows the underlying bone structure of three
diﬀerent animals.
Which of the following conclusions can be reasonably drawn from
this figure?
All of these animals had a common ancestor that had the same
underlying bone pattern.
(A)
The similarities of the bone structures are the result of
convergent evolution in which similar environmental forces
caused diﬀerent organisms to evolve similarly.
(B)
The underlying bone structures are so diﬀerent that we can
conclude that each line evolved independently from diﬀerent
single-celled ancestors.
(C)
The similarities in the bone structures suggest that all of these
animals evolved from the whale.
