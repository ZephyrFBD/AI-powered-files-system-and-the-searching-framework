f
water. In the latter case, it is heavy water, in which the hydrogen atoms have
been replaced by deuterium. Another common moderator is graphite, which
consists of 
atoms.
A second problem is that the neutrons produced in one fission may be
absorbed and produce other nuclear reactions with other nuclei in the reactor,
rather than produce further fissions. In a “light-water” reactor, the 
nuclei
absorb neutrons, as does 
to form 
in the reaction
Naturally occurring uranium† contains 99.3%
and only 0.7% fissionable
To increase the probability of fission of 
nuclei, natural uranium can be
enriched to increase the percentage of 
by using processes such as diffusion
or centrifugation. Enrichment is not usually necessary for reactors using heavy
water as moderator because heavy water doesn’t absorb neutrons.
The third problem is that some neutrons will escape through the surface of
the reactor core before they can cause further fissions (Fig. 31–7). Thus the mass
of fuel must be sufficientl
