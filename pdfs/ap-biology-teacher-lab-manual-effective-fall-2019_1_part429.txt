biotechnology investigations. Because DNA testing makes it possible to profile ourselves 
genetically, the investigation raises questions about who owns our DNA and the 
information it carries.

CELL DIVISION:  
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
How do eukaryotic cells divide to produce genetically identical 
cells or to produce gametes with half the normal DNA?
 
â– BACKGROUND
One of the characteristics of living things is the ability to replicate and pass on genetic 
information to the next generation. Cell division in individual bacteria and archaea 
usually occurs by binary fission. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also replicate by binary 
fission, which is evidence of the evolutionary relationship between these organelles and 
prokaryotes. 
Cell division in eukaryotes is more complex. It requires the cell to manage a 
complicated process of duplicating the nucleus, other organelles, and multiple 
chromosomes. This process, called the cell cycle, is divi
