C
Based on the microscopy data, the organism has a cell wall and lacks mitochondria. The presence of a cell
wall suggests that the organism is not a protozoan, so eliminate (B). The absence of mitochondria is
indicative of prokaryotic structure because they lack organelles, eliminating (A) and (D). The most likely
conclusion is that this organism is a bacterial species.

B
Although many of the mentioned organelles work closely together, the only choice that can be correct is
(B). Ribosomes translate and manufacture proteins, often on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Those
proteins are then packaged in the Golgi bodies into vesicles, which are then fused with the plasma
membrane. Choice (A) is incorrect because the nuclear envelope and nucleolus do not interact with
vacuoles; they interact with the centrioles only during mitosis. Choice (C) is incorrect because ribosomes
donâ€™t often interact with mitochondria, and lysosomes interact only wi
