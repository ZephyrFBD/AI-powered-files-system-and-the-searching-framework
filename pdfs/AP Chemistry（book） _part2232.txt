reases, leading to an 
increase in reaction rate. According to the kinetic-molecular theory of 
gases, increasing the temperature increases molecular speeds. As mole-
cules move faster, they collide more forcefully (with more energy) and 
more frequently, both of which increase the reaction rate.
For a reaction to occur, though, more is required than simply a 
collision—it must be the right kind of collision. For most reactions, in 
fact, only a tiny fraction of collisions leads to a reaction. For example, 
in a mixture of H2 and I2 at ordinary temperatures and pressures, each 
molecule undergoes about 1010 collisions per second. If every collision

occurs more rapidly in hot water, and more 
light is produced.
