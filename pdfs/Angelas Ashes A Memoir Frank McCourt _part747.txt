 behind her house and I’m to come in the back door for fear someone 
 
 might see me. 
 
 In a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers

 of ’em. 
 
 My first letter, 
 
 Dear Mrs. O’Brien, 
 
 Inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you 
 
 owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action.There’s your 
 
 son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit 
 
 which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep 
 
 body and soul together. I am sure you don’t want to languish 
 
  
  
 in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family. 
 
 I remain, yours in litigious anticipation, 
 
 Mrs. Brigid Finucane
