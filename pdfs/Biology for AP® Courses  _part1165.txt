cause the mutation will not be carried forward. If a
cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation
causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated

without being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are
met. If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated
and no harm would come to the organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions,
subsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that
regulate the cell cycle.
The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the
cell cycle regulatory proteins, any pr
