ids are then brought to the ribosome and joined
together by peptide bonds in the elongation stage.
Termination
The termination stage is always triggered by one of three stop codons:
UAA, UGA, or UAG. They stop protein synthesis and release the protein
from the ribosome.
AP EXPERT NOTE
To remember the start codon (AUG), think of the month that is the
start of the school year for many students: AUGust. A mnemonic
to help remember the three stop codons (UAA, UGA, UAG) is: U Are
Annoying, U Go Away, U Are Gone.
POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS
Aȇer translation, synthesized polypeptides or proteins may undergo post-
translational modifications, which generally include covalent enzymatic
alterations to amino acids or the C-terminus or N-terminus. Post-
translational modifications influence a protein’s structure and specify a
protein’s function. Examples of post-translational modifications are
phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation. Phosphorylation is
involved in various cellular
