prevail in the media, blood plasma and lymph or in the
ocean and river water of today.”
D. In your own words, summarize the argument that
Macallum is using to justify this claim.
32. Approximately half the energy that flows through the
Earth’s biosphere is captured by phytoplankton,
photosynthetic microscopic organisms in the surface
waters of the oceans. Scientists think the growth of
phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean is limited by the
availability of nitrogen, whereas growth in the Pacific
Ocean is limited by the availability of iron.
The concentration of oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere of
early Earth was low and, therefore, so was the
concentration of dissolved oxygen in the early ocean.
Because insoluble iron oxides (rust) do not form in the
absence of oxygen, soluble iron io
