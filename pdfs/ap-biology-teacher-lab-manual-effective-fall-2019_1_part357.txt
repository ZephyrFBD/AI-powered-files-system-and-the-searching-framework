e that might affect the rate of photosynthesis. Possible questions 
generated from students’ observations include the following. However, it is suggested 
that students generate their own questions to explore. 
•  What environmental variables might affect the net rate of photosynthesis? Why do 
you think they would affect it? How do you predict they would affect it? 
•  What features or variables of the plant leaves might affect the net rate of  
photosynthesis? How and why?

•  Could the way you perform the procedure affect the outcome? If the outcome 
changes, does it mean the net rate of photosynthesis has changed? Why do you think 
that? 
If students are truly stumped, you can give them some guidance. Tell students that leaves 
with hairy surfaces should be avoided and that ivy and spinach are among the plants 
that work well. Differences between plants may be one of the ideas that students want to
