ons of the same species
parallel structures in diverse organisms that have a common ancestor
offspring of two closely related individuals, not of the same species
area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids
reproduction of individuals with favorable genetic traits that survive environmental change because of
those traits, leading to evolutionary change
gametes with extra chromosomes
reproductive isolation mechanism that occurs after zygote formation
reproductive isolation mechanism that occurs before zygote formation
model for rapid speciation that can occur when an event causes a small portion of a population
to be cut off from the rest of the population
continued speciation divergence between two related species due to low fitness of hybrids between them
situation that occurs when a species is reproductively independent from other species; this may
be brought about by behavior, location, or reproductive barriers
formation of a new specie
