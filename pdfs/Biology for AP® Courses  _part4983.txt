cifer’ is a central ﬁgure in Sabbatian-Frankism
and its associated Satanism. Sabbatians reject the Jewish Torah, or
Pentateuch, the ‘ﬁve books of Moses’ in the Old Testament known as
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy which are
claimed by Judaism and Christianity to have been dictated by ‘God’
to Moses on Mount Sinai. Sabbatians say these do not apply to them
and they seek to replace them with the Zohar to absorb Judaism and
its followers into their inversion which is an expression of a much
greater global inversion. They want to delete all religions and force
humanity to worship a one-world religion – Sabbatian Satanism that
also includes worship of the Earth goddess. Satanic themes are being
more and more introduced into mainstream society and while
Christianity is currently the foremost target for destruction the
others are planned to follow.
