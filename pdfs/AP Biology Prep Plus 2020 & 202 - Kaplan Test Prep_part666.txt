shared by siblings suggests the disease
is caused by a genetic component. When genes are located close
together on the same chromosome, they are likely to stay together
during meiosis and be inherited together. As a result, these traits will
typically be shared by siblings. Hence, the correct answer is (A). (B) is
incorrect because correlation does not necessarily reflect causation
and there is insuﬀicient information to draw this conclusion from the
passage. (C) is incorrect because there is no evidence presented that
the disease is entirely caused by environmental conditions and
because the evidence that is given suggests a genetic component. (D)
is incorrect because, when genes are located far apart on a
chromosome, they are oȇen separated by crossing over during
prophase I of meiosis. This would likely prevent them from being
inherited in exactly the same way in siblings.
