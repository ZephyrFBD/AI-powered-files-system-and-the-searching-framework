 graph below shows the different dissociation curves that maternal (normal) hemoglobin
and fetal hemoglobin have.
8. Based on the graph, it can be concluded that
(A) fetal hemoglobin surrenders O2 more readily than maternal hemoglobin
(B) the dissociation curve of fetal hemoglobin is to the right of maternal hemoglobin
(C) fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for O2 than does maternal hemoglobin
(D) fetal and maternal hemoglobin differ in structure
9. Which of the following processes would likely shift the normal dissociation curve to the right?
(A) Photosynthesis
(B) Respiration
(C) Fermentation
(D) Mitosis
10. Hemoglobin’s affinity for O2
(A) decreases as blood pH decreases
(B) increases as H+ concentration increases
(C) increases as blood pH decreases
(D) decreases as OH– concentration increases
11. How much pO2 would it take in an extremely CO2-rich environment to saturate hemoglobin 90 percent?
(A) 15
(B) 30
(C) 45
(D) 60
