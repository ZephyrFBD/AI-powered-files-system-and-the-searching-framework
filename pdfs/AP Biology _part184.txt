the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. In its role in cellular
respiration, SDH combines with succinate to produce fumarate.
Succinate + SDH â†’ Fumarate
A researcher wanted to explore the role of malonate, another
molecule involved in cellular respiration. She added it to the reaction
tube that contained SDH and succinate. The result was an accumulation
of succinate and a decrease in the production of fumarate.
Given the results of this experiment, which of the following
statements describes the most likely role of malonate in cellular
respiration?
Malonate is a competitive inhibitor of SDH because it replaced
succinate in the reaction and caused a decrease in the formation
of fumarate.
Malonate is a coenzyme for SDH because when it was present,
SDH was more efficient and there was an increase in the
production of fumarate.
