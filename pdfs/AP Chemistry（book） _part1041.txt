ed to the paradox 
discussed in the Closer Look box on “Thought Experiments 
and Schrödinger’s Cat”?
 [6.98]  Consider the discussion of radial probability functions in 
“A Closer Look” in Section 6.6. (a) What is the difference 
between the probability density as a function of r and the 
radial probability function as a function of r ? (b) What is the 
signiﬁcance of the term 4pr2 in the radial probability func-
tions for the s orbitals? (c) Based on Figures 6.19 and 6.22, 
make sketches of what you think the probability density as a 
function of r and the radial probability function would look 
like for the 4s orbital of the hydrogen atom.
 [6.99]  For orbitals that are symmetric but not spherical, the contour 
representations (as in Figures 6.23 and 6.24) suggest where 
nodal planes exist (that is, where the electron density is 
zero). For  
example, the px orbital has a node wherever x = 0. 
This equation is satisﬁed by all points on the yz plane, so this 
plane is called a nodal p
