needed and is ready to proceed to the next step in 
its cycle. Cells pass the G1 checkpoint when they are stimulated by appropriate external 
growth factors; for example, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates cells 
near a wound to divide so that they can repair the injury. The G2 checkpoint checks 
for damage after DNA is replicated, and if there is damage, it prevents the cell from 
going into mitosis. The M-spindle (metaphase) checkpoint assures that the mitotic 
spindles or microtubules are properly attached to the kinetochores (anchor sites on the 
chromosomes). If the spindles are not anchored properly, the cell does not continue on 
through mitosis. The cell cycle is regulated very precisely. Mutations in cell cycle genes 
that interfere with proper cell cycle control are found very often in cancer cells.
