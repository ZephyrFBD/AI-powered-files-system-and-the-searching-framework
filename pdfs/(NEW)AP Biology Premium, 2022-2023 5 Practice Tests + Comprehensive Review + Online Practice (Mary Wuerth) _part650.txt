(c) Justify your placement of the organisms on the cladogram in your response to part (b).
(d) A claim is made that chickens share a more recent common ancestor with humans than turtles do. Identify
at least one piece of experimental evidence that might be used to support this claim.
2. A botanist measures the stomatal density on both the upper surface (facing the sun) and lower surface (shaded
from the sun) of the leaves from two plant species. Purple passionflower, Passiflora incarnata, is native to
Florida and Texas and is found in habitats with a humid climate. White oak, Quercus alba, is native to the
central and northern United States and prefers a drier climate with seasons. The mean stomatal density and the
standard errors of the mean are shown in the following table.
Plant Species
Mean Stomatal Density of Upper Surface (Number of
Stomata per mm2) ± SEM*
Mean Stomatal Density of Lower Surface (Number of
Stomata per mm2) ± SEM
Passiflora incarnata
