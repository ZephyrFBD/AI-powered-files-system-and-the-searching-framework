of factors including:
■Population size (N)
■Birth rate (B)
■Death rate (D)

You do not need to memorize the equations presented in this chapter. These equations are included on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas
sheet that you will have access to during the AP Biology exam. Spend your time applying your knowledge by answering as many practice
problems as possible using these formulas.
Population growth rates are calculated as the change in the population size over change in time: 
. One way to
calculate the rate of population growth is to simply compare the birth rate and the death rate in the population, as in
the following equation:
If the birth rate exceeds the death rate in a population, the population size will increase. If the birth rate is less
than the death rate in a population, the population size will decrease.
If there are no limiting factors on the growth of a population (there is abundant food and habitat, no predators are
present, etc.), a population will experienc
