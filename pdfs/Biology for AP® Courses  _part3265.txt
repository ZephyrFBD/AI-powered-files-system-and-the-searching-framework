CHAPTER SUMMARY
27.1 Sensory Processes
A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction)
by a sensory receptor. Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special
senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation.
Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons
that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal
or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors
nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in
space, which is known as that receptorâ€™s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system i
