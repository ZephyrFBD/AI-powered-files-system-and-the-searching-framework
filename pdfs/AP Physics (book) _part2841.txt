FIGURE 25–37 This X-ray
diffraction pattern is one of the first
observed by Max von Laue in 1912
when he aimed a beam of X-rays at
a zinc sulfide crystal. The diffraction
pattern was detected directly on a
photographic plate.

FIGURE 25–39 X-rays can be
diffracted from many possible planes
within a crystal.
EXERCISE G When X-rays of wavelength 
are scattered from a sodium
chloride crystal, a second-order diffraction peak is observed at 21°. What is the spacing
between the planes of atoms for this scattering?
Actual X-ray diffraction patterns are quite complicated. First of all, a crystal
is a three-dimensional object, and X-rays can be diffracted from different planes
at different angles within the crystal, as shown in Fig. 25–39. Although the analysis
is complex, a great deal can be learned from X-ray diffraction about any sub-
stanc
