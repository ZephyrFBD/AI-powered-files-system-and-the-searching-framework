FIGURE 32–11 Liquid-hydrogen bubble-
chamber photograph of an antiproton 
colliding with a proton at rest, producing a 
Xi—anti-Xi pair 
that
subsequently decay into other particles. The
drawing indicates the assignment of
particles to each track, which is based on
how or if that particle decays, and on mass
values estimated from measurement of
momentum (curvature of track in magnetic
field) and energy (thickness of track, for
example). Neutral particle paths are shown
by dashed lines since neutral particles rarely
ionize atoms, around which bubbles form,
and hence leave no tracks. 1950s.

FIGURE 32–12 Emilio Segrè: he
worked with Fermi in the 1930s, later
discovered the first “man-made”
element, technetium, and other
elements, and then the antiproton.
The inscription below the photo is
