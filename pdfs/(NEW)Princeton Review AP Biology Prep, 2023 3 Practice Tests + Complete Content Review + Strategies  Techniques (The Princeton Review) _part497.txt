question. This is an example of Long Question #2.
The regulation of the expression of gene products is crucial to the development of an embryo and the
maintenance of homeostasis. The table below illustrates the mRNA levels, total protein levels, and total
enzyme activity levels for three different enzymes. These enzymes are encoded by genes A, B, and C after
being expressed in both the absence and presence of “Protein X” or “Protein Y.”
a. Describe differences in maintaining homeostasis in unicellular and multicellular organisms.
b. Construct a graph of the Total Enzyme Levels for each of the 3 genes. Be sure to show the
results in the presence and absence of Protein X and Protein Y.
c. Analyze the data and describe the influence of Protein X and Protein Y on the gene
expression of Enzyme A and Enzyme B. Include at which point in gene expression the
regulation likely occurs.
d. Another scientist repeats the experiment with Protein Y and Enzyme C, and adds a known
inhibitor
