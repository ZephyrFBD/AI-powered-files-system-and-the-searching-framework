division with genetic variations.
d.
Small, prokaryotic cells have fewer phospholipids in their membrane. Large, eukaryotic cells have more
transport proteins in their phospholipid bilayer, supporting efficient transport of molecules.

Activity
Create an annotated diagram to explain how approximately 300 million alveoli in a human lung increases
surface area for gas exchange to the size of a tennis court. Use the diagram to explain how the cellular
structures of alveoli, capillaries, and red blood cells allow for rapid diffusion of O2 and CO2 among them.
Think About It
Which of the following cells would likely exchange nutrients and wastes with its environment more efficiently: a
spherical cell with a diameter of 5 μm or a cubed-shaped cell with a side length of 7μm? Provide a quantitative
justification for your answer based on surface area-to-volume ratios.
