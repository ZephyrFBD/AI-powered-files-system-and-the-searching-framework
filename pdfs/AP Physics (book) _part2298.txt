FIGURE 21–2 (a) A current is induced when a magnet is moved toward a coil, momentarily increasing the magnetic 
field through the coil. (b) The induced current is opposite when the magnet is moved away from the coil (
decreases).
Note that the galvanometer zero is at the center of the scale and the needle deflects left or right, depending on the 
direction of the current. In (c), no current is induced if the magnet does not move relative to the coil. It is the 
relative motion that counts here: the magnet can be held steady and the coil moved, which also induces an emf.

1–1 Induced EMF
In his attempt to produce an electric current from a magnetic field, Faraday used
an apparatus like that shown in Fig. 21–1. A coil of wire, X, was connected to a
battery. The current that flowed through X produced a magnetic field that was
intensified by the r
