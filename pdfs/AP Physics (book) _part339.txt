†A review of proportionality is given in Appendix A.
FIGURE 4;5 The bobsled 
accelerates because the team exerts 
a force.
The greater the mass, the less the acceleration for the same net force. The mathe-
matical relation, as Newton argued, is that the acceleration of an object is inversely
proportional to its mass. These relationships are found to hold in general and can
be summarized as follows:
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting
on it, and is inversely proportional to the object’s mass. The direction of the
acceleration is in the direction of the net force acting on the object.
This is Newton’s second law of motion.
Newton’s second law can be written as an equation:
where 
stands for acceleration, m for the mass, and 
for the net force on the
object. The symbol 
(Greek “sigma”) stands for “sum of”;
stands for force,
so
