 biological system (cells, organisms, 
populations, communities, or ecosystems).
(A)
This option is correct. Dish B, which was uncovered, had 20 seeds germinate, 
while the covered dish A had only 12 seeds germinate in the first week.
(B)
This option is incorrect because the only variable was light intensity, and dish B 
did have more seeds germinate when exposed to light versus only 12 seeds in  
dish A, which was not exposed to light.
(C)
This option is incorrect because both dishes had paper towels â€” the paper towels 
were a controlled variable.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Germination occurred more rapidly in the yellow-leaved 
seedlings in dish A and at the same rate in dish B, so the data do not support the 
claim that germination was accelerated in green-leaved seedlings.
