thermodynamic equilibrium constants 
derived from them also have no units. It is therefore common practice to write all types 
of equilibrium constants without units, a practice that we adhere to in this text. In more 
advanced chemistry courses, you may make more rigorous distinctions between concen-
trations and activities. 
Give It Some Thought
If the concentration of N2O4 in an equilibrium mixture is 0.00140 M, what is its 
activity? (Assume the solution is ideal.)

Understanding and Working  
with Equilibrium Constants
Before doing calculations with equilibrium constants, it is valuable to understand what 
the magnitude of an equilibrium constant can tell us about the relative concentrations 
of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture. It is also useful to consider how 
the magnitude of any equilibrium constant depends on how the chemical equation is 
expressed.
The Magnitude of Equilibrium Constants
The magnitude of the equilibrium constant for a reaction gives u
