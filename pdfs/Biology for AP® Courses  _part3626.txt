 into the blood, binding to hemoglobin, or carried as a bicarbonate ion. Several properties of carbon dioxide in the
blood affect its transport. First, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen. About 5 to 7 percent of all carbon
dioxide is dissolved in the plasma. Second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind
to hemoglobin. This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a
molecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed. Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible. Therefore, when
it reaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body.
Third, the majority of carbon dioxide molecules (85 percent) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system.
In this system, carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) within the red blood cells
quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic ac
