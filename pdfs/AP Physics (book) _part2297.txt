 Joseph Henry (1797–1878)
and the Englishman Michael Faraday (1791–1867) independently found that it
was possible. Henry actually made the discovery first. But Faraday published his
results earlier and investigated the subject in more detail. We now discuss this
phenomenon and some of its world-changing applications including the electric
generator.

One of the great laws of physics is
Faraday’s law of induction, which
says that a changing magnetic flux
produces an induced emf. This photo
shows a bar magnet moving into (or
out of) a coil of wire, and the
galvanometer registers an induced
current. This phenomenon of
electromagnetic induction is the
basis for many practical devices,
including generators, alternators,
transformers, magnetic recording on
tape or disk (hard drive), and
computer memory.
