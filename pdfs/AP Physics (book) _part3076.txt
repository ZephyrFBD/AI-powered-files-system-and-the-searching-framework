Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom
†We note, however, that Eq. 27–11 is no longer considered valid, as discussed in the next Chapter.

The electron was discovered using an evacuated cathode ray
tube. The measurement of the charge-to-mass ratio 
of
the electron was done using magnetic and electric fields. The
charge e on the electron was first measured in the Millikan 
oil-drop experiment and then its mass was obtained from the
measured value of the 
ratio.
Quantum theory has its origins in Planck’s quantum hypothesis
that molecular oscillations are quantized: their energy E can only
be integer (n) multiples of hf, where h is Planck’s constant and
f is the natural frequency of oscillation:

This hypothesis explained the spectrum of radiation
