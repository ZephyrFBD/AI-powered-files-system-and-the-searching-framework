olecules is great enough for the molecules in the interior of the liquid to break free 
from their neighbors and enter the gas phase. As a result, bubbles of vapor form within 
the liquid. The boiling point increases as the external pressure increases. The boiling 
point of a liquid at 1 atm (760 torr) pressure is called its normal boiling point. From 
Figure 11.25 we see that the normal boiling point of water is 100 °C.
The time required to cook food in boiling water depends on the water tempera-
ture. In an open container, that temperature is 100 °C, but it is possible to boil at 
higher temperatures. Pressure cookers work by allowing steam to escape only when 
it exceeds a predetermined pressure; the pressure above the water can therefore 
increase above atmospheric pressure. The higher pressure causes the water to boil 
at a higher temperature, thereby allowing the food to get hotter and to cook more 
rapidly.
The effect of pressure on boiling point also explains why it takes longe
