Cl is about 51 g>100 g H2O, whereas NaCl 
has a solubility of about 39 g>100 g H2O. Thus, KCl is more soluble 
than NaCl at this temperature. Figure 13.16 N2 has the same 
molecular weight as CO but is nonpolar, so we can predict that its 
curve will be just below that of CO. Figure 13.22 The water will 
move through the semipermeable membrane toward the more 
concentrated solution. Thus, the liquid level in the left arm will 
increase. Figure 13.23 Water will move toward the more concen-
trated solute solution, which is inside the red blood cells, causing 
them to undergo hemolysis. Figure 13.26 The negatively charged 
groups both have the composition â€”CO2 
-. Figure 13.28 Recall 
the rule that likes dissolve likes. The oil drop is composed of nonpo-
lar molecules, which interact with the nonpolar part of the stearate 
ion via dispersion forces.

than that for the same mass of steel wool, so the reaction with
