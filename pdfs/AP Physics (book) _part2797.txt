 object is placed at the
focal point or just within it. Then the converging lens produces a virtual image,
which must be at least 25 cm from the eye if the eye is to focus on it. If the eye is
relaxed, the image will be at infinity, and in this case the object is exactly at the
focal point. (You make this slight adjustment yourself when you “focus” on the
object by moving the magnifying glass.)

†Simple single-lens magnifiers are limited to about 2 or 
because of blurring due to spherical
aberration (Section 25–6).

A comparison of part (a) of Fig. 25–17 with part (b), in which the same
object is viewed at the near point with the unaided eye, reveals that the angle the
object subtends at the eye is much larger when the magnifier is used. The angular
magnification or magnifying power, M, of the lens is defined as the ratio of the
angle subtended by an object when using the lens, to the angle subtended using
the unaide
