tion of these polymers occurs through dehydration synthesis reactions. The
breakdown of these polymers occurs through hydrolysis reactions.
Important organic macromolecules in biology include:
Carbohydrates: monosaccharides link by glyosidic bonds to form di- and polysaccharides. Examples are
glucose, fructose, glycogen, cellulose, and starch.
Proteins: 20 different amino acids, each with a different R-group, link together via peptide bonds to form
polypeptides. The chain further folds up into special shapes to make the final protein structure. The structure
can be divided into primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets), tertiary
(disulfide bonds), and quaternary (multiple polypeptides).
Lipids: chains called fatty acids (either saturated or unsaturated) combine on a glycerol backbone to form
phospholipids and triglycerides. Cholesterol is another type of lipid. Lipids are hydrophobic.
Nucleic acids: chains of either DNA or RNA nucleotides. They ca
