 lysine is present. Therefore, lysine
has a negative effect on the level of transcription.
(c) This operon is more likely repressible.
(d) Repressible operons have a lower level of expression when the corepressor is present. Since the presence of
lysine decreases the level of expression of the operon, it is more likely that the operon is repressible.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Enhancer sequences function as binding sites for activator proteins or transcription factors. When an
activator or transcription factor binds to an enhancer site, more transcription of the gene occurs.
(b) DNA sequence A is the control because none of the sequences are deleted.
(c) Sequence 1 is most likely the enhancer sequence because the relative levels of THY-1 gene transcription are
lower when sequence 1 is deleted than when sequence 2 or sequence 3 is deleted.
(d) Promoters serve as binding sites for RNA polymerase. If RNA polymerase cannot bind, transcription cannot
occur. If P were deleted, no transcripti
