The Four Parts of Cellular Respiration
A. Glycolysis—a ten-step metabolic pathway, catalyzed by a series of enzymes, which breaks one glucose
molecule down to two molecules of pyruvic acid (pyruvate).
1. The following are the most important features to remember about the glycolysis reaction series:
i.
The bonds of the glucose molecule are rearranged.
ii. NAD+ is reduced to NADH, one of the two electron carriers in cellular respiration.
iii. Free energy is then released in the form of ATP—which comes from ADP and inorganic
phosphates.
iv. Pyruvic acid is produced and is transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria for future
oxidation.
v. The following figure shows the process of glycolysis and its end products:
B. Shuttle Step—the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-CoA occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria and
involves three important features:
1. Coenzyme A (CoA) is added.
2. Pyruvate is oxidized, producing NADH.
3. The 3-carbon pyruvate is converted to the 2
