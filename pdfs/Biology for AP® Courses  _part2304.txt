that
blocks the movement of cells but allows free exchange of
anything smaller than a bacterial cell. On one side of the
filter, a sample of penicillin resistant cells in culture broth
is added, on the second side of the tube, a culture of
penicillin sensitive cells in culture is added. After 24
hours, resistant cells appear on the side with the cells
sensitive to penicillin. Which three genetic mechanisms
can account for appearance of the penicillin resistant cells?
a.
transformation, transduction, and conjugation
b.
transformation, transduction, and mutation
c.
transformation, conjugation, and mutation
