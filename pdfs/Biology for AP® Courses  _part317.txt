m different organisms that has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the
same position in all samples of cytochrome c. This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor.
On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When
human and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid.
In another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position.
The protein sequence of cytochrome c from chimpanzees and humans is identical. The protein sequence of cytochrome
c from rhesus monkeys differs from the human sequence by one amino acid. What do these comparisons suggest?
a.
Rhesus monkeys are more closely related to humans than chimpanzees.
b.
Chimpanzees are more closely related to rhesus monkeys than to humans.
c.
Humans are related to chimpanzees, but are not related to rhesus monkeys.
d.
Chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than rhesus monkeys.
