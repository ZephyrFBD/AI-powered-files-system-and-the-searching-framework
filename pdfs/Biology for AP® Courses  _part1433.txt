use of X inactivation, aberrations in sex
chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects (e.g., Turner syndrome) than aneuploidy. Sometimes segments of
chromosome are duplicated, deleted, or rearranged by inversion or translocation. These aberrations can result in problematic
phenotypic effects. Diagnostic testing can detect many of these chromosomal disorders in individuals well before birth,
resulting in medical, ethical, and civic issues, such as the right to privacy.
A condition in which an organism has more than the normal number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called
polyploidy. Polyploidy resulting in odd numbers of chromosomes is rare because it results in sterile organisms. One set
of chromosomes has no pair so meiosis cannot proceed normally. In contrast, polyploidy resulting in even chromosome
numbers is very common in the plant kingdom. Polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than individuals with the
normal number of chromosomes.
