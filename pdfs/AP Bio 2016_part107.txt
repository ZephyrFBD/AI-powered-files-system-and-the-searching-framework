rm, as 
shown in Figure 2. Researchers also identified a gene in the mosquitoes, OR4, that encodes an olfactory receptor. 
A volatile odorant,  sulcatone, binds to the OR4 receptor. Humans produce higher levels of sulcatone than do 
guinea pigs. 
(a) Based on an analysis of the data, identify the preferred host of the forest form and of the domestic form of 
the mosquito. 
(b) Propose a refinement to the initial experimental design that will rule out the possibility that preference is 
based on a visual cue. Propose a different refinement to the initial experiment to test whether sulcatone is 
the attractant for the human-preferring form. 
(c) Predict how each of the following mutations in the OR4 gene would most likely affect the sensitivity of 
mosquitoes to sulcatone. Justify each prediction. 
A mutation that results in the removal of the intracellular domain of the receptor protein 
A mutation that results in the substitution of a small hydrophobic amino acid for another small
