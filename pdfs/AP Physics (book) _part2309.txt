nduced in a loop due to
a change in magnetic flux inside the loop. To produce
an induced current you need
(a) a closed conducting loop, and
(b) an external magnetic flux through the loop that is
changing in time.
1. Determine whether the magnetic flux 
inside the loop is decreasing, increasing, or unchanged.
(£B = BA cos u)
Practice with Lenz’s law. In which direc-
tion is the current, induced in the circular loop for each situation in Fig. 21–8?
RESPONSE In (a), the magnetic field initially pointing out of the page passes
through the loop. If you pull the loop out of the field, magnetic flux through the
loop decreases; so the induced current will be in a direction to maintain the
decreasing flux through the loop: the current will be counterclockwise to
produce a magnetic field outward (toward the reader).
(b) The external field is into the page. The coil area gets smaller, so the flux will
decrease; hence the induced current will be clockwise, producing its own field
into the page to
