you obtained in part (a)?
 19.73  Acetylene gas, C2H21g2, is used in welding. (a) Write a 
balanced equation for the combustion of acetylene gas 
to CO21g2 and H2O1l2. (b) How much heat is produced 
in burning 1 mol of C2H2 under standard conditions 
if both reactants and products are brought to 298 K? 
 
(c) What is the maximum amount of useful work that 
can be accomplished under standard conditions by this 
reaction?

in burning 1 mol of CH41g2 under standard conditions if 
reactants and products are brought to 298 K and H2O1l2 is 
formed? (b) What is the maximum amount of useful work 
that can be accomplished under standard conditions by 
this system?
