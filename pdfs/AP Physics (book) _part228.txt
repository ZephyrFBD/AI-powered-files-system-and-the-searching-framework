n inter-
section just as the traffic light turns yellow. She knows that
the yellow light lasts only 2.0 s before turning to red, and
she is 28 m away from the near side of the intersection
(Fig. 2–49). Should she try to stop, or should she speed up
to cross the intersection before the light turns red? The
intersection is 15 m wide. Her car’s maximum deceleration
is 
whereas it can accelerate from 
to
in 6.0 s. Ignore the length of her car and her
reaction time.

70. In putting, the force with which a golfer strikes a ball is
planned so that the ball will stop within some small distance
of the cup, say 1.0 m long or short, in case the putt is missed.
Accomplishing this from an uphill lie (that is, putting the
ball downhill, see Fig. 2–47) is more difficult than from a
downhill lie. To see why, assume that on a particular green
the ball decelerates constantly at 
going downhill,
and constantly at 
going uphill. Suppose we have an
uphill lie 7.0
