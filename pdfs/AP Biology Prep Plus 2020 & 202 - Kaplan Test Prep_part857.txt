d have to have a large chance of survival and
the older trees would have to have a much greater chance of dying.
This is not the case for giant sequoia trees. (B) is incorrect because a
Type 2 curve applies to organisms that have a constant death rate,
regardless of the age of the organism. (D) is incorrect because giant
sequoia trees do show a Type 3 survivorship curve.

Learning Objective: 19.5
(A) Elephants bear few young, most of which survive. Therefore, their
curve begins high and stays high, only dropping oﬀ with old age. (B) is
incorrect because elephants do not have a constant death rate
regardless of age. (C) is the opposite of what is true for elephants.
Young animals die infrequently. The death rate increases as elephants
get older. (D) is incorrect because elephants do follow a Type 1
survivorship curve.
