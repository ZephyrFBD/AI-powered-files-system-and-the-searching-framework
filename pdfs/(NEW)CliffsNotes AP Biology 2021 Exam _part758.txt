adogram shows the submitted sequence highlighted in yellow. Other sequences provide species names. A legend
(at the far right) provides a common description for the species.
More detailed information is provided in the second section. Here, each bar of the list of matching sequences is
described in detail.
6. References. You can use a link in this column to get a common name for a species (e.g., Gallus gallus is a
chicken), a description of the sequence (e.g., the sequence is associated with the mRNA that codes for the
connective-tissue protein collagen), the species classification, the matching DNA sequence, the translated amino
acid sequence, and published references.
7. Species. In this column, you are given the name of the species in which the sequence was found and the
beginning of a description of the sequence. Click on the reference (1st column) to get the complete description.
8. Alignment Score. The bigger the alignment score, the greater the similarity to the submitted sequen
