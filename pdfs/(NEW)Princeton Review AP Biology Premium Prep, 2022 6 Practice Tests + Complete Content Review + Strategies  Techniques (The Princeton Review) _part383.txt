or to all life, but where things went from there can become quite convoluted.
Scientists use charts called phylogenetic trees, or cladograms, to study relationships between organisms.
Phylogenetic trees are built using data from the fossil record or molecular record, but the molecular record provides
more specific details. Trees show the amount of change over time, but cladograms just show the change. In other
words, cladograms are often drawn with even spacing between species, but phylogenetic trees are often drawn with
different distances between species and as a result they look more like a tree with uneven branches. Both types are
hypotheses and thus they constantly change as more data is uncovered to establish the relationships between species.
They always begin with the common ancestor and then branch out. Anytime there is a fork in the road, it is called a
common ancestor node. These common ancestors likely do not exist anymore, but they are the point at which
evolution went in
