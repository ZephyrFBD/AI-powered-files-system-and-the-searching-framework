represented by the area of the rectangles). The 4s, 
4p, and 3d bands can hold 2, 6, and 10 electrons per atom, respectively, corresponding to 
two per orbital, as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle. 
 (Section 6.7) The energy 
range spanned by the 3d band is smaller than the range spanned by the 4s and 4p bands 
because the 3d orbitals are smaller and, therefore, overlap with orbitals on neighboring 
atoms less effectively.
Many properties of metals can be understood from Figure 12.23. We can think of 
the energy band as a partially filled container for electrons. The incomplete filling of 
the energy band gives rise to characteristic metallic properties. The electrons in orbitals 
near the top of the occupied levels require very little energy input to be “promoted” to 
higher-energy orbitals that are unoccupied. Under the influence of any source of exci-
tation, such as an applied electrical potential or an input of thermal energy, electrons 
move into previously vacant levels
