Two populations of finches on Isla Santa Cruz, in the Galapagos
Islands in Ecuador, are isolated from each other. Although their
population density is the same, one population is significantly larger
than the other. A new bacterial infection has rapidly spread across
the entire island, attacking, among others, both populations of
finches.
Which of the following statements best predicts how the new
infection will affect the two populations and provides the correct
reasoning for that prediction?
The smaller population will be less affected because there will
be fewer individuals in that population that could become ill.
The larger population will be more affected because, as a result
of more individuals in that population, there will be more
mutations that will make more individuals vulnerable.
The larger population wil
