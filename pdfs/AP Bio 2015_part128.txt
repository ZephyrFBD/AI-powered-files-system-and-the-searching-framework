Question 7 
In the early nineteenth century, Alexander von Humboldt observed that the distribution of plants up a 
mountainside mirrors the distribution of plants at increasing latitude. A number of modern studies have 
reinforced the idea that as the global climate warms, plant species are becoming redistributed to higher 
elevations or latitudes. 
However, in a separate large-scale study comparing historical (1930–1935) plant distributions with modern 
(2000–2005) distributions in the western United States, researchers observed that 72% of identified plant 
species shifted to lower elevations despite an associated increase in average tempe
