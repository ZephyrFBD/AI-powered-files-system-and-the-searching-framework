ral uranium
is 99.3 percent 
which in a breeder becomes useful fissionable 
thus
increasing the supply of fissionable fuel by more than a factor of 100. But breeder
reactors have the same problems as other reactors, plus other serious problems.
Not only is plutonium a serious health hazard in itself (radioactive with a half-life
of 24,000 years), but plutonium produced in a reactor can readily be used in a bomb,
increasing the danger of nuclear proliferation and theft of fuel to produce a bomb.

Nuclear power presents risks. Other large-scale energy-conversion methods,
such as conventional oil and coal-burning steam plants, also present health and
environmental hazards; some of them were discussed in Section 15–11, and include
air pollution, oil spills, and the release of 
gas which can trap heat as in a
greenhouse to raise the Earth’s temperature. The solution to the wor
