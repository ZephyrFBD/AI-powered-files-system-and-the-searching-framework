formed by a decomposition reaction. (a) If the blue spheres 
represent N atoms and the red ones represent O atoms, 
what was the empirical formula of the original compound? 
 
(b) Could you draw a diagram representing the molecules 
of the compound that had been decomposed? Why or why 
not? [Section 3.2 ]
