then needs 19.85 mL of 0.1020 M NaOH for neutralization. 
Calculate the percentage by mass of magnesium hydroxide 
in the sample, assuming that it is the only substance reacting 
with the HCl solution.
 4.90 A 1.248-g sample of limestone rock is pulverized and then 
treated with 30.00 mL of 1.035 M HCl solution. The excess 
acid then requires 11.56 mL of 1.010 M NaOH for neutraliza-
tion. Calculate the percentage by mass of calcium carbonate 
in the rock, assuming that it is the only substance reacting 
with the HCl solution.
 4.94 You choose to investigate some of the solubility guide-
lines for two ions not listed in Table 4.1, the chromate ion 
1CrO4
2-2 and the oxalate ion 1C2O4
2 -2. You are given 0.01 M 
solutions (A, B, C, D) of four water-soluble salts:
