 and fluids from accessory glands
that contribute most of the semen’s volume. Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum as a tail, a neck that contains
the cell’s energy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material. Figure 34.11 shows a micrograph
of human sperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm. An acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm.
This structure contains lysosomal enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg to help the sperm
penetrate and fertilize the egg. An ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid with from 50–120 million sperm
per milliliter.
