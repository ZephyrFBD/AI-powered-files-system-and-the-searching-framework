ture (T), 
and quantity (n). Volume is usually measured in liters, temperature in 
kelvins, and quantity of gas in moles. Pressure is the force per unit area 
and is expressed in SI units as pascals, Pa 11 Pa = 1 N>m22. A related 
unit, the bar, equals 105 Pa. In chemistry, standard atmospheric pressure is 
used to define the atmosphere (atm) and the torr (also called the millime-
ter of mercury). One atmosphere of pressure equals 101.325 kPa, or 760 
torr. A barometer is often used to measure the atmospheric pressure. A 
manometer can be used to measure the pressure of enclosed gases.
THE GAS LAWS (SECTION 10.3) Studies have revealed several sim-
ple gas laws: For a constant quantity of gas at constant temperature, 
the volume of the gas is inversely proportional to the pressure (Boyle’s 
law). For a fixed quantity of gas at constant pressure, the volume is di-
rectly proportional to its absolute temperature (Charles’s law). Equal 
volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure
