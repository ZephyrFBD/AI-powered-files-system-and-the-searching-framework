cular isothermal expansion is 
reversible or irreversible? Because the gas expands into a vacuum with no external pres-
sure, it does no P9V work on the surroundings. 
 (Section 5.3) Thus, for the expansion, 
w = 0. We can use the piston to compress the gas back to its original state, but doing so 
requires that the surroundings do work on the system, meaning that w 7 0 for the com-
pression. In other words, the path that restores the system to its original state requires a 
different value of w (and, by the first law, a different value of q) than the path by which 
the system was first changed. The fact that the same path cannot be followed to restore 
the system to its original state indicates that the process is irreversible.
What might a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas be? This process will 
occur only if initially, when the gas is confined to half the cylinder, the external pressure 
acting on the piston exactly balances the pressure exerted by the gas on the pisto
