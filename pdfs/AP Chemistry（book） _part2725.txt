n of NaOH. Which 
of the following statements is not true of this titration?
(a) The HCl solution is less concentrated than the NaOH solu-
tion. (b) The pH is less than 7 after adding 25 mL of NaOH 
solution. (c) The pH at the equivalence point is 7.00. (d) If an 
additional 1.00 mL of NaOH solution is added beyond the 
equivalence point, the pH of the solution is more than 7.00.  
(e) At the equivalence point, the OH- concentration in the 
solution is 3.67 * 10-3 M.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the pH when (a) 24.9 mL and (b) 25.1 mL of 
0.100 M HNO3 have been added to 25.0 mL of 0.100 M KOH 
solution.
In this case, the volume in the titration ﬂask is:
50.0 mL + 51.0 mL = 101.0 mL = 0.1010 L
reaction with water cannot be neglected, and the pH at the equivalence point is 
therefore greater than 7. In general, the pH at the equivalence point is always above 
7 in a weak acid–strong base titration because the anion of the salt formed is a weak 
base. The procedure for calculating the
