, and the arrows are longer (faster speeds) for galaxies more distant from
us. Now, what if we were on the galaxy labeled A in Fig. 33–22a? From Earth,
galaxy A appears to be moving to the right at a velocity, call it 
represented by
the arrow pointing to the right. If we were on galaxy A, Earth would appear to be
moving to the left at velocity 
To determine the velocities of other galaxies
relative to A, we vectorially add the velocity vector,
to all the velocity arrows
shown in Fig. 33–22a. This yields Fig. 33–22b, where we see that the universe 
is expanding away from galaxy A as well; and the velocities of galaxies receding
from A are proportional to their current distance from A. The universe looks
pretty much the same from different points.
Thus the expansion of the universe can be stated as follows: all galaxies are
racing away from each other at an average rate of about 
per million light-
years of distance between them. The ramifications of this idea are profound, and
we discu
