Carbon black is used as a pigment in black inks; large amounts are also used in making 
automobile tires.
Charcoal is formed when wood is heated strongly in the absence of air. Charcoal 
has an open structure, giving it an enormous surface area per unit mass. “Activated char-

widely used to adsorb molecules. It is used in filters to remove offensive odors from air 
and colored or bad-tasting impurities from water.
