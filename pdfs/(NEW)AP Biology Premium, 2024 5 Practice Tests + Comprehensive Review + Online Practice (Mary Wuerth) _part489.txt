f the
AA and aa genotypes and the frequency of the Aa genotype would decrease. Choice (B) is incorrect because the
frequency of the AA genotype would increase (not decrease) and the frequency of the Aa genotype would
decrease (not increase). If the parasite was eliminated, there would be no advantage to having the Aa genotype.
So the frequency of the Aa genotype would no longer be favored and would be expected to decrease, not
increase, and the frequencies of the AA and aa genotypes would increase. Thus, choice (C) is incorrect. While
the frequency of the aa genotype would be expected to increase, the frequency of the AA genotype would also
be expected to increase. So choice (D) is incorrect.

11. (a) If the allele frequencies in a population are changing, the population is evolving. So looking at allele
frequencies in a population over time can help determine if the population is evolving.
(b) The frequency of the A1 allele decreased from generation 1 to generation
