then has a meas-
ured mass of 1.008665 u, a proton 1.007276 u, and a neutral hydrogen atom 
(proton plus electron) 1.007825 u. The masses of many nuclides are given in
Appendix B. It should be noted that the masses in this Table, as is customary, are for
the neutral atom (including electrons), and not for a bare nucleus.
Masses may be specified using the electron-volt energy unit,
(Section 17–4). This can be done because mass and energy are related, and the
precise relationship is given by Einstein’s equation
(Chapter 26). Since
the mass of a proton is 
or 1.007276 u, then 1 u is equal to
this is equivalent to an energy (see Table inside front cover) in 
of
Thus,
The rest masses of some of the basic particles are given in Table 30–1. As a rule
of thumb, to remember, the masses of neutron and proton are about 
which is about 2000 times the mass of an electron AL
