enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP
to the amino acid tyrosine. Before the ligand binds, the receptors
exist as individual units. After binding, the individual units
aggregate and activate the tyrosine kinase region, which bonds to
ATP. Once fully activated, the receptor activates specific relay
proteins that each lead to a cellular response. See Figure 3.24.

WHEN THE RECEPTORS ARE LOCATED INSIDE THE
CELL
Small, nonpolar ligands diffuse directly through the plasma membrane and
bind to an intracellular receptor in the cytoplasm. Such hydrophobic
chemical messengers include steroids, thyroid hormones, and NO, nitric
oxide, a gas, that readily diffuse into the cell and switch a gene on or off in
