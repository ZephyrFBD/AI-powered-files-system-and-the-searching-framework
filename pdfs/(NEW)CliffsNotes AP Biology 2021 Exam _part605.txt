elegans, has been an important model for the study of development. A complete
lineage map tracing the fates of every cell during its development has been described. Every one of the 959 cells in
an adult are traced back to the egg, cell division by cell division.
Since all of the cells created during embryonic development originate from the same original zygote, they each
contain copies of the same chromosomes with the same DNA sequences. What, then, causes cells to become
structurally and functionally different within the same individual? Why does one cell mature into a muscle cell and
another into a nerve cell? A summary of mechanisms responsible for influencing cell development and
differentiation follows:
1. Indeterminate and determinate cleavages. Cleavages do not necessarily divide a cell into equal parts. Instead,
cells acquire variations based upon the orientation of the cleavage. A cleavage is indeterminate if it produces
daughter cells that, if separated, can individually com
