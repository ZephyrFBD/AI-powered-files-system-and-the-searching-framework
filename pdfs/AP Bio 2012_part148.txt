and temporal scales.
Learning Objective 
1.5: The student is able to connect evolutionary changes in 
a population over time to a change in the environment. 
(A)
This option is incorrect. It implies that evolution occurs according to “need,” or in 
order to cause a certain outcome.
(B)
This option is incorrect because it is contrary to fact; the plasmid does not confer 
resistance to the new antibiotic.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding that the plasmid 
would remain in the population even though it is not favored by selection and 
because it is not being selected against.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the methicillin-resistance plasmid does not 
confer any resistance to the new antibiotic in bacteria.
