bic running capacity (LCR) and high intrinsic aerobic running
capacity (HCR). Aȇer 19 generations of artificial selection, these
rats diﬀer greatly in their athletic ability. HCR rats can run much
farther than LCR rats before reaching exhaustion. Although the
researchers selected for running capacity, the rats diﬀer in other
ways. The table below shows some characteristics of the two
lines. The figure below shows the time, in minutes, to heart failure
in hypoxic conditions.

If the researchers selected for running capacity, why do the rats
diﬀer in these other ways?
