The more points you score, the better oﬀ you are on that question.
The AP Biology people have a rubric, which acts as a blueprint for
what a good answer should look like—we feature similar rubrics in
the explanations to our free-response questions, so you have an
idea of what these might look like. Every subsection of a question
has one to five key ideas attached to it. If you write about one of
those ideas, you earn yourself a point. There’s a limit to how many
points you can earn on a single subquestion, but it boils down to
2.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Don’t forget—you only receive points for relevant correct
information; you receive no points for incorrect information or for
restating the question, which also eats up valuable time!
Beyond these points, there’s a bit of a risk in the free-response section
because there are only eight questions. If you get a question on a subject
you’re weak in, things might look grim. Still, take heart. Quite oȇen, you’ll
earn some points on every question
