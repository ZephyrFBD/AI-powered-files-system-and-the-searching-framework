om space on a volume and
scale that goes on increasing by the day. Elon Musk’s (oﬃcially)
SpaceX Starlink project is in the process of puĴing tens of thousands
of satellites in low orbit to cover every inch of the planet with 5G
and other Wi-Fi to create Kurzweil’s global ‘cloud’ to which the
human mind is planned to be aĴached very soon. SpaceX has
approval to operate 12,000 satellites with more than 1,300 launched
at the time of writing and applications ﬁled for 30,000 more. Other
operators in the Wi-Fi, 5G, low-orbit satellite market include
OneWeb (UK), Telesat (Canada), and AST & Science (US). Musk tells
us that AI could be the end of humanity and then launches a
company called Neuralink to connect the human brain to computers.
Musk’s (in theory) Tesla company is building electric cars and the
driverless vehicles of the smart control grid. As frauds and
bullshiĴers go Elon Musk in my opinion is Major League.
5G and technological radiation in general are destructive to
human health
