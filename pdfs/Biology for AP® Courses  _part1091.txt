29. What characteristics make yeast a good model for
learning about signaling in humans?
a.
Yeasts are prokaryotes. They have a short life
cycle, easy to grow, and share similarities with
humans in certain regulating mechanisms.
b.
Yeasts are eukaryotes. They have a short life
cycle, easy to grow, and share similarities with
humans in certain regulating mechanisms.
c.
Yeasts are multicellular organisms. They have a
short life cycle, easy to grow, and share
similarities with humans in certain regulating
mechanisms.
d.
Yeasts are single celled organisms. They have a
complex life cycle like that of humans and share
similarities in regulating mechanisms.
30. Why is signaling in multicellular organisms more
complicated than signaling in single-celled organisms?
a.
Multicellular organisms coordinate between
distantly located cells; single-celled organisms
communicate only with nearby cell
