have inspired him to the conclusion
that the period of a pendulum does
not depend on amplitude.

Pendulum clock
Because a pendulum does not undergo precisely SHM, the period does depend
slightly on the amplitude—the more so for large amplitudes. The accuracy of a
pendulum clock would be affected, after many swings, by the decrease in amplitude
due to friction. But the mainspring in a pendulum clock (or the falling weight in a
grandfather clock) supplies energy to compensate for the friction and to maintain
the amplitude constant, so that the timing remains precise.
