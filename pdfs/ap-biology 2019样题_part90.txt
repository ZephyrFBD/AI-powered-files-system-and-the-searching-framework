o-volume ratio and 
more efficient exchange of materials with 
the environment.
b.	As cells increase in volume, the relative 
surface area decreases and the demand for 
internal resources increases. 
c. More complex cellular structures 
(e.g., membrane folds) are necessary 
to adequately exchange materials with 
he environment. 
d. As organisms increase in size, their surface 
area-to-volume ratio decreases, affecting 
properties like rate of heat exchange with 
the environment. 
ENE-1.C
Explain how specialized 
structures and strategies 
are used for the efficient 
exchange of molecules to 
the environment.
ENE-1.C.1
Organisms have evolved highly efficient 
strategies to obtain nutrients and 
eliminate wastes. Cells and organisms use 
specialized exchange surfaces to obtain 
and release molecules from or into the 
surrounding environment.
