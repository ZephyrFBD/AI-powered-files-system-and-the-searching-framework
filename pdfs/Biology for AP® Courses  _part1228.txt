will make their way into the gametes.
Figure 11.4 Random, independent assortment during metaphase I can be demonstrated by considering a cell with a
set of two chromosomes (n = 2). In this case, there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase
I. The total possible number of different gametes is 2n, where n equals the number of chromosomes in a set. In this
example, there are four possible genetic combinations for the gametes. With n = 23 in human cells, there are over 8
million possible combinations of paternal and maternal chromosomes.
Anaphase I
In anaphase I, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart. The sister chromatids remain tightly bound together
at the centromere. The chiasmata are broken in anaphase I as the microtubules attached to the fused kinetochores pull the
homologous chromosomes apart (Figure 11.5).
