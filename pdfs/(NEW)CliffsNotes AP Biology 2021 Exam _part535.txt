pothalamus and the pituitary gland, a gland attached to the base of the hypothalamus. Neurosecretory cells are
structured like neurons, but rather than secreting neurotransmitters into synapses that affect neighboring neurons,
they secrete hormones into the blood. There are two halves, or lobes, of the pituitary. Their special associations with
the hypothalamus are described below:
1. Posterior pituitary. Hormones produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus are stored in the posterior
pituitary and released as needed. One of these is ADH (antidiuretic hormone), discussed in “The Excretory
System,” later in this chapter.
2. Anterior pituitary. Releasing hormones are produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus and secreted
into the blood. This blood flows directly to the anterior pituitary, where the releasing hormones stimulate the release
of tropic hormones produced in the anterior pituitary. Tropic hormones are hormones whose target cells are other
endocrine glands.
