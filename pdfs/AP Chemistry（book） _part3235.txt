In essence, the interior of the cell and the ECF together serve as a vol-
taic cell. The negative sign for the potential indicates that work is re-
quired to move K+ into the ICF.
Changes in the relative concentrations of the ions in the ECF 
and ICF lead to changes in the emf of the voltaic cell. The cells of 
the heart that govern the rate of heart contraction are called the 
pacemaker cells. The membranes of the cells regulate the concen-
trations of ions in the ICF, allowing them to change in a systematic 
way. The concentration changes cause the emf to change in a cyclic 
fashion, as shown in Figure 20.16. The emf cycle determines the 
rate at which the heart beats. If the pacemaker cells malfunction 
because of disease or injury, an artiﬁcial pacemaker can b
