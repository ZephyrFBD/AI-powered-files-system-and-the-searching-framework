 a bat and pops straight up to a height of 31.5 m. If
the contact time between bat and ball is 2.5 ms, calculate
the average force between the ball and bat during contact.
13. (III) Air in a 120-km/h wind strikes head-on the face of a
building 45 m wide by 75 m high and is brought to rest. If
air has a mass of 1.3 kg per cubic meter, determine the
average force of the wind on the building.

14. (III) A 725-kg two-stage rocket is traveling at a speed of
away from Earth when a predesigned
explosion separates the rocket into two sections of equal
mass that then move with a speed of 
relative
to each other along the original line of motion. (a) What is
the speed and direction of each section (relative to Earth)
after the explosion? (b) How much energy was supplied by
the explosion? [Hint: What is the change in kinetic energy
as a result of the explosion?]
