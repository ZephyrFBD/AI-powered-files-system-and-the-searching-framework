art III: Comparing Fruit Fly Preferences
In this part of the investigation, you design an experiment to determine the degree of preference that fruit flies have
for chemicals. In other words, you determine which chemical is their favorite, which is their least favorite, and
preferences of the remaining chemicals that fall in between. Pair each chemical with every other chemical in a two-
pole (two-ended) choice chamber or test multiple chemicals at once with a multi-pole chamber. Collect your data
into a table (Figure 17-8).

significant.
The AP exam may ask you to design an experiment similar to the one you completed in this lab. Begin by selecting
a type of organism and observing them in the absence of applied stimuli. Then, change the environment by
introducing a stimulus. Only one stimulus should be applied at a time. In the investigation that you completed above,
that one stimulus was a chemica
