o electron domains orient in a linear electron-domain geometry (Table 9.1). 
Because neither domain is a nonbonding pair of electrons, the molecular geometry is 
also linear, and the O ¬C ¬O bond angle is 180°.
Sample Exercise 9.1 
Using the VSEPR Model
Use the VSEPR model to predict the molecular geometry of (a) O3, (b) SnCl3
-.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the molecular formulas of a molecule and a 
polyatomic ion, both conforming to the general formula ABn and 
both having a central atom from the p block of the periodic table. 
(Notice that for O3, the A and B atoms are all oxygen atoms.)
Plan To predict the molecular geometries, we draw their Lewis struc-
tures and count electron domains around the central atom to get the 
electron-domain geometry. We then obtain the molecular geometry 
from the arrangement of the domains that are due to bonds.
Solve
(a) We can draw two resonance structures for O3:
 
Because of resonance, the bonds between the central O atom and the outer O 
atoms
