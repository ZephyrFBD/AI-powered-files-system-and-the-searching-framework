The steam drives an 
electric generator, 
creating electricity.
Heat is transferred to an 
external source of 
water, condensing the 
secondary coolant, 
which is pumped back 
to the heat exchanger.

*The reactor core cannot reach supercritical levels and explode with the violence of an atomic 
bomb because the concentration of uranium-235 is too low. However, if the core overheats, suf-
ficient damage can lead to release of radioactive materials into the environment.

nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011 occurred when a tsunami damaged 
the reactor cooling systems, resulting in a large-scale release of radioactive materials.
Although about two-thirds of all commercial reactors are p
