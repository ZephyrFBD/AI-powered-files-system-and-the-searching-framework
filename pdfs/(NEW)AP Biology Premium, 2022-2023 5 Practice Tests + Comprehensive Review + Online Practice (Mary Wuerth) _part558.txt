 Larger animals that tried to eat cane toads died from the toxins the cane toads produced. Cane toads have
led to the extinction of many native species in Australia.
Human impacts can also cause disruptions to ecosystems. Habitat destruction (as new cities are built) can lead to
decreased biodiversity. When humans move into a previously uninhabited area, new diseases may be introduced into
the ecosystem. Humans may also come into contact with previously unknown diseases when they move into new
areas. Humans also generate pollution that can make water sources less habitable for other species.
Geological events, such as volcanic eruptions, can also disrupt ecosystems, leading to changes in biodiversity.
Severe weather events, such as hurricanes, can decrease plant and animal diversity in an area. Prolonged droughts
can change the biodiversity of an ecosystem.
These disruptions in ecosystems can lead to the evolution of populations. Environments will select for
adaptations that provide an
