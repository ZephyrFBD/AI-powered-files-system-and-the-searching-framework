If all inhibitions are in effect, which of the following correctly
identifies the product or products formed and the reason for why the
product or products formed?
G and H, because they are the end products of the longest
pathway
C, because G and H inhibit the production of E and F, and D
inhibits the production of B
C, because it is the shortest pathway
B and C, because G and H inhibit the production of E and F,
but D does not always inhibit the production of B
Which of the following is correct about enzymes?
Enzymes are proteins that exhibit tertiary structure.
The bond between an e
