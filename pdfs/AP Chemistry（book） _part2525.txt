left. This situation 
occurs when HA is a weak acid. For example, an aqueous solution of acetic acid consists 
mainly of CH3COOH molecules with relatively few H3O+ and CH3COO -  ions:
 
CH3COOH1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H3O+1aq2 + CH3COO -1aq2 
[16.11]
The CH3COO -  ion is a stronger base than H2O (Figure 16.4) and therefore the reverse 
reaction is favored more than the forward reaction.
From these examples, we conclude that in every acid–base reaction, equilibrium favors 
transfer of the proton from the stronger acid to the stronger base to form the weaker acid and the 
weaker base.
