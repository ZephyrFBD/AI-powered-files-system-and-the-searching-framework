Energy can be transformed from one form to another. For example, a rock
held high in the air has potential energy; as it falls, it loses potential energy and
gains in kinetic energy. Potential energy is being transformed into kinetic energy.
Often the transformation of energy involves a transfer of energy from one
object to another. The potential energy stored in the spring of Fig. 6–13b is 
transformed into the kinetic energy of the ball, Fig. 6–13c. Water at the top of a
waterfall (Fig. 6–24) or a dam has potential energy, which is transformed into
kinetic energy as the water falls. At the base of a dam, the kinetic energy of the
water can be transferred to turbine blades and further transformed into electric
energy, as discussed later. The potential energy stored in a bent bow can be 
transformed into kinetic energy of the arrow (Fig. 6–25).
In each of these examples, the transfer of energy is accompanied by the 
performance of work. The spring of Fig. 6–1
