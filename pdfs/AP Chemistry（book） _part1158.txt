s in their valence orbitals. This 
similarity in valence electronic structure leads to the similarities among 
elements in the same group. Differences among elements in the same 
group arise because their valence orbitals are in different shells.
EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR CHARGE (SECTION 7.2) Many properties of 
atoms depend on the effective nuclear charge, which is the portion of 
the nuclear charge that an outer electron experiences after account-
ing for repulsions by other electrons in the atom. The core electrons 
are very effective in screening the outer electrons from the full charge 
of the nucleus, whereas electrons in the same shell do not screen 
each other very effectively. Because the actual nuclear charge in-
creases as we progress through a period, the effective nuclear charge 
experienced by valence electrons increases as we move left to right 
across a period.
SIZES OF ATOMS AND IONS (SECTION 7.3) The size of an atom 
can be gauged by its bonding atomic radius, which is based
