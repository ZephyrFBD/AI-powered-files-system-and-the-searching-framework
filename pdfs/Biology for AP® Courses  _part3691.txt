 of nucleated red blood cells
is that these cells can undergo mitosis. Anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use
of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce ATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport.
Not all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport. Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood
use different pigments to bind to the oxygen. These pigments use copper or iron to bind the oxygen. Invertebrates have
a variety of other respiratory pigments. Hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in Figure 31.6b
is found in mollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods. Chlorocruorin, a green-colored, iron-containing pigment is
found in four families of polychaete tubeworms. Hemerythrin, a red, iron-containing protein is found in some polychaete
worms and annelids and is illustrated in Figure 31.6c. Despite the name, hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and
