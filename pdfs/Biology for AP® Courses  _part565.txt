phobic parts of the
cell membrane. Facilitated transport proteins shield these materials from the repulsive force of the membrane, allowing
them to diffuse into the cell.
The material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma
membrane. This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are
then passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage. Some of these integral proteins are collections of beta
pleated sheets that form a pore or channel through the phospholipid bilayer. Others are carrier proteins which bind with the
substance and aid its diffusion through the membrane.
Channels
The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function
as either channels for the material or carriers. In both cases, they are transmembrane proteins. Channels are specific
for the substance
