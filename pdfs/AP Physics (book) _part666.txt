*14. (III) A 17,000-kg jet takes off from an aircraft carrier via 
a catapult (Fig. 6–39a). The gases thrust out from the 
jet’s engines exert a constant force of 130 kN on the jet;
the force exerted on the jet by the catapult is plotted in 
Fig. 6–39b. Determine the work done on the jet: (a) by 
the gases expelled by its engines during launch of the jet;
and (b) by the catapult during launch of the jet.

39. (II) A vertical spring (ignore its mass), whose spring con-
stant is 
is attached to a table and is compressed
down by 0.160 m. (a) What upward speed can it give to a
0.380-kg ball when released? (b) How high above its original
position (spring compressed) will the ball fly?
