oundings only as heat; no work is  
performed. (b) A battery discharged through  
a motor loses energy as work (to make the  
fan turn) and also loses some energy as heat.  
The value of ∆E is the same for both  
processes even though the values of q and w  
in (a) are different from those in (b).
5.3 ∣ Enthalpy
The chemical and physical changes that occur around us, such as photosynthesis in the leaves 
of a plant, evaporation of water from a lake, or a reaction in an open beaker in a laboratory, 
occur under the essentially constant pressure of Earth’s atmosphere.* These changes can result 
in the release or absorption of heat and can be accompanied by work done by or on the system. 
In exploring these changes, it is useful to have a thermodynamic function that is a state func-
tion and relates mainly to heat flow. Under conditions of constant pressure, a thermodynamic 
quantity called enthalpy (from the Greek enthalpein, “to warm”) provides such a function.
Enthalpy, which we denote
