three to five sequences (such as the sequences they download from  
http://blogging4biology.edublogs.org/2010/08/28/college-board-lab-files/). 
Which ones are more similar/less similar to one another? Once students understand the 
principle behind matching alignments, they can even calculate the percentage similarity 
by dividing the number of matching sequence bases by the total number compared. The 
following is a simplified example of the concept: 
Organism A Sequence: ATGATCCAGT 
Organism B Sequence: ACGACTCAGT 
Organism C Sequence: TTGATCCAGT 
In addition, you can have students align gene sequences on paper to simulate what the 
BLAST program is doing for them. When uploaded into the BLAST website, each gene 
sequence will appear in the query sequence. Students can copy the gene sequence on 
paper and compare it to the results once the gene is submitted on the BLAST website.
