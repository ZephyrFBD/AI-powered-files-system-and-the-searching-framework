idoglycan, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or protein-based cell walls. Bacteria can be divided
into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on the Gram stain reaction. Gram-positive organisms
have a thick cell wall, together with teichoic acids. Gram-negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer envelope
containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins.
22.3 Prokaryotic Metabolism
Prokaryotes are the most metabolically diverse organisms; they flourish in many different environments with various
carbon energy and carbon sources, variable temperature, pH, pressure, and water availability. Nutrients required in large
amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in trace amounts are called micronutrients or trace elements.
Macronutrients include C, H, O, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, and Na. In addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require
various metallic elements for growth and enzyme function. Prokaryotes use different sources of energy to assemble
