bnormal p53 protein cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis.

Human papillomavirus can cause cervical cancer. The virus encodes E6, a protein that binds p53. Based on this fact
and what you know about p53, what effect do you think E6 binding has on p53 activity?
a.
E6 activates p53
b.
E6 inactivates p53
c.
E6 mutates p53
d.
E6 binding marks p53 for degradation
The loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle. Mutated p53 might lose its ability to trigger p21
production. Without adequate levels of p21, there is no effective block on Cdk activation. Essentially, without a fully
functional p53, the G1 checkpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from G1 to S regardless of internal
and external conditions. At the completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter cells are produced that have inherited
the mutated p53 gene. Given the non
