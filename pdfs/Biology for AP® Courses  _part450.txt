In addition to the presence of nuclei, eukaryotic cells are distinguished by an endomembrane system that includes the
plasma membrane, nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. These subcellular
components work together to modify, tag, package, and transport proteins and lipids. The rough endoplasmic reticulum
(RER) with its attached ribosomes is the site of protein synthesis and modification. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum
(SER) synthesizes carbohydrates, lipids including phospholipids and cholesterol, and steroid hormones; engages in the
detoxification of medications and poisons; and stores calcium ions.
