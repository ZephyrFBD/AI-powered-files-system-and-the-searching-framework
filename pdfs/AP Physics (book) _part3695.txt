The
size of the star is no longer limited by the exclusion principle applied to electrons,
but rather by neutron degeneracy pressure, and the star contracts rapidly to form
an enormously dense neutron star. The core of a neutron star contracts to the
point at which all neutrons are as close together as they are in an atomic nucleus.
That is, the density of a neutron star is on the order of 
times greater than
normal solids and liquids on Earth. A cupful of such dense matter would weigh
billions of tons. A neutron star that has a mass 1.5 times that of our Sun would
have a diameter of only about 20 km. (Compare this to a white dwarf with 1 solar
mass whose diameter would be
, as mentioned on the previous page.)
The contraction of the core of a massive star would mean a great reduction in
gravitational potential energy. Somehow this energy would have to be released.
Indeed, it was suggested in the 1930s that the final core collapse to a neutron star
could be accompanied by a catastrophic
