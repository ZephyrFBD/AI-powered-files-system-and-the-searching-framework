Green pea plants can result from either a homozygous dominant (GG) or a heterozygous (Gg) phenotype,
so your mystery pea plant could be either. You need to figure out which it is. If you cross it with any
green plant, (A), you won’t know what genotype you are crossing it with. If you cross it with a
homozygous dominant plant, (B), you will always get green plants no matter what your original mystery
plant was. If you cross it with a yellow plant, then you will know it is a homozygous recessive. If your
original plant is a homozygous dominant, you will get only green plants. If your original plant is a
heterozygote, then you should get yellow plants 50% of the time.
