n seawater, whose concentrations of constituent 
ions are listed in Table 18.5, and that the desalinated 
water output has an effective molarity of about 0.02 M. 
What minimum pressure must be applied by hand pump-
ing at 297 K to cause reverse osmosis to occur? (Hint: Refer 
to Section 13.5.)
 18.47  List the common products formed when an organic mate-
rial containing the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, 
sulfur, and nitrogen decomposes (a) under aerobic condi-
tions, (b) under anaerobic conditions.
 18.48  (a) Explain why the concentration of dissolved oxygen in 
freshwater is an important indicator of the quality of the 
water. (b) Find graphical data in the text that show varia-
tions of gas solubility with temperature, and estimate to 
two significant figures the percent solubility of O2 in water 
at 30 °C as compared with 20 °C. How do these data relate 
to the quality of natural waters?
