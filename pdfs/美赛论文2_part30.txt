The collaborative optimization scheduling model has two objective functions: 
Minimizing the total cost of delivery (f1); Minimizing the total delivery time f2 
Object1: Minimize the total cost of delivery (f1): 
   The cost can be divided into 2 parts, one contains the cost of delivering vaccine 
and drugs from treatment center to each epidemic area, and the other part is the cost 
of delivering vaccine and drugs between epidemic areas. The two parts of cost are 
respectively as follows: 
       TC1j = C1j ∗⌈
w∗y1j
c1 ⌉                                         （1）
 
      TC2ij = C2ij ∗⌈
w∗y2ij
c2 ⌉                                        （2）
 
⌈x⌉ means to round up the value to an integer, e.g.⌈3.2⌉=4 
Function (1) expresses the cost of delivering vaccine and drugs from treatment 
 center to epidemic area Aj (j=1,2, …, 14) 
Function (2) means the cost of delivering vaccine and drugs between epidemic 
areas Ai and Aj ( i, j=1,2, …, 14, i≠j) 
Object 2：Minimize the total delivery
