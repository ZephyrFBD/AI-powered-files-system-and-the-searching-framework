mperature dropped. Not long
before the temperature had fallen to 
3000 K, some 380,000 years later, could nuclei
and electrons combine together as stable atoms. With the disappearance of free elec-
trons, as they combined with nuclei to form atoms, the radiation would have been
freed—decoupled from matter, we say. The universe became transparent because
photons were now free to travel nearly unimpeded straight through the universe.
It is this radiation, from 380,000 years after the birth of the universe, that we
now see as the CMB. As the universe expanded, so too the wavelengths of the
radiation lengthened, thus redshifting to longer wavelengths that correspond to
lower temperature (recall Wien’s law,
Section 27–2), until they
would have reached the 2.7-K background radiation we observe today.
Looking Back toward the Big Bang—Lookback Time
Figure 33–27 shows our Earth point of view, looking out in all directions back
toward the Big Bang and the brief (380,000-year-long) period when ra
