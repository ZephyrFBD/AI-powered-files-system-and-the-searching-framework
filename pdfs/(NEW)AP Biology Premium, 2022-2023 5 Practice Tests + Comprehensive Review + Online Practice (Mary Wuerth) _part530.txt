fspring is lower than that of organisms living in a more stable environment. By producing more offspring,
organisms increase the probability of at least one of their offspring passing on their alleles to the next generation of
organisms. Organisms that live in more stable environments with greater access to energy-containing compounds
will produce fewer offspring at a time. Since the likelihood of survival of their offspring is higher, not as many
offspring need to be produced to ensure their alleles are passed on to the next generation. Reproductive strategies
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 23.
