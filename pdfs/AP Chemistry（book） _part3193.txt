values for a large variety of voltaic cells.

Give It Some Thought
For the half-reaction Cl21g2 + 2 e- ¡ 2 Cl-1aq2, what are the standard conditions 
for the reactant and product?
Because electrical potential measures potential energy per electrical charge, stan-
dard reduction potentials are intensive properties. 
 (Section 1.3) In other words, if 
we increase the amount of substances in a redox reaction, we inc
