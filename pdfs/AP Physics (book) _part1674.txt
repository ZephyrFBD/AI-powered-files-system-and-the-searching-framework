Solar energy:
Active solar heating: rooftop solar
panels absorb the Sun’s rays, which
heat water in tubes for space
heating and hot water supply.
Passive solar heating: architectural
devices—windows along southern
exposure, sunshade over windows
to keep Sun’s rays out in summer.
Solar cells (photovoltaic cells):
convert sunlight directly into
electricity without use of heat
engine.
We know how to build them; for
now relatively inexpensive.
Normally
almost no air 
pollution; less 
contribution to 
global warming;
relatively inexpensive.
Relatively “clean”; vast fuel
supply (hydrogen in water
molecules in oceans); less
contribution to global warming.
No heat engine needed; no air,
water, or thermal pollution;
relatively inexpensive; high
efficiency; dams can control
flooding.
No heat engine needed; little air
pollution; good efficiency;
relatively inexpensive and “clean.”
