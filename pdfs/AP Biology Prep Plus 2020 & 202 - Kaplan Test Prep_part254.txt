 transport systems is the colonization of a terrestrial environment.
Plants also harnessed a physical disadvantage, water loss, and turned it
into a benefit, with the force of water loss powering water transport
through the xylem.
Xylem
The vascular tissue of the xylem contains a continuous column of water
from the roots to the leaves, extending into the veins of the leaves. The
leaves regulate the amount of water that is lost through transpiration.
Water is transported from the roots to the shoots. In other words, from
roots to stems, water is transported through two diï¬€erent mechanisms:
root pressure and cohesion-tension.
Osmotic pressure in the roots tends to build up due to water absorption.
This pressure pushes water up from the roots into the stem of the plant.
Root pressure functions best in extremely humid conditions when there is
abundant water in the ground or at night. The drops of water, or dew,
that appear on blades of grass or other small plants in the morning result
from
