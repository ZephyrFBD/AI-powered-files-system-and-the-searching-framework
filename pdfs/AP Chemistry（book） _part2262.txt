 reaction depends on the rate of step 1, and the rate law of the overall 
reaction equals the rate law of step 1. Step 1 is a bimolecular process that has the rate law
 
Rate = k13NO242 
Thus, the rate law predicted by this mechanism agrees with the one observed experimen-
tally. The reactant CO is absent from the rate law because it reacts in a step that follows 
the rate-determining step.
A scientist would not, at this point, say that we have “proved” that this mechanism 
is correct. All we can say is that the rate law predicted by the mechanism is consistent with 
experiment. We can often envision a different sequence of steps that leads to the same rate 
law. If, however, the predicted rate law of the proposed mechanism disagrees with exper-
iment, we know for certain that the mechanism cannot be correct.
*Note the rate constants k1 and k2 written above the reaction arrows. The subscript on each rate 
constant identifies the elementary step involved. Thus, k1 is the rate constant f
