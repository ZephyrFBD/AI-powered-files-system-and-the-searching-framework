to easily 
read the capillary tube, it must be out of the water. Make sure the top end of the capillary 
tube is open (not sealed). 
The respirometers must be airtight, and they are sensitive to environmental changes, 
including bumping the lab table. Once the respirometers have reached equilibrium, they 
should not be touched or moved, nor should anything else be added to or taken out of 
the water baths (including your hands!). 
Collecting Data 
Step 1 Prepare a table like Table 1 to record your data and observations in your 
lab notebook. You will need to record data for both the experimental and control 
microrespirometers.
