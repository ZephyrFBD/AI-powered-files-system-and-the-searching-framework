ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON TRAITS
Changes in genotypes can result in changes in phenotype, but environmental factors also influence many traits, both
directly and indirectly. In addition, an organism’s adaptation to the local environment reflects a flexible response of
its genome. For example, gene expression and protein function can be affected by temperature. Phenotypic
plasticity occurs if two individuals with the same genotype have different phenotypes because they are in different
environments.
Here are some examples of how the environment can influence traits both directly and indirectly:
AN OVERVIEW OF MEIOSIS
Meiosis is the production of gametes. Since sexually reproducing organisms need only haploid cells for
reproduction, meiosis is limited to sex cells in special sex organs called gonads. In males, the gonads are the testes,
while in females they are the ovaries. The special cells in these organs—also known as germ cells—produce
haploid cells (n), whic
