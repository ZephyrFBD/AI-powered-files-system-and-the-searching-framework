IST-3.B
Explain how cells 
communicate with one 
another over short and 
long distances.
IST-3.B.1
Cells communicate over short distances by 
using local regulators that target cells in the 
vicinity of the signal-emitting cell 
—
a. 
Signals released by one cell type can travel 
long distances to target cells of another 
cell type.
