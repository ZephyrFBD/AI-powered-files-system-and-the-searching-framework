s to have three
hundred 3-V lithium ion cells connected such that the total
voltage across all of the cells is 300 V. Describe a possible
connection configuration (using series and parallel con-
nections) that would meet these battery specifications.
19–5 Capacitors in Series and Parallel
38. (I) (a) Six 
capacitors are connected in parallel.
What is the equivalent capacitance? (b) What is their equiva-
lent capacitance if connected in series?
39. (I) A 
and a 
capacitor are connected in series,
and this combination is connected in parallel with a 
capacitor (see Fig. 19–63). What is the net capacitance?
40. (II) If 21.0 V is applied across
the whole network of Fig. 19–63,
calculate (a) the voltage across
each capacitor and (b) the charge
on each capacitor.

41. (II) The capacitance of a portion of a circuit is to be reduced
from 2900 pF to 1200 pF. What capacitance can be added to
the circuit to produce this effect without removing existing
