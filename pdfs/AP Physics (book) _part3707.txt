lence, which states that
no experiment can be performed that could distinguish between a uniform
gravitational field and an equivalent uniform acceleration.
If observers sensed that they were accelerating (as in a vehicle speeding around
a sharp curve), they could not prove by any experiment that in fact they weren’t
simply experiencing the pull of a gravitational field. Conversely, we might think
we are being pulled by gravity when in fact we are undergoing an acceleration
having nothing to do with gravity.
As a thought experiment, consider a person in a freely falling elevator near
the Earth’s surface. If our observer held out a book and let go of it, what would
happen? Gravity would pull it downward toward the Earth, but at the same rate
at which the person and elevator were falling. So the book would
hover right next to the person’s hand (Fig. 33–12). The effect is exactly the same
as if this reference frame was at rest and no forces were acting. On the other
hand, if the elevator
