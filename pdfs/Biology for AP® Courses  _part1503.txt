 for one base only at a time which can be time consuming.
c.
Sanger’s method is highly inexpensive and less accurate. However, it is not readily adaptable to commercial
kits.
d.
Sanger’s method is less time consuming and highly accurate. However, it is more expensive than other
methods available for sequencing.
The method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. The sequencing method is based on the use of chain
terminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The dideoxynucleotides, or ddNTPSs, differ from the deoxynucleotides by
the lack of a free 3' OH group on the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain
is not extended any further because the free 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a
predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different
sizes.
