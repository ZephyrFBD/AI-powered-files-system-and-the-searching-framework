 explosion known as a supernova (plural
supernovae). The tremendous energy release (Fig. 33â€“9) could form virtually all
elements of the Periodic Table (see below) and blow away the entire outer
envelope of the star, spreading its contents into interstellar space. The presence
of heavy elements on Earth and in our solar system suggests that our solar system
formed from the debris of many such supernova explosions.
The elements heavier than Ni are thought to form mainly by neutron capture
in these exploding supernovae (rather than by fusion, as for elements up to Ni).
Large numbers of free neutrons, resulting from nuclear reactions, are present
inside those highly evolved stars and they can readily combine with, say, a 
nucleus to form (if three are captured) 
which decays to 
The

capture neutrons, also becoming neutron rich and decaying by 
to the next
higher Z element, and so on to the highest Z elements.
The final state of a neutron star depends on its mass. If the final mass is
