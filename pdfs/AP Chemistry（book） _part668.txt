CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
 
 (a) Which of these reactions are redox reactions? (b) In each 
redox reaction identify the element undergoing oxidation 
and the element undergoing reduction. (c) How many grams 
of ammonia must you start with to make 1000.0 L of a 0.150 M 
aqueous solution of nitric acid? Assume all the reactions give 
100% yield.
 4.97 Consider the following reagents: zinc, copper, mercury (den-
sity 13.6 g/mL), silver nitrate solution, nitric acid solution. 
(a) Given a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask and a balloon, can you 
combine two or more of the foregoing reagents to initiate a 
chemical reaction that will inflate the balloon? Write a bal-
anced chemical equation to represent this process. What 
is the identity of the substance that inflates the balloon? 
 
(b) What is the theoretical yield of the substance that fills 
the balloon? (c)
