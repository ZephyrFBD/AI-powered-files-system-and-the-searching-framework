e-catalyzed process in more detail. If included, 
a nonlab mini-research project requires additional time for students to present their 
results and conclusions to their peers, perhaps in the form of a mini-poster session or 
traditional laboratory report. 
Before students proceed to designing and conducting their own nonlab 
investigations/research projects based on the following suggested topics, it is helpful to 
steer them in the right direction to gather some preinvestigation information. 
Topic A: Ask students to investigate enzymes that appear to be conserved across all 
living domains (bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals). Studentsâ€™ research should raise 
questions, including How similar are the enzymes in function, structure, and usage? For 
example, a specific dehydrogenase has been found in E. coli, corn, horse liver, and sheep. 
Does this mean that the enzyme evolved numerous times in numerous organisms or just 
once early in the history of life? Does the enzyme function t
