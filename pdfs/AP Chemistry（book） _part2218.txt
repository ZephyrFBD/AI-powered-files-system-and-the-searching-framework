ine. The slope of 
this line is -5.1 * 10-5 s-1. (You should verify this for yourself, remembering that your 
result may vary slightly from ours because of inaccuracies associated with reading the 
graph.) Because the slope of the line equals -k, the rate constant for this reaction equals 
5.1 * 10-5 s-1.
Second-Order Reactions
A second-order reaction is one for which the rate depends either on a reactant concen-
tration raised to the second power or on the concentrations of two reactants each raised 
to the first power. For simplicity, let’s consider reactions of the type A ¡ products or 
A + B ¡ products that are second order in just one reactant, A:
 
Rate = - 
∆3A4
∆t
= k3A42 
With the use of calculus, this differential rate law can be used to derive the integrated rate 
law for second-order reactions:

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
This equation, like Equation 14.13, has four variables, k, t, 3A40, and 3A4t, and any one of 
these can be calculat
