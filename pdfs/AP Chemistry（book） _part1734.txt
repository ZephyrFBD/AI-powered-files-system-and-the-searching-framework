the following substances and (b) select the substance 
with the highest boiling point: CH3CH3, CH3OH, and 
CH3CH2OH.
Viscosity
Some liquids, such as molasses and motor oil, flow very slowly; others, such as water 
and gasoline, flow easily. The resistance of a liquid to flow is called viscosity. The 
greater a liquid’s viscosity, the more slowly it flows. Viscosity can be measured by timing 
how long it takes a certain amount of the liquid to flow through a thin vertical tube 
(Figure 11.16). Viscosity can also be determined by measuring the rate at which steel balls 
fall through the liquid. The balls fall more slowly as the viscosity increases. Th
