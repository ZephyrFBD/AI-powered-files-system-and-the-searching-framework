 activity.
Blood glucose (sugar) levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods
of fasting. Insulin and glucagon are two primary hormones responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of blood glucose
levels. When the blood glucose level is high, beta cells of the pancreas secrete insulin, enhancing the rate of glucose uptake
from the blood and utilization by target cells, such as the use of glucose for ATP production. When the blood glucose level
is low, alpha cells of the pancreas secrete glucagon, stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose.
A second example is hormonal regulation of the male and female reproductive systems (see the Animal Reproduction and
Development chapter). Regulation requires the action of several hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the adrenal
cortex, and the gonads. During puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropins hormone
(GnRH), which stimulates the production and re
