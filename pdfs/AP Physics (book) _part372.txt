epresent each force acting on it. Include every force acting on that
object. Do not show forces that the chosen object exerts on other objects. To help
you identify each and every force that is exerted on your chosen object, ask yourself
what other objects could exert a force on it. If your problem involves more than one
object, a separate free-body diagram is needed for each object. For now, the likely
forces that could be acting are gravity and contact forces (one object pushing or
pulling another, normal force, friction). Later we will consider other types of force
such as buoyancy, fluid pressure, and electric and magnetic forces.
