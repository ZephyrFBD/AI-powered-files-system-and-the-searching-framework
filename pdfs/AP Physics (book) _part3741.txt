e tiny inhomogeneities in density and tempera-
ture were detected first by the COBE satellite experiment in 1992, led by George
Smoot and John Mather (Fig. 33–25).
This discovery of the anisotropy of the CMB ranks with the discovery of the CMB
itself in the history of cosmology. The blackbody fit and the anisotropy were the cul-
mination of decades of research by pioneers such as Richard Muller, Paul Richards,
and David Wilkinson. Subsequent experiments gave us greater detail in 2003, 2006,
and 2012 with the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) results,
Fig.33–26, and even more recently with the European Planck satellite results in 2013.
The CMB provides strong evidence in support of the Big Bang, and gives us
information about conditions in the very early universe. In fact, in the late 1940s,
George Gamow and his collaborators calculated that a Big Bang origin of the
universe should have generated just such a microwave background radiation.
To understand why, let us look at wha
