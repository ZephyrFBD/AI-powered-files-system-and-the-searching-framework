es the same as the coefficients in the 
balanced equation, this is not necessarily the case, as Equations 14.9 and 14.11 show.
For any reaction, the rate law must be determined experimentally.
In most rate laws, reaction orders are 0, 1, or 2. However, we also occasionally encounter 
rate laws in which the reaction order is fractional (as is the case with Equation 14.11) or 
even negative.
Give It Some Thought
The experimentally determined rate law for the reaction 
2 NO1g2 + 2 H21g2 ยก N21g2 + 2  H2O1g2 
is Rate = k3NO423H24.
If the concentration of H2 is doubled, will the reaction rate quadruple, double, or 
remain the same?
Consider a reaction A + B ยก C for which 
rate = k3A43B42. Each of the following boxes 
represents a reaction mixture in which A is 
shown as red spheres and B as purple ones. 
Rank these mixtures in order of increasing rate 
of reaction.
