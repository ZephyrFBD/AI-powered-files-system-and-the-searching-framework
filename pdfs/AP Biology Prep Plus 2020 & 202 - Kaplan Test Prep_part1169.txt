and
biology are such that they can no longer interbreed and produce viable
oﬀspring. (C) precisely matches this definition of species and is thus
correct. (A), (B), and (D) can all cause speciation to occur but aren’t
suﬀicient to prove individuals are indeed diﬀerent species.
54. A
Based on the trends described in the question and in Table 1, it suggests
that the average anole from species D is increasing its UV reflectance.
According to the theory of natural selection, this must be because
increased UV reflectance provides a reproductive advantage over low UV
reflectance. As a result, the population must be under directional
selection, which matches (A). (B) is wrong because diﬀerent species are
unable to produce viable oﬀspring, according to Darwin’s theory of
evolution. (C) is incorrect because if the population were under disruptive
selection then there would be a shiȇ to both a high and a low reflectance
phenotype. Similarly, (D) is incorrect because a population experiencing
