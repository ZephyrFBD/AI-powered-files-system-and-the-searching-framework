59. Scientists are studying the use of inhibitors against non-kinase enzymes
in an eﬀort to slow tumor growth. One class of enzymes of particular
clinical interest includes the acetyltransferases, which are responsible for
adding an acetyl group, a type of post-translational modification, onto
other proteins.
From which of the following experiments could scientists determine
whether an inhibitor to acetyltransferase is competitive or
noncompetitive?
Adding increasing amounts of substrate to the enzyme to determine
Vmax in the absence and presence of the inhibitor.
(A)
Changing the temperature in 10°C increments and measuring the
enzymatic rate.
(B)
Varying the amount of enzyme when the inhibitor is present and
measuring the Vmax.
(C)
Determining where the inhibitor binds on the substrate.
