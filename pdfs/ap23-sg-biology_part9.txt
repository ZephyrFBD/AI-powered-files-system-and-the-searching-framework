The leaves of a particular plant species are typically green, but scientists notice a plant in
which the leaves have white stripes. They determine that the stripes result from a
mutation in mitochondrial DNA that interferes with the development of chloroplasts. The
scientists crossed plants using pollen from the plant with white-striped leaves and ovules
from a plant with green leaves. Predict the phenotype(s) of the leaves of offspring
produced from this cross.
•
The leaves will be (all) green/not have white stripes.
 1 point 
Provide reasoning to justify your prediction. 
•
(All offspring will have the same leaf phenotype as the ovule-producing plant
because) mitochondria are maternally inherited/transferred by the ovule.
1 point 
Explain why plants with the same genotype are able to differ in the structure and/or 
number of certain organelles in response to changes in atmospheric levels of 
2
CO . 
•
(Plants have different phenotypes because) changes in CO2 levels/the enviro
