17–5 Electric Potential Due to 
Point Charges
The electric potential at a distance r from a single point charge Q can be derived
from the expression for its electric field (Eq. 16–4,
) using calculus.
The potential in this case is usually taken to be zero at infinity (
, which
means extremely, indefinitely, far away); this is also where the electric field
is zero. The result is
(17;5)
where
We can think of V here
as representing the absolute potential at a distance r from the charge Q, where
at
or we can think of V as the potential difference between r and
infinity.
