thus passing traits to future generations. A 
diverse gene pool is vital for the survival of species because environmental 
conditions change. The process of evolution explains the diversity and unity 
of life, but an explanation about the origin of life is less clear.
In addition to the process of natural selection, naturally occurring 
catastrophic and human-induced events as well as random environmental 
changes can result in alteration in the gene pools of populations. 
Scientific evidence supports that speciation and extinction have occurred 
throughout Earth’s history and that life continues to evolve within a 
changing environment, thus explaining the diversity of life.

BIG IDEA 2: ENERGETICS (ENE)
Biological systems use energy and molecular building blocks to grow, 
reproduce, and maintain dynamic homeostasis. Cells and organisms
