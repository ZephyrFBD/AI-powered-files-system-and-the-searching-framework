he spacecraft. In this
frame of reference, the spaceship is at rest; Earth and Neptune move† with speed v.
The time between departure of Earth and arrival of Neptune, as observed from the
spacecraft, is the “proper time”
(page 753), because these two events occur 
at the same point in space (i.e., at the spacecraft). Therefore the time interval is
less for the spacecraft observers than for the Earth observers. That is, because of
time dilation (Eq. 26–1a), the time for the trip as viewed by the spacecraft is
[spacecraft observer]
Because the spacecraft observers measure the same speed but less time between
these two events, they also measure the distance as less. If we let be the distance
between the planets as viewed by the spacecraft observers, then 
which we can rewrite as
Thus
we have the important result that
(26–3a)
or, using (Eq. 26–2),
(26–3b)
This is a general result of the special theory of relativity and applies to lengths of
objects as well as to distance between objects. T
