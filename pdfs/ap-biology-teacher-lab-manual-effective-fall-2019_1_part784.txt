k that both tubes (substrate and enzyme) have equal amounts 
of liquid by holding the tubes next to each other. The student must always use a clean 
measuring apparatus for each solution. Make sure that students label each measuring 
device for the specific solution used and then use it for only that material (e.g., distilled 
water, guaiacol, hydrogen peroxide, and enzyme). 
For Procedure 2, students must replace the 6.0 mL of distilled water in their original 
enzyme tube with 6.0 mL of a specific pH buffer. Students then compare reaction rates.

■ THE INVESTIGATIONS  
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
Have students review the importance of the structure of an organic molecule to its 
overall function. Make sure that students review the laboratory equipment they are to 
use and understand units of measure, especially since a 1.0 mL pipette i
