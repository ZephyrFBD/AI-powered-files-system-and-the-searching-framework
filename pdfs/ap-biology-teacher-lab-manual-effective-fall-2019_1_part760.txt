ou 
must then separate the vials and cap each separately. Do not try to isolate every fly from 
the original culture. It is difficult to separate flies, and you may lose a fly or two in the 
process. 
Step 3 After your lab group has the flies in a vial without food, observe the position of the 
flies in your upright vial. 
Step 4 Invert the vial, and observe the position of the flies after 15 seconds and after 30 
seconds.

Step 5 What was the flies’ response? Did most/all of the flies move in the same general 
direction? If so, this might be an “orientation movement,” which is a movement that is 
in response to some stimulus. Based on how you manipulated the vial, to what stimulus 
might the flies be responding? Do you think that they were responding to some chemical 
change in the vial? Did your observations generate other questions? Explain your 
answers.  
■ Procedure 
Animals move in response to many different stimuli. A chemotaxis is a mo
