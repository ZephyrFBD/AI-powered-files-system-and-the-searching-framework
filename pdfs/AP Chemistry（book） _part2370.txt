▲ Figure 15.3 Achieving chemical equilibrium in the N2O41g2 ¡  2 NO21g2 reaction. Equilibrium 
occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.
equilibrium mixture remains constant with time does not mean that N2O4 and NO2 
stop reacting. On the contrary, the equilibrium is dynamic—which means some N2O4 is 
always converting to NO2 and some NO2 is always converting to N2O4. At equilibrium, 
however, the two processes occur at the same rate, as shown in Figure 15.3(b).
We learn several important lessons about equilibrium from this example:
t At equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products no longer change 
 
with time.
t For equilibrium to o
