If we have come this far then we have fully isolated, characterized,
and genetically sequenced an exogenous virus particle. However, we
still have to show it is causally related to a disease. This is carried
out by exposing a group of healthy subjects (animals are usually
used) to this isolated, puriﬁed virus in the manner in which the
disease is thought to be transmiĴed. If the animals get sick with the
same disease, as conﬁrmed by clinical and autopsy ﬁndings, one has
