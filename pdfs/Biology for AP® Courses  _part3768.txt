to
easily reach all the parts of the body from the
heart.
b.
Because the elongated heart allows more blood
to reach all the parts of the body, it allows for
more nutrient exchange.
c.
Because an elongated heart allows blood to
easily return to the heart from a few points
within the body cavity.
d.
Because an elongated heart allows blood to
easily return to the heart from most points within
the body cavity.
36. Insects have open circulatory systems in which blood,
or hemolymph, circulates through the body cavity rather
than through closed blood vessels. Birds, like other
vertebrates, have closed circulatory systems in which
blood remains within arteries, veins, and capillaries as it
circulates. How has this difference most likely influenced
the evolution of birds and insects?
a.
The open circulatory system of birds warms
their entire body quicker, allowing them to live
in colder climates more successfully than
insects.
b.
The closed circulatory system allows blood flow
to increase to th
