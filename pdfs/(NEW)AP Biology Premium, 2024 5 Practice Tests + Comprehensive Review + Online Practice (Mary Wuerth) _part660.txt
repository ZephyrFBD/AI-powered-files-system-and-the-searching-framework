entrations would have lower, not higher, water potentials. Aqueous solutions with different solute
concentrations would have different water potentials, so choice (C) is incorrect. While sides A and B do contain
the same solutes, they have different concentrations of each solute, so their water potentials are different,
making choice (D) incorrect.
10. (C) As stated in the question, glucose can cross the membrane. Since side B has an initially higher
concentration of glucose than side A, glucose will move down its concentration gradient from side B to side A,
and the concentration of glucose on side A will increase. Choice (A) is incorrect because the concentration of
glucose on side B will decrease, not increase, as glucose moves down its concentration gradient. Choices (B)
and (D) are incorrect because albumin cannot cross the membrane according to the question.
11. (A) Side A has a lower solute concentration and a higher water potential than side B, so water will move from
the highe
