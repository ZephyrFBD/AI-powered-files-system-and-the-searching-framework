ve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal. Conversely, the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is the
additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation. The residual volume (RV) is the amount of air that is
left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled. The lungs are never completely empty: There is always some air left in the
lungs after a maximal exhalation. If this residual volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely, the lung tissues
would stick together and the energy necessary to re-inflate the lung could be too great to overcome. Therefore, there is
always some air remaining in the lungs. Residual volume is also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory
gases (O2 and CO2). The residual volume is the only lung volume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible
to completely empty the lung of air. This volume can only be calculated rather than measured.
Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes. The vi
