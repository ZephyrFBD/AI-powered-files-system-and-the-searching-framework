ermine the equilibrium concentrations of NO2 and N2O4, which are shown in 
Table 15.1.
To evaluate Kc, we insert the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium- 
constant expression. For example, using Experiment 1 data, 3NO24 = 0.0172 M and 
3N2O44 = 0.00140 M, we find
 
Kc =
3NO242
3N2O44 =
30.017242
0.00140
= 0.211

Proceeding in the same way, the values of Kc for the other samples are cal-
culated. Note from Table 15.1 that the value for Kc is constant (within the limits 
of experimental error), even though the initial concentrations vary, as do the 
final concentrations. Furthermore, Experiment 4 shows that equilibrium can be 
achieved beginning with N2O4 rather than with NO2. That is, equilibrium can 
be approached from either direction. Figure 15.6 shows how Experiments 3 and 
4 result in the same equilibrium mixture even though the two experiments start 
with very different NO2 concentrati
