on levels as
estimated by pelt harvest records. The snowshoe hare is an herbivore
and is the predominant food source for the lynx.
The change in phenotypic frequency shown can only occur if
the trait is ubiquitous in the population.
(A)
The change in phenotypic frequency shown can only occur if
there is existing genetic variation for the trait in the
population.
(B)
The trait under selection must be inherited in a Mendelian
manner in order for changes in phenotypic frequency to
occur.
(C)
The plot lines of figure A must have a diï¬€erent shape in order
for the changes in phenotypic frequency to occur.

8. One hypothesis to explain the cycling is that the predator
population size drives the population size of the prey. When the
predator population increases beyond a certain point, the lynx eat
more snowshoe hares than the snowshoe hares can replace
through reproduction. The snowshoe hare population crashes as
a result of predation by the overabundant lynx. The lower
availability of sno
