cans dying of ‘Covid’ while having other serious
medical conditions – on average two to three (some ﬁve or six) other
potential causes of death. In terms of death from an unproven ‘virus’
I say it is 100 percent. The other one percent in Italy and six percent
in the US would presumably have died from ‘Covid’s’ ﬂu-like
symptoms with a range of other possible causes in conjunction with
a test not testing for the ‘virus’. Fox News reported that even more
startling ﬁgures had emerged in one US county in which 410 of 422
deaths aĴributed to ‘Covid-19’ had other potentially deadly health
conditions. The Italian National Health Institute said later that the
average age of people dying with a ‘Covid-19’ diagnosis in Italy was
about 81. Ninety percent were over 70 with ten percent over 90. In
terms of other reasons to die some 80 percent had two or more
chronic diseases with half having three or more including
cardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer.
