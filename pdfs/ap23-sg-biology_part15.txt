oofed animals, including cattle and sheep, that have a unique four-chambered stomach 
specialized to digest tough, fiber-filled grasses. Researchers studying ruminants are investigating the 
morphological and molecular characteristics of different ruminant families in order to determine the 
evolutionary relationships among the families. Cladograms of several ruminant families were constructed 
based on morphological data (Figure 1A) and molecular data (Figure 1B). Table 1 shows a sample of the 
morphological characteristics present in each family used to construct the cladogram in Figure 1A.
