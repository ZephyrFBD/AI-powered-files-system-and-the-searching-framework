l could be produced from biomass and that benzene 
is replaced by less toxic toluene. The hydrogen formed in the reaction can be recycled as 
a source of energy. This example demonstrates how finding the right catalyst is often key 
in discovering a new process.
Letâ€™s consider some other examples in which green chemistry can operate to 
improve environmental quality.
Supercritical Solvents
A major area of concern in chemical processes is the use of volatile organic compounds 
as solvents. Generally, the solvent in which a reaction is run is not consumed in the reac-
tion, and there are unavoidable releases of solvent into the atmosphere even in the most 
carefully controlled processes. Further, the solvent may be toxic or may decompose to 
some extent during the reaction, thus creating waste products.
The use of supercritical fluids represents a way to replace conventional solvents. 
Recall that a supercritical fluid is an unusual state of matter that has properties of both 
a gas and
