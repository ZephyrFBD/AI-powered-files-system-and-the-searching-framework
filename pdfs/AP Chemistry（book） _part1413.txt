Which of the p orbitals do you think contributes the most in 
the mixing that leads to the right-most  sp3 hybrid orbital in the 
second row of the figure?

Does it matter which of the two sp3 hybrid orbitals are used to 
hold the two nonbonding electron pairs?
Hypervalent Molecules
So far our discussion of hybridization has extended only to period 2 elements, spe-
cifically carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The elements of period 3 and beyond intro-
duce a new consideration because in many of their compounds these elements are 
hypervalent— 
they have more than an octet of electrons around the central atom. 
 (Section 8.7) We saw in Section 9.2 that the VSEPR model works well to predict 
the geometries of hypervalent molecules such as PCl5, SF6,
