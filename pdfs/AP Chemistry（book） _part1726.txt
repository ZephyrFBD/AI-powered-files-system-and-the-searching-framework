forming at the top of a lake would sink 
to the bottom, and the lake could freeze solid. Most aquatic life could not survive under 
these conditions.
Give It Some Thought
What major type of attractive interaction must be overcome for water to evaporate?
Give It Some Thought
In which mixture do you expect to find ion–dipole forces between solute and 
solvent to exist: CH3OH in water or Ca1NO322 in water?

Why does the O side of H2O point 
toward the Na+ ion?
Positive ends of polar molecules are 
oriented toward negatively charged 
anion.
Negative ends of polar molecules are 
oriented toward positively charged 
cation.

Ion–Dipole Forces
An ion–dipole force exists between an ion and a polar molecule (Figure 11.13). Cat-
ions are attracted to the negative end of a dipole, and anions are attracted to the pos-
itive end. The magnitude of the attraction increases as either the ionic charge or the 
magnit
