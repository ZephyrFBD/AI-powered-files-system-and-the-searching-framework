gion of lower concentration to a region of
higher concentration. A transport protein can help usher the substance across the plasma membrane, but it’s going to
need energy to accomplish this. This time it’s like riding a bicycle uphill. Compared with riding downhill, riding
uphill takes a lot more work. Movement against the natural flow is called active transport.
But where does the protein get this energy? Some proteins in the plasma membrane are powered by ATP. The best
example of active transport is a special protein called the sodium-potassium pump. It ushers out three sodium ions
(Na+) and brings in two potassium ions (K+) across the cell membrane. This pump depends on ATP to get ions
across that would otherwise remain in regions of higher concentration. Primary active transport occurs when ATP is
directly utilized to transport something. Secondary active transport occurs when something is actively transported
using the energy captured from the movement of another substance flowin
