3.4 ∣ Avogadro’s Number and the Mole
Even the smallest samples we deal with in the laboratory contain enormous numbers 
of atoms, ions, or molecules. For example, a teaspoon of water (about 5 mL) contains 
2 * 1023 water molecules, a number so large it almost defies comprehension. Chem-
ists therefore have devised a counting unit for describing large numbers of atoms or 
molecules.
In everyday life we use such familiar counting units as dozen (12 objects) and gross 
(144 objects). In chemistry the counting unit for numbers of atoms, ions, or molecules 
in a laboratory-size sample is the mole, abbreviated mol. One mole is the amount of 
matter that contains as many objects (atoms, molecules, or whatever other objects we 
are considering) as the number of atoms in exactly 12 g of isotopically pure 12C. From 
experiments, scientists have determine
