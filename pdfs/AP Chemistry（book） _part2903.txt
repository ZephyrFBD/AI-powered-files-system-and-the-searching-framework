tential of CH4 is about 21 times that of CO2. Given this 
large contribution, important reductions of the greenhouse effect 
could be achieved by reducing methane emissions or capturing the 
emissions for use as a fuel.

18.3 ∣ Earth’s Water
Water covers 72% of Earth’s surface and is essential to life. Our bodies are about 65% 
water by mass. Because of extensive hydrogen bonding, water has unusually high melt-
ing and boiling points and a high heat capacity. 
 (Section 11.2) Water’s highly polar 
character is responsible for its exceptional ability to dissolve a wide range of ionic and 
polar-covalent substances. Many reactions occur in water, including reactions in which 
H2O itself is a react
