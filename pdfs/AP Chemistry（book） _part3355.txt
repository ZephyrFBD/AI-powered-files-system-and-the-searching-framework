(d) Electron capture followed by positron emission
(e) More than one of the above is consistent with the observed 
transformation.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write a balanced nuclear equation for the reaction in which 
oxygen-15 undergoes positron emission.
21.2 ∣ Patterns of Nuclear Stability
Some nuclides, such as 12
6C and 13
6C are stable, whereas others, such as 14
6C, are unstable 
and undergo radioactive decay. Why does a small difference in the number of neutrons 
affect the stability of a nuclide? No single rule allows us to predict whether a particular 
nucleus is radioactive and, if it is, how it might decay. However, several empirical obser-
vations can help us predict the stability of a nucleus.
Neutron-to-Proton Ratio
Because like charges repel each other, it may seem surprising that a large number of pro-
tons can reside within the small volume of the nucleus. At close distances, however, a
