An ac circuit (Section 18–7) always contains some inductance, but often it is
quite small unless the circuit contains a coil of many loops or turns. A coil that
has significant self-inductance L is called an inductor. It is shown on circuit
diagrams by the symbol

passes through the coil in Fig.21–36 from left to right as shown. (a) If the current is
increasing with time, in which direction is the induced emf? (b) If the current 
is decreasing in time, what then is the direction of
