o physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in
the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the
prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland.”
A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied.
One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division
event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes.
However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a
condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.16).
