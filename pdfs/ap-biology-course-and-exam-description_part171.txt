romosomes, while eukaryotic organisms 
typically have multiple linear chromosomes.
IST-1.K.3
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can contain

double-stranded, circular DNA molecules.

IST-1.L
Describe the characteristics 
of DNA that allow it to be 
used as the hereditary 
material.
IST-1.L.1
DNA, and sometimes RNA, exhibits specific 
nucleotide base pairing that is conserved 
through evolution: adenine pairs with thymine 
or uracil (A-T or A-U) and cytosine pairs with 
guanine (C-G)—
a. Purines (G and A) have a double 
ring structure.
b. Pyrimidines (C, T, and U) have a single 
ring structure.
