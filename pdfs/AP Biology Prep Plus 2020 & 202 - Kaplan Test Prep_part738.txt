m. There were five recognized kingdoms (Monera,
Protoctista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia). Now all of life is first
divided into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.
A taxon is a grouping of related organisms, such as a species, genus,
phylum, or kingdom. Phylogenetic trees show hypotheses of

evolutionary relationships among various taxa, indicating common lines
of descent from shared ancestors. The example on the following page
shows evolutionary relationships among the phyla of kingdom Animalia,
the animals.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The names and characteristics of specific biological taxa, as well
as the relationships between these taxa, are not tested on the AP
Phylogenetic Tree of Major Animal Groups
Biology exam.
Some phylogenetic trees also give an indication of evolutionary
timescale, by keeping the distances between branchings in the tree
proportional to the amount of time between species divergences. On a
phylogenetic tre
