asic assumption is that all electrons are identical, indis-
tinguishable one from another. Similarly, all protons are identical, all neutrons are
identical, and so on. The exclusion principle does not apply to particles with integer
spin (0, 1, 2, and so on), such as the photon and meson, all of which are referred
to as bosons (after Satyendranath Bose, who derived a statistical theory for them).]
28–8 The Periodic Table of Elements
More than a century ago, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) arranged the (then)
known elements into what we now call the Periodic Table of the elements. The
atoms were arranged according to increasing mass, but also so that elements with
similar chemical properties would fall in the same column. Today’s version is shown
inside the back cover of this book. Each square contains the atomic number Z,
the symbol for the element, and the atomic mass (in atomic mass units). Finally,
the lower left corner shows the configuration of the ground state of the atom. This
