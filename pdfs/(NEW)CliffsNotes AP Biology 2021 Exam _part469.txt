ociations between fungi and plants. The fungus grows on the roots of plants,
facilitating the movement of water and minerals into the plant. In exchange, the plant provides sugars, which it
produces by photosynthesis, to the fungus.
2. Lichens are mutualistic associations between fungi and algae. The alga provides sugar from photosynthesis and
nitrogen compounds if the alga is also nitrogen-fixing. The fungus provides water and protection from the
environment. Some fungi produce pigments that shield algae from ultraviolet radiation or excess light, or toxic
substances that discourage algae consumption by grazers.
Fungi are dominantly haploid, but most form temporary diploid structures for sexual reproduction. A diploid nucleus
forms when the hyphae and haploid nuclei from two different fungal strains fuse. Meiosis of the diploid nucleus
restores the haploid condition. The daughter cells develop into haploid spores, which germinate and form haploid
hyphae. Fungi also reproduce asexually
