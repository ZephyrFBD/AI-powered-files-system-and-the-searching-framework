vides any information on the
genetic diversity of the population before the hurricane, which further rules out choice (C). Choice (D) can be
further ruled out because nothing in the question suggests that the birds never migrated back to their original
habitat.
3. (C) The founder effect occurs when a small group of individuals from a large population leaves the larger group
to colonize a new area and the small group does not possess the same allele frequencies as the larger group.
Choice (A) is incorrect because the founder effect is not caused by random evolutionary change. The rapid
reduction of a populationâ€™s size, leading to a group of survivors that is not representative of the original, larger
population, is the bottleneck effect. Thus, choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because it describes
the process of natural selection, not the founder effect.
4. (B) This scenario is an example of the founder effect. Choice (A) is incorrect because the original population
did n
