Characteristics of a 
STRONG Response
(Part a) The student is able to write a coherent paragraph 
with appropriate terminology and elaboration to explain 
how free energy is required for living systems — from cells 
to populations, communities, and ecosystems — and can 
predict consequences to these systems if free energy needs 
are not met. Based on the scenario, the student is able to 
explain through narrative or diagram with annotation 
the role
