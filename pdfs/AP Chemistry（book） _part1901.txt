12.6 ∣ Molecular Solids
Molecular solids consist of atoms or neutral molecules held together by dipole–dipole 
forces, dispersion forces, and/or hydrogen bonds. Because these intermolecular forces 
are weak, molecular solids are soft and have relatively low melting points (usually below 
200 °C). Most substances that are gases or liquids at room temperature form molecular 
solids at low temperature. Examples include Ar, H2O, and CO2.
The properties of molecular solids depend in large part on the strengths of the 
forces between molecules. Consider, for example, the properties of sucrose (table sugar, 
C12H22O11). Each sucrose molecule has eight ¬OH groups, which allow for the forma-
tion of multiple hydrogen bonds. Consequently, sucrose exists as a crystalline solid at 
room temperature, and its melting point, 184 °C, is relatively high for a molecular solid.
Molecular shape is also important because it d
