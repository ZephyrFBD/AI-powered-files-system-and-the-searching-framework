ng populations. Most scientists accept
this definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the
interaction. In this discussion, the broader definition will be used.
Commensalism
A commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither
benefits nor is harmed. Birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship (Figure 36.26). The tree is
not harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. The nests are light and produce little strain on the structural
integrity of the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so
they are unaffected. The bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. If the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young
would be vulnerable to predators. Another example of a commensal relationship is the clown fish and the sea anemone.
