 oxygen molecules,
forming the molecule oxyhemoglobin. To function in the transport of
oxygen, hemoglobin must be able to bind with oxygen in the lungs and
unload it at the body cells. The more tightly the hemoglobin binds to
oxygen in the lungs, the more difficult it is to unload the cells.
Hemoglobin is an allosteric molecule and exhibits cooperativity. This
means that once it binds to one oxygen molecule, hemoglobin undergoes a
shape change and binds more easily to the remaining three oxygen
molecules. In addition, hemoglobinâ€™s conformation is sensitive to pH. A
drop in pH lowers the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (known as the
Bohr shift). Because CO2 dissolves in water to form carbonic acid,
actively respiring tissue, which releases large quantities of CO2, will lower
the pH of its surroundings and induce hemoglobin to release its oxygen at
the cells where needed.
