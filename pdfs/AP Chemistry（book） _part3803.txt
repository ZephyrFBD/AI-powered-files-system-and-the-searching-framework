tion 13.3) Organic molecules that are soluble in polar solvents are 
those that have polar groups on the molecule surface, such as glucose and ascorbic acid 
(Figure 24.2). Organic molecules that have a long, nonpolar part bonded to a polar, ionic 
part, such as the stearate ion shown in Figure 24.2, function as surfactants and are used in 
soaps and detergents. 
 (Section 13.6) The nonpolar part of the molecule extends into 
a nonpolar medium such as grease or oil, and the polar part extends into a polar medium 
such as water.
Many organic substances contain acidic or basic groups. The most important acidic 
organic substances are the carboxylic acids, which bear the functional group ¬COOH. 
 
 (Sections 4.3 and 16.10) The most important basic organic substances are amines, 
which bear the ¬NH2, ¬NHR, or ¬NR2 groups, where R is an organic group made up 
of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
