The decay of unstable radioisotopes is exponential with a
half-life of T1/2, which for 87Rb is 4.88 × 1010 years:
N87Rb = N87Rb, 0e
−0.693t/ T1 /

This can be used to replace the initial number of 87Rb
atoms, which cannot be measured, with the present-day
value:
N87sr
N86sr
=
N87sr, 0
N86sr
+ (e
−0.693t/ T1 /

N87Rb
N86sr
When the measurements of the numbers of 87Rb and 87Sr
were made (Moorbath et al., Nature, 1972), measurements
of a second stable isotope of strontium, 86Sr, were also
made. The ratio of the initial number of 87Sr and 86Sr
atoms is the same as today, since the isotopes are both
stable. The value of this ratio is 0.71.
This is a linear equation in the form y = ax + b, where a is
the term in parenthesis containing the half-life of 87Rb. If
Y = N87Sr/ N86Sr is graphed versus N87Rb/ N86Sr,
the slope can be used to determine the time, t, that has
