E. Researchers are investigating the interactions among
multiple signaling pathways, a phenomenon referred to as
“crosstalk.” The same second messengers, NO and Ca2+,
are used in many different signaling pathways. Construct
an explanation by analogy to other phenomena in which
combining a small set of events (for example, 0 and 1 in a
computer, the musical scale, or the R, G, and B
components of a color) can lead to a vast assortment of
outcomes.
46. Construct a graphical representation of information
as a function of time during the transduction of a signal
along a signaling pathway.
A. Use your graph to describe trends in the amount of
information rather than the actual magnitude. In sketching
your graph, consider how the sha
