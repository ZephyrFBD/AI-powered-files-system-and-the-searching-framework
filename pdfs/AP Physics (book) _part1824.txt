; each carries the same charge Q. (a) What
is the force sphere B exerts on sphere A? (b) An identical
sphere with zero charge, sphere C, makes contact with
sphere B and is then moved very far away. What is the net
force now acting on sphere A? (c) Sphere C is brought back
and now makes contact with sphere A and is then moved
far away. What is the force on sphere A in this third case?
59. For an experiment, a colleague of yours says he smeared
toner particles uniformly over the surface of a sphere 1.0 m
in diameter and then measured an electric field of
near its surface. (a) How many toner particles
(Example 16–6) would have to be on the surface to pro-
duce these results? (b) What is the total mass of the toner
particles?
