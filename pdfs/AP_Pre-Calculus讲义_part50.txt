2.2.1 Exponential Functions 
Here, we study a new class of functions called exponential functions. For example, 
( )
2x
f x =
 
is an exponential function (with base 2). 
To study exponential functions, we must first define what we mean by the exponential 
expression ax when x is any real number.  
The exponential function with base a is defined for all real numbers x by 
( )
x
f x
a
=
 
where a > 0 and a â‰  1. 
Here are some examples of exponential functions: 
 
 
Example 1 
Let f(x) = 3x, and evaluate the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2 Graphs of Exponential Functions 
We first graph exponential functions by plotting points. 
 
69 
We will see that the graphs of such functions have an easily recognizable shape. 
 
Example 2 
Draw the graph of each function. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You can see from the figure that there are two kinds of exponential functions: 
If 0 < a <
