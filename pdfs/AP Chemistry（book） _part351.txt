Chapter Summary and Key Terms
THE ATOMIC THEORY OF MATTER; THE DISCOVERY OF ATOMIC 
STRUCTURE (SECTION 2.1 AND 2.2) Atoms are the basic building 
blocks of matter. They are the smallest units of an element that can 
combine with other elements. Atoms are composed of even smaller 
particles, called subatomic particles. Some of these subatomic parti-
cles are charged and follow the usual behavior of charged particles: 
Particles with the same charge repel one another, whereas particles 
with opposite charges are attracted to one another. 
We considered some of the important experiments that led to 
the discovery and cha
