of continuity states
that for an incompressible fluid flowing in an enclosed tube,
the product of the velocity of flow and the cross-sectional area
of the tube remains constant:

Bernoulli’s principle tells us that where the velocity of a
fluid is high, the pressure in it is low, and where the velocity is
low, the pressure is high. For steady laminar flow of an incom-
pressible and nonviscous fluid, Bernoulli’s equation, which is
based on the law of conservation of energy, is
(10;5)
for two points along the flow.
[*Viscosity refers to friction within a fluid and is essentially
a frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid as they move
past one another.]
[*Liquid surfaces hold together as if under tension 
(surface tension), allowing drops to form and objects like needles
and insects to stay on the surface.]
