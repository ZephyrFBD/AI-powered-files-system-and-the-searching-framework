ow in the xylem, which is always
unidirectional (soil to leaf to atmosphere). The pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops.
Photosynthates are directed primarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and
fruits during reproductive development. They are also directed to tubers for storage.
Translocation: Transport from Source to Sink
Photosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves. From there they are
translocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored. Mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels
called plasmodesmata. Photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (STEs) in the
vascular bundles. From the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem STEs. The sucrose is actively
transported against its concentration gradient (a process requiring ATP) into the phloem cells using the electrochemic
