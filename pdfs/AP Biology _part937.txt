(C) Carbon dioxide is a balanced and nonpolar molecule that can
readily diffuse through the membrane. Starch is too large to diffuse
through a membrane. Only protons pass through ATP synthase
channels in mitochondrial membranes.
(B) Whenever a pump is involved, the mechanism is active
transport. Glucose is always transported by either simple diffusion
or facilitated diffusion. However, neither process requires the
expenditure of energy. Choices C and D refer to passive transport.
(B) Structure B is the Golgi apparatus, which packages and secretes
proteins made by the ribosomes on the ER. The centrioles, shown as
structure A, consist of microtubules. Structure C is a lysosome.
Structure D consists of ribosomes on the ER.
(C) The patient is still producing too much cortisol even though the
pituitary is not sending a signal to the adrenal glands. ACTH, which
would normally stimulate the adrenal to release cortisol, is blocked
by the dexamethasone. If the adrenals were healthy, they shoul
