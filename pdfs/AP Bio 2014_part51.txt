14. The salinity of a small inland lake has recently 
started to increase. Researchers are planning to 
study the lake over several decades to investigate 
how freshwater organisms survive significant 
changes in their natural habitat. Which of the 
following physiological mechanisms will the 
researchers most likely observe among the 
surviving organisms in the lake? 
(A) Prokaryotic organisms will use var
