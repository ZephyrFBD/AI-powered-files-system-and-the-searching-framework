eliminate or
introduce new alleles to the gene pool, causing significant changes in the
oﬀspring. On the other hand, geographical barriers such as oceans,
mountain ranges, and deserts, restrict gene flow. Both genetic driȇ and
gene flow can be analyzed using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which is
discussed later in this chapter.
Speciation and Extinction
Over a dozen diﬀerent concepts of speciation have been promoted in
scientific literature, but the most prevalent by far is the biological
species concept (BSC). This concept states that a species is defined by a
naturally interbreeding population of organisms that produces viable,
fertile oﬀspring. In other words, two species are distinct if they can’t
breed with each other or don’t naturally breed with each other due to
certain barriers. There are two kinds of barriers to interbreeding:
prezygotic and postzygotic.
Prezygotic barriers to interbreeding include isolation of species due to
ecological, temporal, behavioral, or mechanical fac
