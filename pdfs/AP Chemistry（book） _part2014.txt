(c) formation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
[12.128]  
Although polyethylene can twist and turn in random ways, 
the most stable form is a linear one with the carbon back-
bone oriented as shown in the following figure:
(a) How many atoms of each type are there in the unit cell?
(b) Determine the coordination number and describe the 
shape of the coordination environment for the sodium 
ion.
(c) The unit cell edge length is 5.550 Å. Determine the den-
sity of Na2O.

Polymers were commercially made by the DuPont Company start-
ing in the late 1920s. At that time, some chemists still could not 
believe that polymers were molecules; they thought covalent bond-
ing would not “last” for millions of atoms, and that polymers were 
really clumps of molecules held together by weak intermolecular 
forces. Design an experiment to demonstrate that polymers really 
are large molecules and not little clumps of small molecules th
