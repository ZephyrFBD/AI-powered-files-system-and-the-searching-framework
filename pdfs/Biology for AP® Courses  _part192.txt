n the ice cubes in a glass of ice water. In lakes and ponds, ice will form on the surface of the
water creating an insulating barrier that protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. Without this layer
of insulating ice, plants and animals living in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. The
detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water. The ice crystals
that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells, irreversibly damaging
them. Cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol.

Figure 2.15 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water. The (a) lattice structure of ice makes it less
dense than the freely flowing molecules of liquid water, enabling it to (b) float on water. (credit a: modification of work
