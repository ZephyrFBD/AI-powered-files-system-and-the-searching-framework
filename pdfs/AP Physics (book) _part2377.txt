 charge flows readily toward the plates and the current I is large.
As the voltage approaches its maximum of 
(point b in Fig. 21–41b), the charge
that has accumulated on the plates tends to prevent more charge from flowing, so
the current I drops to zero at point b. Thus the current follows the blue curve in
Fig. 21–41b. Like an inductor, the voltage and current are out of phase by 90°.
But for a capacitor, the current reaches its peaks
cycle before the voltage does,
so we say that the
current leads the voltage by 90° for a capacitor.
Because the current and voltage are out of phase, the average power dissipated is
zero, just as for an inductor. Thus only a resistance will dissipate energy as thermal
energy in an ac circuit.
