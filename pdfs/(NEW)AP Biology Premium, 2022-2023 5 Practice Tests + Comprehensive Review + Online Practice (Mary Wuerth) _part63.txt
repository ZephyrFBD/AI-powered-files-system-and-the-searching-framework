11. (a) The treatment with cadmium resulted in the greatest variability in the data because it has the greatest
standard error of the mean.
(b) The control treatment was the least likely to result in chromosome breakage. Its mean percentage of cells
that showed chromosome breakage was far lower than the mean for the other two treatments.
(c) The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for lead (24.3 + 2(5.2) = 34.7) is greater than the lower limit
of the 95% confidence interval for cadmium (46.1 – 2(9.1) = 27.9), so the 95% confidence intervals for
those two treatments overlap. When the 95% confidence intervals overlap, the data are inconclusive and it is
not possible to claim that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups. The data provided
do not support the student’s claim that cadmium is more likely to result in chromosome breakage than
exposure to lead.
(d) The independent variable is the type of treatment (control, lead, or cadmium). The dependent
