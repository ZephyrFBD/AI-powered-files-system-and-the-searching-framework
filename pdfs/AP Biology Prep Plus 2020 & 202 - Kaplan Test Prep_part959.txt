more free energy than the
products; the breakdown of glucose is exergonic (energy is released).
Since ΔG is large and negative (–2880 kJ/mol), the Gibbs free energy
equation suggests the reaction increases entropy or decreases order
(ΔS > 0). Cells maintain order by coupling cellular processes that
increase entropy (and ΔG < 0) with those that decrease entropy (and
ΔG > 0). The correct answer is (D). (A) and (B) are incorrect because the
reaction is exergonic, not endergonic. (C) is incorrect because the
opposite is true: the reaction is coupled with a process that increases
order (decreases entropy).
45. D
Energetically favorable exergonic reactions (ΔG < 0) can be used to
maintain or increase order in a living system by being coupled with
endergonic reactions (ΔG > 0). The breakdown of glucose via cellular
respiration (ΔG = –2880 kJ/mol), the formation of lactate from glucose
(ΔG = –195.8 kJ/mol), and the formation of lactate from pyruvate (ΔG =
–25.1 kJ/mol) are all exergonic reacti
