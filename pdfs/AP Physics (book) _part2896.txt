Laws are the same, but 
paths may be different in different
reference frames
C A U T I O N
Length and time intervals
are absolute (pre-relativity)

Position and velocity are different in
different reference frames, but length

FIGURE 26–2 A coin is dropped by
a person in a moving car. The upper
views show the moment of the coin’s
release, the lower views are a short
time later. (a) In the reference frame
of the car, the coin falls straight down
(and the tree moves to the left).
(b) In a reference frame fixed on the
Earth, the coin has an initial velocity
(
to car’s) and follows a curved
(parabolic) path.
