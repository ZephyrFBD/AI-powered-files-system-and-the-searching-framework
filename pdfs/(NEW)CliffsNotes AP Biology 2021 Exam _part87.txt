5. Lysosomes are vesicles from a Golgi apparatus that contain hydrolytic enzymes (enzymes that break down
molecules by hydrolysis) (enzymes (enzymes that break down molecules by hydrolysis) ( 3). They break down food,
cellular debris, and foreign invaders (such as bacteria) and generally contribute to a recycling of cellular nutrients. A
low pH (acidic), favorable to the activity of the enzymes, is maintained inside the lysosome. As a result, any enzyme
that might escape from the lysosome remains inactive in the neutral pH of the cytosol.
6. Peroxisomes break down various substances, including hydrogen
 
peroxide, H2O2 (forming H2O and O2), fatty acids, and amino acids.
 
Peroxisomes are common in liver and kidney cells, where they break down toxic substances. In plant cells,
peroxisomes modify by-products
 
of photorespiration, a process by which CO2 is diverted from its use in
 
photosynthesis.
