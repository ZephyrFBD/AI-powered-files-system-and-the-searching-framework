5–3 Highway Curves:
Banked and Unbanked
An example of circular dynamics occurs when an automobile rounds a curve, say
to the left. In such a situation, you may feel that you are thrust outward toward
the right side door. But there is no mysterious centrifugal force pulling on you.
What is happening is that you tend to move in a straight line, whereas the car has
begun to follow a curved path. To make you go in the curved path, the seat 
(friction) or the door of the car (direct contact) exerts a force on you (Fig. 5–11).
The car also must have a force exerted on it toward the center of the curve if it 
is to move in that curve. On a flat road, this force is supplied by friction between
the tires and the pavement.
