 number of moles of gas. If each gas obeys the 
ideal-gas equation, we can write
P
1 = n1aRT
V b; P
2 = n2aRT
V b; P
3 = n3aRT
V b; and so forth
All of the gases in a container must occupy the same volume and will come to 
the same temperature in a relatively short period of time. Using these facts to simplify 
 
Equation 10.12, we obtain
 
P
t = 1n1 + n2 + n3 + c
2aRT
V b = ntaRT
V b 
[10.13]
That is, at constant temperature and constant volume the total pressure of a gas sample 
is determined by the total number of moles of gas present, whether that total represents 
just one gas or a mixture of gases.
We use the coefficients in the balanced equation 
to calculate the number of moles of NaN3:
11.7 mol N22a
2 mol NaN3
3 mol N2
b = 1.1 mol NaN3
Finally, using the molar mass of NaN3, we 
convert moles of NaN3 to grams:
11.1 mol NaN32a
65.0 g NaN3
1 mol NaN3
b = 72 g NaN3
