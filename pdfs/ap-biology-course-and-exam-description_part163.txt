The ability to describe, analyze, and create 
models and representations to explain and/
or illustrate biological processes and make 
predictions about them is an important 
skill for students to master. The primary 
learning goal in this unit is to create or use 
a representation/model to communicate 
biological phenomena, use the model to

solve problems.
Throughout the course, students should 
have had multiple opportunities that involv
