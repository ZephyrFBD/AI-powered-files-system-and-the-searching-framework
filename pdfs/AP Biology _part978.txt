contain structures that carry out the same function.
Organelles separate specific reactions in the cell and increase
metabolic efficiency.
Compartmentalization enables prokaryotes to reproduce more
quickly.
Many different fermentation pathways occur in different organisms
in nature. For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into
lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce
alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However,
regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an
important one. Which of the following statements best describes the
most important role of glycolysis in cellular respiration?
It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate-level
phosphorylation.
It reoxidizes
