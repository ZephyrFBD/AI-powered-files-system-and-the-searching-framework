P  
If we call the proportionality constant R, we obtain an equality:
 
V = RanT
P b 
which we can rearrange to
 
PV = nRT 
[10.5]
which is the ideal-gas equation (also called the ideal-gas law). An ideal gas is a 
hypothetical gas whose pressure, volume, and temperature relationships are described 
completely by the ideal-gas equation.
Sample Exercise 10.3 
Evaluating the Effects of Changes in P, V, n, and T  on a Gas
Suppose we have a gas confined to a cylinder with a movable piston that is sealed so there are no leaks. 
 (Sections 5.2, 5.3) 
How will each of the following changes affect (i) the pressure of the gas, (ii) the number of moles of gas in the cylinder, (iii) the 
average distance between molecules: (a) Heating the gas while maintaining a constant pressure; (b) Reducing the volume while 
maintaining a constant temperature; (c) Injecting additional gas while keeping the temperature and volume constant.
 
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to think how each change affects (1) t
