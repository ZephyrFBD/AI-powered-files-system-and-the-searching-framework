The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining
the outcome. It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature. Once we contributed to a
speciesâ€™ decline using primitive hunting technology only.
Explain the factors that may have contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, and caused it to occur over a
long period of time.
a.
Deforestation affected the ability of the woolly mammoth to find adequate habitat and food, and humans
contributed to declines in their population by hunting them.
b.
Climate change affected the ability of the woolly mammoth to find adequate habitat and food, and humans
contributed to the decline in their population by hunting them.
c.
Climate change affected the ability of the woolly mammoth to find adequate food even though they had
plenty of habitat, and humans contributed to declines in their population by hunting them.
d.
Climate change a
