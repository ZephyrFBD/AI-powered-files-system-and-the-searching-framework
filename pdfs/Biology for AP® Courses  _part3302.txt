4.1 The student is able to explain the connection between the sequence and
subcomponents of a biological polymer and its properties.
Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. Communication
between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals
called hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids (usually blood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells. At
the target cells, which are cells that have a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response.
The cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of glands of the endocrine
system include the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses
to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate
