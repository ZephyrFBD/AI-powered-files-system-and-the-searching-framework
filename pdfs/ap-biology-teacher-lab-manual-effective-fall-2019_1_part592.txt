on an inquiry-based journey as they explore key discoveries that allowed scientists 
to identify DNA as the molecule of heredity and how it is able to store, retrieve, and 
transmit information necessary for living systems. Drawing their own conclusions, 
students explore the contributions of notable scientists, including Frederick Griffith, 
Hershey and Chase, Watson and Crick, and Meselson and Stahl. The instructional 
activities are examples of how teachers can engage students by accommodating their 
different learning styles, knowledge bases, and abilities and, at the same time, provide 
depth of content and skills.
