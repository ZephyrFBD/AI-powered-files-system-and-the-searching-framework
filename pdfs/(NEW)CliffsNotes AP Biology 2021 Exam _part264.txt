ld perform a test cross if he or
she wanted to know if the tall plant in question was TT or Tt. If there were any dwarf-stemmed offspring, the farmer
could be sure that the tall parent was Tt, since you cannot obtain dwarf-stemmed offspring unless both parents
contribute the dwarf allele ( t ). In contrast, if all offspring were tall, the farmer could reasonably conclude that the
tall parent was TT. It is possible, though not likely, that the tall-stemmed parent could be Tt, and that, due to chance,
no shortstemmed offspring were produced.
A coin toss presents an analogous situation. If you toss a coin six times, the prediction is that half the time it will be
tails. However, there is a small
chance,
 
 (½ × ½ × ½ × ½ × ½ × ½), that all six tosses will be tails. As the
number of coin tosses increases, though, the probability of obtaining all tails gets smaller and smaller. For the farmer
who finds all tall offspring in the test cross, there is a small possibility that the tall parent w
