andom chance alone. For biology,
the typical p-value used is 0.05. Using the df of 1 calculated above and a p-value of 0.05, the critical value is
3.84 according to the chi-square table that follows.

4. Compare your calculated chi-square value to the critical value. The calculated chi-square value from first step
(1) is less than the critical value (3.84).
5. Based on the comparison, decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or whether you fail to reject the null
hypothesis. If the calculated chi-square value is less than or equal to the critical value, fail to reject the null
hypothesis. If the calculated chi-square value is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.
In this example, since the calculated chi-square value is less than the critical value, you would fail to reject the
null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between the observed and expected data. This does
not mean the null hypothesis is provenâ€”it just m
