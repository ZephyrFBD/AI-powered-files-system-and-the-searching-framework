o coordinate responses. The information in this
chapter allows us to apply concepts we explored previously, including structure and function relationships, homeostasis, the
movement of substances across cell membranes, cell signaling and communication, and the use of ATP.
Nervous systems in animals range from relatively simple nerve nets in jellyfish to a complex brain, spinal cord, and
peripheral nervous in humans. (For the purpose of APÂ®, you do not need to have detailed information about myriad types
of nervous systems in other animals. Instead, just focus on the complex nervous system of humans.) The basic structure of
the nervous system that reflects function is the neuron, of which there are three types: sensory, motor, and interneuron. A
typical neuron consists of dendrites, a cell body, and an axon to detect, generate, transmit, and integrate signal information.
Many neurons are surrounded by Schwann cells (a type of glial cell) that form a myelin sheath, which acts as an elect
