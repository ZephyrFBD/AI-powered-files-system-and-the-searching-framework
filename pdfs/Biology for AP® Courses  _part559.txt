e prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium,
potassium, calcium, and chloride must have special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino
acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes, achieved by various transmembrane proteins (channels).
Diffusion
Diffusion is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area
of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through
the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people. The ammonia gas is at
its highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room. The ammonia vapor will diffuse,

or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. Materials move
