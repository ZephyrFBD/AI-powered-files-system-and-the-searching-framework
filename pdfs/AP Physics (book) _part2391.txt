[*A changing current in a coil of wire will produce a
changing magnetic field that induces an emf in a second coil
placed nearby. The mutual inductance, M, is defined by
(21;8)]
[*Within a single coil, the changing B due to a changing
current induces an opposing emf,
so a coil has a
self-inductance L defined by
(21;9)]
[*The energy stored in an inductance L carrying current I
is given by 
This energy can be thought of as being
stored in the magnetic field of the inductor. The energy density u
in any magnetic field B is given by
(21;10)]
[*When an inductance L and resistor R are connected in
series to a source of emf,
the current rises as
where 
is the time constant. If
