g devices) to measure the actual percent change in light absorbance, the 
rate is usually referred to as absolute rate of the reaction. In this case, a specific amount 
of time can be measured, such as 0.083 absorbance/minute.

■ Procedure 1: Developing a Method for Measuring Peroxidase 
in Plant Material and Determining a Baseline 
Peroxide (such as hydrogen peroxide) is a toxic byproduct of aerobic metabolism. 
Peroxidase is an enzyme that breaks down these peroxides. It is produced by most cells 
in their peroxisomes. 
The general reaction can be depicted as follows: 
Enzyme + Substrate --> Enzyme-Substrate Complex --> Enzyme + Product(s) + ∆G 
For this investigation the specific reaction is as follows: 
Peroxidase + Hydrogen Peroxide --> Complex --> Peroxidase + Water + Oxygen 
2H O → 2H O + O  (gas)

Notice that the peroxidase is present at the start and end of the reaction. Like all 
catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reac
