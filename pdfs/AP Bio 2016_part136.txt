izes glucose absorption from the intestinal lumen into the epithelial cells and from the 
epithelial cells into the blood. (3 points) 
Description (1 point) 
• Energy from the sodium gradient   
 
Explanation (2 points maximum) 
• The Na+/K+ pump maintains the sodium concentration gradient and allows for the 
cotransport of glucose  
• The symport/inflow of glucose maintains a glucose concentration gradient between 
the epithelial cells and the blood and allows for (facilitated) diffusion of glucose  
• The microvilli/folds on the lumen side of the epithelial cell provide more surface area 
for uptake of glucose into the epithelial cell
