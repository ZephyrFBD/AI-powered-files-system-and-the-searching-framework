w down the released neutrons.
The fusion process, in which small nuclei combine to form
larger ones, also releases energy. The energy from our Sun origi-
nates in the fusion reactions known as the proton;proton chain
in which four protons fuse to form a 
nucleus producing
25 MeV of energy. A useful fusion reactor for power generation
has not yet proved possible because of the difficulty in containing
the fuel (e.g., deuterium) long enough at the extremely high
temperature required 
Nonetheless, progress has been

made in confining the collection of charged ions known as 
a plasma. The two main methods are magnetic confinement,
using a magnetic field in a device such as the donut-shaped
tokamak, and inertial confinement in which intense laser beams
compress a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium.
Radiation can cause damage to materials, including biolog-
ical tissue. Quantifying amounts
