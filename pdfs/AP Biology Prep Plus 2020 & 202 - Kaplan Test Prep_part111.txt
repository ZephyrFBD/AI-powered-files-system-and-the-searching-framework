(A), (B), and (D) are incorrect
because all of these groups demonstrated lower rates of survival.
3. B

Because larger birds are more likely to survive, there is selection for
larger size. This means that birds may become larger in future
generations unless other selective pressures against larger size arise.
(B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because no information is given
about the availability of food. (C) is incorrect because no information is
given concerning the reproductive cycles of the birds. (D) is incorrect
because non-human animals do not simply decide to change their
behavior as a species in response to environmental circumstances; if
behavior in a species of non-human animals changes, it is almost
always the result of selective pressures that favor one kind of behavior
over another, with those organisms that behave in the way that is
selected against eventually being removed from the gene pool.
