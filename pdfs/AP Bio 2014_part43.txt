ction 
and fruit ripening? 
(A) As a result of metabolic inactivity, newly 
harvested fruits are unable to absorb 
ethylene gas from the atmosphere. 
(B) Ethylene gas is a chemical signal through 
which ripening fruits trigger the ripening 
process in other fruits. 
(C) Because of normal phenotypic variation, only 
some of the fruits in a given generation are 
expected to produce ethylene gas. 
(D) The rate of ethylene gas production by 
ripening fruits is an indicator of the relative 
age of an ecosystem.

 5. Water in a pond contaminated with the  
weed killer atrazine is suspected of inhibiting 
metamorphosis in northern leopard frogs.  
A team of scientists collected fertilized northern 
leopard frog eggs from a different pond that is not 
contaminated. Which of the following is the best 
experimental design to determine whether atrazine 
is responsible for inhibiting met
