 and use that value to 
identify the gas. The tools available to you are several empty mylar 
balloons that are about the size of a grapefruit when inflated (gases 
diffuse through mylar much more slowly than conventional latex 
balloons), an analytical balance, and three graduated glass bea-
kers of different sizes (100 mL, 500 mL, and 2 L). (a) To how many 
significant figures would you need to determine the molar mass 
to identify the gas? (b) Propose an experiment or series of exper-
iments that would allow you to determine the molar mass of the 
unknown gas. Describe the tools, calculations, and assumptions 
you would need to use. (c) If you had access to a broader range of 
analytical instruments, describe an alternative way you could iden-
tify the gas using any experimental methods that you have learned 
about in the earlier chapters.
