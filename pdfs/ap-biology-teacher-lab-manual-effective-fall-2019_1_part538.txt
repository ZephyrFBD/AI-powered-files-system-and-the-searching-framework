asmids also let us 
move DNA from one bacterium to another easily. 
In this investigation, you will learn how to transform Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria 
with DNA it has not possessed before so that it expresses new genetic information. 
Bacterial cells that are able to take up exogenous (external) genetic material are 
said to be “competent” and are capable of being transformed. You also will calculate 
transformation efficiency to find out how well the E. coli took up the “foreign” 
DNA. Using these techniques, you will have the opportunity to explore the field of 
biotechnology further. You might want to explore the following questions: 
•  What causes mutations in bacteria? Can mutations affect plasmids? 
•  What is the function of plasmids in bacteria? 
•  Do cells take up more plasmids in some conditions and less in others? 
By learning and applying these fundamental skills, you will acquire the tools to 
conduct more sophisticated biotechnology investigations, including de
