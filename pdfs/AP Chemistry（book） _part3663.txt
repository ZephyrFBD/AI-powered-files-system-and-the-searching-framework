ning ligands are Cl- ions. 
The central metal and the ligands bound to it constitute the coordination sphere of 
the complex.
In writing the chemical formula for a coordination compound, Werner suggested 
using square brackets to signify the makeup of the coordination sphere in any given 
compound. He therefore proposed that CoCl3 # 6 NH3 and CoCl3 # 5 NH3 are better writ-
ten as 3Co(NH3)64Cl3 and 3Co(NH3)5Cl4Cl2, respectively. He further proposed that the 
chloride ions that are part of the coordination sphere are bound so tightly that they do 
not dissociate when the complex is dissolved in water. Thus, dissolving 3Co(NH3)5Cl4Cl2 
in water produces a 3Co(NH3)5Cl42+ ion and two Cl- ions.
Werner’s ideas also explained why there are two forms of CoCl3 # 4 NH3. Using Wer-
ner’s postulates, we write the formula as 3Co(NH3)4Cl24Cl. As shown in Figure 23.8, there 
are two ways to arrange the ligands in the 3Co(NH3)4Cl24+ complex, called the cis and 
trans forms. In the cis form, the two chl
