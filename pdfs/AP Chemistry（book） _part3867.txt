oteins are a@amino acids, where the a 
(alpha) indicates that the amino group is located on the carbon atom immediately adja-
cent to the carboxylic acid group. Thus, there is always one carbon atom between the 
amino group and the carboxylic acid group.
The general formula for an a@amino acid is represented by

Give It Some Thought
What are the requirements on the four groups attached to a carbon atom in order 
that it be a chiral center?

CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
The doubly ionized form, called a zwitterion, usually predominates at near-neutral pH 
values. This form is a result of the transfer of a proton from the carboxylic acid group to 
the amine group. 
 (Section 16.10: “The Amphiprotic Behavior of Amino Acids”)
Amino acids differ from one another in the nature of their R groups. Twenty-two 
amino acids occur naturally in protei
