The crucial aspect of a good conductor is that the highest energy band con-
taining electrons is only partially filled. Consider sodium metal, for example, whose
energy bands are shown in Fig. 29–24. The 1s, 2s, and 2p bands are full (just as in
a sodium atom) and don’t concern us. The 3s band, however, is only half full. To
see why, recall that the exclusion principle stipulates that in an atom, only two
electrons can be in the 3s state, one with spin up and one with spin down. These
two states have slightly different energy. For a solid consisting of N atoms, the 3s
band will contain 2N possible energy states. A sodium atom has a single 3s electron,
so in a sample of sodium metal containing N atoms, there are N electrons in the
3s band, and N unoccupied state
