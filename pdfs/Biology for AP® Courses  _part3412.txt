ided into three classes based
on their chemical structure. Explain these classes and give
one factor that distinguishes each.
a.
The classes are peptide hormones, which are
water insoluble, and amino acid-derived and
lipid-derived hormones, which are water soluble.
b.
The classes are lipid-derived hormones, which
are water insoluble, and amino acid-derived and
peptide hormones, which are water soluble.
c.
The classes are lipid-derived hormones, which
are water soluble, and amino acid-derived and
peptide hormones, which are water insoluble.
d.
The classes are amino acid-derived hormones,
which are water insoluble, and lipid-derived and
peptide hormones, which are water soluble.
36. Explain how hormones promote homeostasis in the
body.
a.
Hormones increases cell activity by binding to
the receptors present in the cell.
b.
Hormones facilitate communication between
cells present at very distant locations in the body.
c.
Hormones facilitate communication between
cells at any distance in the
