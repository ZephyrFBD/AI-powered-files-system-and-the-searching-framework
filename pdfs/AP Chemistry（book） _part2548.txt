 a pH of 2.34. What is the 
concentration of the acid?
What is the pH of (a) a 0.028 M solution of NaOH, (b) a 0.0011 M solution of Ca1OH22?
Sample Exercise 16.9 
Calculating the pH of a Strong Base
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to calculate the pH of two solutions of strong 
bases.
Plan We can calculate each pH by either of two equivalent meth-
ods. First, we could use Equation 16.16 to calculate 3H+4 and then 
use Equation 16.17 to calculate the pH. Alternatively, we could 
use 3OH -4 to calculate pOH and then use Equation 16.20 to cal-
culate the pH.
Solve
(a) NaOH dissociates in water to give one OH- ion per formula 
unit. Therefore, the OH - concentration for the solution in (a) 
equals the stated concentration of NaOH, namely 0.028 M.
Method 1:
3H+4 = 1.0 * 10-14
0.028
= 3.57 * 10-13 M
 
   pH = -log13.57 * 10-132 = 12.45
Method 2:
pOH = -log10.0282 = 1.55
pH = 14.00 - pOH = 12.45
(b) Ca1OH22 is a strong base that dissociates in water to give two 
OH - ions per formula unit. Thus
