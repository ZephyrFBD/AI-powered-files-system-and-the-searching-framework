much the same way as with cellular DNA. Group II viruses have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as their genome. They
convert their single-stranded genomes into a dsDNA intermediate before transcription to mRNA can occur. Group III
viruses use dsRNA as their genome. The strands separate, and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mRNA
using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus. Group IV viruses have ssRNA as their genome with a
positive polarity. Positive polarity means that the genomic RNA can serve directly as mRNA. Intermediates of dsRNA,
called replicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic RNA. Multiple, full-length RNA strands

of negative polarity (complementary to the positive-stranded genomic RNA) are formed from these intermediates, which
may then serve as templates for the production of RNA with positive polar
