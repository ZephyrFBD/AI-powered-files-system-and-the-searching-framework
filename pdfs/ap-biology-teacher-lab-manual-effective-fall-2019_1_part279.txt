 Proteins,” click on the first file name. It will be named “NM 
001100.3” or something similar. These standardized numbers make cataloging 
sequence files easier. Do not worry about the file number for now. 
4. Just below the gene title click on “FASTA.” This is the name for a particular format 
for displaying sequences. 
5. The nucleotide sequence displayed is that of the actin gene in humans. 
6. Copy the entire gene sequence, and then go to the BLAST homepage   
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

 Click on “nucleotide blast” under the Basic BLAST menu. 
8. Paste the sequence into the box where it says “Enter Query Sequence.” 
9. Give the query a title in the box provided if you plan on saving it for later.
