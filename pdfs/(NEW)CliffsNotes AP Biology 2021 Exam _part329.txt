xed base-pairing requirement, called wobble pairing,
allows the anticodon of some tRNAs to base-pair with more than one kind of codon. As a result, about 45 different
tRNAs base-pair with the 61 codons that code for amino acids.
3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules combine with various proteins to form ribosomes. The rRNA molecules are
transcribed in the nucleolus and assembled with proteins imported from the cytoplasm to form a large and a small
ribosome subunit. In the cytoplasm, the two subunits join to form a ribosome that coordinates the activities of the
mRNA and tRNA during translation.

Transcription
Transcription begins with initiation, continues with elongation, and ends with termination. The details follow, with
numbers corresponding to events illustrated in Figure 9-5:
1. In initiation, the RNA polymerase attaches to a promoter region on the DNA and begins to unzip the DNA into
two strands. A promoter region for mRNA transcriptions often contains the sequence T-A-T-A
