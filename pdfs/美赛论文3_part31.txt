3.2.3.2 The ‘suffering degree’ during the adding and fusion process
From even loop model, the temperature of the water in the bathtub at any time
after adding water into the bathtub and any position in the bathtub can be confirmed
by the function ( , , , )
u x y z t . Hence, the ‘suffering degree’ during this time can be
