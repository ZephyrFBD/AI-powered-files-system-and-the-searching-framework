and Plan Because cesium is an alkali metal, we expect its 
chemistry to be dominated by oxidation of the metal to Cs+ ions. 
Further, we recognize that Cs is far down the periodic table, which 
means it is among the most active of all metals and probably re-
acts with all three substances.
Solve The reaction between Cs and Cl2 is a simple combination 
reaction between a metal and a nonmetal, forming the ionic com-
pound CsCl:
2 Cs1s2 + Cl21g2 ¡ 2 CsCl1s2
From Equations 7.18 and 7.16, we predict the reactions of ce-
sium with water and hydrogen to proceed as follows:
 2 Cs1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 CsOH1aq2 + H21g2 
 2 Cs1s2 + H21g2 ¡ 2 CsH1s2
All three reactions are redox reactions where cesium forms a 
Cs+ ion. The Cl-, OH-, and H- are all 1- ions, which means the 
products have 1:1 stoichiometry with Cs+.
