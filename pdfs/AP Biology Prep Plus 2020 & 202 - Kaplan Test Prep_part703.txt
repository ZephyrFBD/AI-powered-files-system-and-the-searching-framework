and
migration can aﬀect these inheritance patterns.
Now comes the hard part: putting information into equations. The way to
determine the frequencies of the alleles in your breeding population is to
assume the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If your
population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, two things will be true.
First, the addition of the frequencies of the alleles will equal one. The
simple formula is:

p + q = 1
where the frequency of the dominant allele is indicated by p and the
frequency of the recessive allele is indicated by q. For this experiment, p =
T and q = t. The frequencies of the phenotypes in a Hardy-Weinberg
population follow the equation:
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
The genotypes in a Hardy-Weinberg population are indicated by each
term on the leȇ side of the previous equation. The frequency of the
homozygous dominant phenotype in the population above is:
T × T = T2 = p2
The frequency of the heterozygot
