1.2.1 Values of a Function: Domain and Range 
A complete graph of a function contains all the information about a function, because the 
graph tells us which input values correspond to which output values. 
To analyze the graph of a function, we must keep in mind that the height of the graph is 
the value of the function. So we can read off the values of a function from its graph. 
 
Example 1 
The function T graphed in the figure gives the temperature between noon and 6:00 P.M. at 
a certain weather station. 
 
(a) Find T (1), T (3), and T (5). 
(b) Which is larger, T(2) or T (4)? 
(c) Find the value(s) of x for which T (x) = 25. 
(d) Find the value(s) of x for which T (x) â‰¥ 25. 
(e) Find the net change in temperature fr
