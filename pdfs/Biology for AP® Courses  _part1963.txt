servations of finches by Charles Darwin visiting the Galapagos Islands in the 1800s provide the foundation for
our modern understanding of evolution?
The theory of evolution as proposed by Darwin is the unifying theory of biology. The tenet that all life has evolved and
diversified from a common ancestor is the foundation from which we approach all questions in biology. As we learned in
our exploration of the structure and function of DNA, variations in individuals within a population occur through mutation,
allowing more desirable traits to be passed to the next generation. Due to competition for resources and other environmental
pressures, individuals possessing more favorable adaptive characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing
those characteristics to the next generation with increased frequency. When environments change, what was once an
unfavorable trait may become a favorable one. Organisms may evolve in response to their changing environment by the
