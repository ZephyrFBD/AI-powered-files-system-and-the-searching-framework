Figure 2.14 Oil and water do not mix. As this macro image of oil and water shows, oil does not dissolve in water but
forms droplets instead. This is due to it being a nonpolar compound. (credit: Gautam Dogra).
Water’s States: Gas, Liquid, and Solid
The formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. As water
molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other
liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life.
In liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. The breaking
of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system.
When the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen
