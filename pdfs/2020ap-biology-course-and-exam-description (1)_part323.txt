Figure 2. Susceptibility of A. gambiae mosquitoes from two regions to the 
pyrethroids deltamethrin and permethrin. A mosquito strain that is susceptible to

exposed to untreated filter paper displayed less than 10% mortality. Error bars 
represent standard deviation. “ND” means no data are available.
