EGULATION
When glucose and lactose are both present in the intestine, E. coli
preferentially metabolize glucose and the enzymes for breaking down
glucose are always present. However, when lactose is present and glucose
is in short supply, E. coli switch to lactose as an energy source. This ability
depends on the interaction of an allosteric regulatory protein, CAP
(catabolite activator protein), and cAMP (cyclic-AMP). Since the
attachment of CAP to the promoter directly stimulates gene expression,
this mechanism is an example of positive gene regulation.
VOCABULARY FOR THE OPERON
RNA polymerase: Enzyme that transcribes a new RNA chain by
linking ribonucleotides to nucleotides on a DNA template.
Operator: Sequence of nucleotides near the start of an operon to
which the active repressor can attach. The binding of the repressor
prevents RNA polymerase from attaching to the promoter and
transcribing the operonâ€™s genes.
Promoter: Nucleotide sequence in the DNA of a gene that is the
binding
