s (or parts of them, if they undergo chemical change) can
be detected by a Geiger or scintillation counter, which detects emitted radiation
(see Section 30â€“13). How food molecules are digested, and to what parts of the
body they are diverted, can be traced in this way.
Radioactive tracers have been used to determine how amino acids and other
essential compounds are synthesized by organisms. The permeability of cell walls
to various molecules and ions can be determined using radioactive tracers: the
tagged molecule or ion is injected into the extracellular fluid, and the radioactivity
present inside and outside the cells is measured as a function of time.
In a technique known as autoradiography, the position of the radioactive
isotopes is detected on film. For example, the distribution of carbohydrates
produced in the leaves of plants from absorbed

the plant in an atmosphere where the carbon atom in the
