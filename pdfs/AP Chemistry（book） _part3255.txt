These cells employ hydrogen gas as the fuel and oxygen gas from air as the oxidant and 
generate about 1 V.
Fuel cells are often named for either the fuel or the electrolyte used. In the 
hydrogen-PEM fuel cell (the acronym PEM stands for either proton-exchange mem-
brane or polymer-electrolyte membrane), the anode and cathode are separated by 
a membrane that is permeable to protons but not to electrons (Figure 20.24). The 
membrane therefore acts as the salt bridge. The electrodes are typically made from 
graphite.
The hydrogen-PEM cell operates at around 80 °C. At this temperature, the 
electrochemical reactions would normally occur very slowly, and so small islands of plat-
inum are deposited on each electrode to catalyze the reactions. The high cost and relative 
scarcity of platinum are two factors that limit wider use of hydrogen-PEM fuel cells.
In order to power a vehicle, multiple cells must be assembled into a fuel cell stack.
