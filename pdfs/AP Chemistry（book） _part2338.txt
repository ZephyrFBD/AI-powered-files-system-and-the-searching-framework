re subject to 
“poisoning,” which shuts down their catalytic ability. 
Compounds of sulfur are often poisons. Suggest a mecha-
nism by which such compounds might act as poisons.
 [14.85] The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction 
CO21g2 + H2O1l2 ¡ HCO3
-1aq2 + H+1aq2. In water, 
without the enzyme, the reaction proceeds with a rate 
constant of 0.039 s-1 at 25 °C. In the presence of the en-
zyme in water, the reaction proceeds with a rate constant 
of 1.0 * 106 s-1 at 25 °C. Assuming the collision factor is 
the same for both situations, calculate the difference in 
activation energies for the uncatalyzed versus enzyme- 
catalyzed reaction.
 [14.86] The enzyme urease catalyzes the reaction of urea, 
1NH2CONH22, with water to produce carbon dioxide and 
ammonia. In water, without the enzyme, the reaction pro-
ceeds with a first-order rate constant of 4.15 * 10-5 s-1 at 
100 °C. In the presence of the enzyme in water, the reac-
tion proceeds with a rate constant of 3.4 * 104 s
