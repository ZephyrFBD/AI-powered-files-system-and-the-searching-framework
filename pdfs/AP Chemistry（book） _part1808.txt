mates by evaporating it from the surfaces of canvas bags or 
porous clay pots. How many grams of water can be cooled 
from 35 to 20 °C by the evaporation of 60 g of water? (The 
heat of vaporization of water in this temperature range is 
2.4 kJ>g. The speciﬁc heat of water is 4.18 J>g@K.)
 11.44  Compounds like CCl2F2 are known as chloroﬂuorocarbons, 
or CFCs. These compounds were once widely used as refrig-
erants but are now being replaced by compounds that are 
believed to be less harmful to the environment. The heat 
of vaporization of CCl2F2 is 289 J>g. What mass of this sub-
stance must evaporate to freeze 200 g of water initially at 
15 °C? (The heat of fusion of water is 334 J>g; the speciﬁc 
heat of water is 4.18 J>g@K.)
 11.45  Ethanol 1C2H5OH2 melts at -114 °C and boils at 78 °C. 
The enthalpy of fusion of ethanol is 5.02 kJ>mol, and its 
enthalpy of vaporization is 38.56 kJ>mol. The speciﬁc heats 
of solid and liquid ethanol are 0.97 and 2.3 J>g@K, respec-
tively. (a) How
