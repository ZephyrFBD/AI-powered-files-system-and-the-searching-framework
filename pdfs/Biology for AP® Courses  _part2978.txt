In reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown in Figure 25.21, the first response is that of salivation.
The salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by the food
in preparation for digestion. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. Recall that
the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. The
brain prepares these muscles for movement as well. When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals
fullness. There are three overlapping phases of gastric control—the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal
phase—each requires many enzymes and is under neural control as well.
