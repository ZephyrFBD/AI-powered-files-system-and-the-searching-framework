es P has traits 2, 3, and 4, so trait 1 is placed after the
branch point for P but before the branch point for L. Species O has traits 2 and 3, so trait 4 is placed after the
branch point for O but before the branch point for P. The only trait species N has is trait 2, so trait 3 is placed
after the branch point for N but before the branch point for O. Trait 2 is placed before the branch point for N.
Choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect in their placements of the traits and the species.
9. (B) Species N is the outgroup because it has the least in common with the other species, sharing only trait 2.
Choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because every other species shares two or more traits with the others in
the cladogram.
10. (B) Sympatric speciation occurs when two species are separated by genetic differences. Choice (A) is incorrect
because allopatric speciation requires geographic separation, which is not the case in this example. Polygenic
inheritance is when more than one gen
