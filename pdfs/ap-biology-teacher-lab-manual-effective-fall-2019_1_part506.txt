 with agar, you will not be able to make 
control plates containing just nutrient agar. 
Fill each plate to about one-third to one-half (approximately 12 mL) with agar 
and replace the lid. You may want to stack the plates and let them cool in the stacked 
configuration. 
Second, add the hydrated ampicillin to the remaining LB nutrient agar. Swirl 
briefly to mix. Pour into the 16 plates labeled LB/amp using the same technique. 
Plates should set within 30 minutes. 
5. Store the plates. 
After the plates have cured for two days at room temperature, they may be either 
used or stored by stacking them in a plastic sleeve bag slipped back down over them. 
The stack is then inverted, the bag taped closed, and the plates stored upside down 
at 4°C until used. (The plates are inverted to prevent condensation on the lid, which 
may drip onto the agar.)
