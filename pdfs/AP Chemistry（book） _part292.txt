 show a repeating, or periodic, pattern. For example, each of the soft, reactive met-
als—lithium, sodium, and potassium—comes immediately after one of the nonreactive 
gases—helium, neon, and argon, respectively—as shown in Figure 2.13.

▲ Figure 2.13 Arranging elements by atomic number reveals a periodic pattern of properties.  
This pattern is the basis of the periodic table.

If F is a reactive nonmetal, which other element or elements shown here 
are likely to be reactive nonmetals?
The arrangement of elements in order of increasing atomic number, with elements 
having similar properties placed in vertical columns, is known as the periodic table 
(Figure 2.14). The table shows the atomic number and atomic symbol for each element, 
and the atomic weight is often given as well, as
