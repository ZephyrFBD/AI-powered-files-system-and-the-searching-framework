nvironmental factors, such as chemicals or radiation, or by random errors in DNA
replication or DNA repair mechanisms.
Mistakes in mitosis or meiosis can also lead to mutations. Failure of homologous chromosomes to separate
during meiosis can lead to an aneuploidy (an incorrect number of chromosomes). Aneuploidies in animals can be
fatal or may cause sterility or other disorders. However, in plants, aneuploidies that result in polyploids (an entire
extra set of chromosomes) can confer an advantage to the plant, making it more likely to survive.
Genetic mutations can also be transmitted horizontally between members of the same generation. Some methods
of horizontal transmission of genetic information include:
Transformation—the uptake of naked foreign DNA by a cell
Transduction—the transmission of DNA from one organism to another by viruses; as the virus transfers the
DNA, the DNA sequence may be recombined or otherwise changed, leading to new mutations and variations
Conjugation—the tr
