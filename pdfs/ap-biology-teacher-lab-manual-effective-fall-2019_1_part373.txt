 you are truly stumped, your instructor can give you some guidance. Keep in 
mind that leaves with hairy surfaces should be avoided. Ivy and spinach work well, but 
many others do as well. Differences between plants may be one of the ideas that you 
want to investigate. 
2. Use your results to prepare a lab report/mini-poster for a classroom peer review 
presentation. See Chapter 2 for guidance on this. 
■ Additional Guidelines 
1. Consider combining variables as a way to describe differences between different 
plants. For instance, if you investigate how light intensity affects the rate of 
photosynthesis, you might generate a “photosynthesis light response curve”—the 
rate of photosynthesis at different light intensities. The shape of this curve may 
change for different plants or plants in different light environments. The “light 
response curve” is a form of measurement itself. How do you think a light response 
curve (the first variable) for a shade-grown leaf compares to that of
