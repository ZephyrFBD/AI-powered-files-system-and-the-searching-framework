e transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by
hormones. Sodium (Na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to
the peritubular capillaries. Because Na+ is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic
pressure. Water is also independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water
channels, in the PCT. This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries.
However, every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed.
In the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes;
the opposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally
high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and conc
