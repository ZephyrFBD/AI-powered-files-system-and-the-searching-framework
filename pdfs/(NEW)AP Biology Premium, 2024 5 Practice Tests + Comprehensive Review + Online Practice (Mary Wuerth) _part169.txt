f enzyme-
catalyzed reactions, usually by binding to the active site or the substrate, which enhances the binding of the substrate
to the active site.
Many of the vitamins and minerals in the foods you eat function as coenzymes and cofactors. For example, B vitamins help your body make
the electron carrier NAD, which is important in cellular respiration, which will be discussed in Chapter 9.
Activation Energy in Chemical Reactions
All molecules have a given amount of free energy (G). The chemical reactions necessary for life involve changes in
molecules. Chemical reactions can be endergonic or exergonic. Endergonic reactions have products with a higher
free energy level than its reactants and are considered energetically unfavorable. Exergonic reactions have products
with a lower free energy level than its reactants and are considered energetically favorable.
TIP
Think of activation energy as being analogous to a speed bump in a parking lot. The higher the speed bump is, the slower the
