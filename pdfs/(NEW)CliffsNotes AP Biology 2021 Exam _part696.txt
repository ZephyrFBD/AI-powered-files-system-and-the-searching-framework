Small pox is an infectious human disease introduced to North America by Europeans in the sixteenth century.
Because populations originating in the Western Hemisphere lacked any natural immunity, the disease caused
widespread devastation among the Native American populations.
A number of factors influence the number and size of trophic levels in an ecosystem:
1. Size of bottom trophic level. Because primary producers provide the initial source of energy to the ecosystem,
their numbers and the amount of biomass they generate govern the size and makeup of all other trophic levels. Thus,
an ecosystem based on a small tier of primary producers cannot sustain many tiers above it.
2. Efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels. On average, there is a 10% decline (that is, an exponential
decline) in biomass and the energy it provides as it passes up through the tiers of the pyramid of energy. Thus, the
number of trophic levels th
