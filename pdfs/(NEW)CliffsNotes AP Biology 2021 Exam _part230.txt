tinue through the cell cycle. The three checkpoints are as follows (through the cell
cycle. The three checkpoints are as follows ( 6):
The G1 checkpoint occurs near the end of the G1 phase. Here,
the quality of the DNA is evaluated; if DNA damage is detected, DNA repair is attempted. If that fails, apoptosis, a
program for self-destruction, ensues. If nutrients or growth factors are absent, the cell proceeds no further through
the cell cycle, remaining in
an extended G1 phase until conditions are appropriate. Some
 
cells, like nerve or muscle cells, are genetically programmed not to divide, and remain in a G0 phase, rarely
dividing after they
 
have matured. Liver cells, on the other hand, can leave the G0
 
phase and return to dividing if they need to replace injured liver tissue.
 The G2 checkpoint, occurring at the end of the G2 phase of the
cell cycle, evaluates the accuracy of DNA replication and signals whether or not to begin mitosis. If DNA damage is
detected, DNA repair is at
