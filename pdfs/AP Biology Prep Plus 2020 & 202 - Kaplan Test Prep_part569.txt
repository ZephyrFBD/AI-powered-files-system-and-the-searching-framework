roteins
consistently produced from the same gene as a result of separate
mRNA mutations. (B) is incorrect because the mRNA sequences are
identical at some points, which would not be possible if both the sense
and antisense strands were being used. (D) is incorrect because the
proteins have diﬀering amino acid sequences, which would not result
simply from post-translational modifications. Moreover, (D) would not
explain why the mRNA sequences are themselves diﬀerent.
5. A
Learning Objective: 13.5
Messenger RNA is read in the 5′ to 3′ direction, so to convert the
codons to amino acids, simply move from leȇ to right and match each
one to the table. This yields a sequence of ser-ala-his-leu-tyr-val, as in
(A). (B) is incorrect because it mistakenly interprets the third and fiȇh
codons in the sequence. (C) is incorrect because it provides the
sequence if an antisense mRNA were translated (UCG becomes AGC,
GCA becomes CGU, etc.), but mRNA is read directly by the ribosome
without the creation
