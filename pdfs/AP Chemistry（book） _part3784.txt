 a strong-field 
ligand. What color might you expect carboxyhemoglobin 
to be?
 [23.84]  Consider the tetrahedral anions VO4
3- (orthovanadate 
ion), CrO4
2- (chromate ion), and MnO4
- (permanganate 
ion). (a) These anions are isoelectronic. What does this state-
ment mean? (b) Would you expect these anions to exhibit 
d-d transitions? Explain. (c) As mentioned in “A Closer 
Look” on charge-transfer color, the violet color of MnO4
- 
is due to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition. 
What is meant by this term? (d) The LMCT transition in 
MnO4
- occurs at a wavelength of 565 nm. The CrO4
2- ion 
is yellow. Is the wavelength of the LMCT transition for 
chromate larger or smaller than that for MnO4
-? Explain. 
 
(e) The VO4
3- ion is colorless. Do you expect the light 
absorbed by the LMCT to fall in the UV or the IR region of 
the electromagnetic spectrum? Explain your reasoning.
 23.85  Given the colors observed for VO4
3- (orthovanadate 
ion), CrO4
2- (chromate ion), and
