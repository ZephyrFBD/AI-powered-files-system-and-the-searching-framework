species Biston betularia (peppered moth) had a light
pattern. Dark colored moths were rare. By the late 19th
century, the light-colored moths were rare, and the moths
with dark patterns were abundant.
The cause of this change was hypothesized to be selective
predation by birds (J.W. Tutt, 1896). During the industrial
revolution, soot and other wastes from industrial processes
killed tree lichens and darkened tree trunks. Thus, prior to
the pollution of the industrial revolution, dark moths stood
out on light-colored trees and were vulnerable to
predators. With the rise of pollution, however, the coloring
of moths vulnerable to predators changed to light.
In the late 1900s, England cleaned up its air, and pollution
decreased. The bark of trees went from dark to light.
