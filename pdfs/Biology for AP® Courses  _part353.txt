ion and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer
reaction is specific to its class. Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation,
while hydrolysis reactions typically release energy by breaking bonds.
3.2 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural support to
plant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods that include lobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders. Carbohydrates are
classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the molecule.
Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming
disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. Glucose, galactose, and
fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and suc
