ight touch, also known as discriminative touch, is a light
pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed. The receptive fields of Merkel’s disks are small with well-
defined borders. That makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard.

Figure 27.5 Four of the primary mechanoreceptors in human skin are shown. Merkel’s disks, which are
unencapsulated, respond to light touch. Meissner’s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, and Krause
end bulbs are all encapsulated. Meissner’s corpuscles respond to touch and low-frequency vibration. Ruffini
endings detect stretch, deformation within joints, and warmth. Pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and
high-frequency vibration. Krause end bulbs detect cold.
Which of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is true?
a.
Meissner’s corpuscles extend far into the epidermis.
b.
Ruffini endings are the only encapsulated mech
