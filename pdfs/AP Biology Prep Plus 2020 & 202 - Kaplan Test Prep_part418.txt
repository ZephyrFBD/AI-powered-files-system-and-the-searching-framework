respiration of the seeds). To isolate variables you are
interested in from other variables, glass beads should be subjected to the

same experimental treatment (change in temperature) that the target
specimens, the live seeds, are subjected to. The glass bead sample is the
control group. Any measurable change in the dependent variable in the
control group must be removed from the dependent variable of the
target group.
Let’s say that when you heated your seeds to 35°C, the volume of gas in
the respirometer of the target group (live seeds) decreased by 0.3 mL, but
the volume of gas in the respirometer of the control group (glass beads)
increased by 0.1 mL. Something occurred in the respirometer of the
control group that caused an increase in gas volume. Perhaps the change
in volume in the respirometer was created by the expansion of heated
gas, or expansion was caused by CO2 not being absorbed by the soda
lime or other CO2 absor
