 Figure 2, predict a DNA point mutation that will result in a methionine-to-valine substitution. 
(1 point maximum; LO 4.3) 
• 
A  G 
OR 
AUG  GUG (from the codon table) 
• 
T  C  
• 
A/T  G/C 
 
(d) Propose THREE features of a model to connect the genetic mutation you predicted with the 
activity of a signaling pathway involving the LDS2B gene product. 
(3 points maximum; LO 2.28, 3.25, 4.9, 3.36) 
• 
Mutation causes a structural change in polypeptide. 
• 
Change in sequence activates signaling (a gain of function). 
• 
Change in sequence decreases signaling pathway (a loss of function). 
• 
An altered protein could change other components of the signaling pathway 
(downstream effect). 
 
o Buildup or loss of ATP 
o Increase or decrease of phosphorylated proteins 
o An effect on the overall cascade 
o Buildup or decrease of signal molecule  
o Interferes with the growth factor/affects growth
