represents solutions at various stages 
of the titration of a weak acid, HA, with NaOH. (The Na+ 
ions and water molecules have been omitted for clarity.) To 
which of the following regions of the titration curve does 
each drawing correspond: (a) before addition of NaOH, 
 
(b) after addition of NaOH but before the equivalence 
point, (c) at the equivalence point, (d) after the equiva-
lence point? [Section 17.3]

17.1  The following boxes represent aqueous solutions contain-
ing a weak acid, HA and its conjugate base, A-. Water mole-
cules, hydronium ions, and cations are not shown. Which 
solution has the highest pH? Explain. [Section 17.1]
 
17.3  A buffer contains a weak acid, HA, and its conjugate 
base. The weak acid has a pKa of 4.5, and the buffer has a 
pH of 4.3. Without doing a calculation, state which of 
these possibilities are correct at pH 4.3. (a) 3HA4 = 3A-4,  
(b) 3HA4 7 3A-4, or (c) 3HA4 6 3A-4. [Section 17.2]
