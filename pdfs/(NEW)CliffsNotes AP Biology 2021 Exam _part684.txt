r arthropods. Since the new soil is typically nutrient deficient, various nitrogen-fixing bacteria
appear early. Grasses, herbs, weeds, and other r-selected species are established next. Depending upon local climatic
conditions, r- selected species are eventually replaced by K-selected species such as perennial shrubs and trees.
Succession on sand dunes begins with the appearance of grasses adapted to taking root in shifting sands. These
grasses stabilize the sand after about six years. The subsequent stages of this succession can be seen on the dunes of
Lake Michigan. The stabilized sand allows the rooting of shrubs, followed by the establishment of cottonwoods.
Pines and black oaks follow over the next 50 to 100 years. Finally, the beech-maple climax community becomes
established. The entire process may require 1,000 years.
2. Secondary succession begins in habitats where communities were entirely or partially destroyed by some kind of
damaging event. For example, secondary successio
