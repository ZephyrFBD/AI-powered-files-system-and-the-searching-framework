 therefore, 
the average distance between the added electron and the 
nucleus steadily increases, causing the electron–nucleus 
attraction to decrease. However, the orbital that holds the 
outermost electron is increasingly spread out, so that as 
we proceed from F to I, the electron–electron repulsions 
are also reduced. As a result, the reduction in the electron–
nucleus attraction is counterbalanced by the reduction in 
electron–electron repulsions.

elements more negative than those of the Group 5A 
elements?
