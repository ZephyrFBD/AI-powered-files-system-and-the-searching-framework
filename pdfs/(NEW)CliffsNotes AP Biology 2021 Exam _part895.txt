 looked at the genotypes of the parents and recognized
that there could only be one possible genotype for offspring, but in cases where the parental genotypes are more
varied, you’ll have to do the math. For questions that, at first reading, appear extremely difficult, take a moment to
consider easy solutions.
5. Answer: –14
The free-energy change of a reaction is unaffected by the presence of an enzyme. It is the change in free energy from
its initial state to its final state. A reaction with a negative AG is an exergonic reaction and has a net release of
energy.
6. Answer: –17.3 (acceptable range: –16.8 to –17.8)
When the concentration of sucrose outside the bag (in the beaker) is isotonic to the solution inside the bag, there is
no net movement of solutes between the bag and the beaker and no net change in the bag weight. This occurs at 0.7
moles/liter on the graph. The water potential (Ψ) of the sucrose solution in the bag is the sum of its solute potential
(Ψs) and pressure potent
