Bullet Production of O2 (How many moles of O2 are produced for one mole of sugar 
synthesized?)
or
Bullet Consumption of CO2 (How many moles of CO2 are consumed for every mole of 
sugar synthesized?)
In this investigation, you will use a system that measures the accumulation of oxygen.

Because the spongy mesophyll layer of leaves (shown in Figure 1) is normally infused 
with gases (O2 and CO2), leaves — or disks cut from leaves — normally float in water. 
What would you predict about the density of the leaf disk if the gases are drawn from 
the spongy mesophyll layer by using a vacuum and replaced with water? How will 
that affect whether or not the leaf floats? If the leaf disk is placed in a solution with an 
alternate source of carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate ions, then photosynthesis 
can occur in a sunken leaf disk. As photosynthesis proceeds, oxygen accumulates in the
