es animals to move faster to flee or to capture prey
more effectively. Bilateral animals are all triploblastic, with an ectoderm,
mesoderm, and endoderm.
PHYLOGENETIC TREES
All living things evolved from a common ancestor almost 4 billion years
ago, which is why the principles of biology apply to all organisms. The
evolutionary history of these relationships is known as phylogeny. A
phylogenetic tree or cladogram is a diagrammatic reconstruction of that
history. Phylogenetic trees used to be based on morphology and physical
behaviors. Since more genomes have been sequenced, biologists are now
constructing phylogenetic trees based on DNA and evolutionary
relationships. Phylogenetic analysis of human mitochondrial DNA has
allowed scientists to construct a history of human migration out of Africa.
The growing database of DNA sequences enables researchers to study
more species, but it also makes building phylogenetic trees more complex.
A phylogenetic tree can usually be built in several d
