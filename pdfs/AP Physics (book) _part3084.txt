29. Use conservation of momentum to explain why photons
emitted by hydrogen atoms have slightly less energy than
that predicted by Eq. 27â€“10.
30. State if a continuous or a line spectrum is produced by
each of the following: (a) a hot solid object; (b) an
excited, rarefied gas; (c) a hot liquid; (d) light from a hot
solid that passes through a cooler rarefied gas; (e) a hot
dense gas. For each, if a line spectrum is produced, is it an
emission or an absorption spectrum?
31. Suppose we obtain an emission spectrum for hydrogen at
very high temperature (when some of the atoms are in
excited states), and an absorption spectrum at room tem-
perature, when all atoms are in the ground state. Will the
two spectra contain identical lines?
