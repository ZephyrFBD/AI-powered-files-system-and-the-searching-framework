f the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that species biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group increases as
latitude declines. In other words, biodiversity increases closer to the equator (Figure 38.3).
Figure 38.3 This map illustrates the number of amphibian species across the globe and shows the trend toward higher
biodiversity at lower latitudes. A similar pattern is observed for most taxonomic groups.
It is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the greater age of the ecosystems
in the tropics versus temperate regions that were largely devoid of life or drastically impoverished during the last glaciation.
The idea is that greater age provides more time for speciation. Another possible explanation is the increased energy the
tropics receive from the sun versus the decreased energy that temperate and polar regions receive. It is not entirely clear
how greater energy input could translate into more species. The complexity of trop
