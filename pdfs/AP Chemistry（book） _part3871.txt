The amino acid that furnishes the carboxyl group for peptide-bond formation is named 
first, with a -yl ending; then the amino acid furnishing the amino group is named. 
Using the abbreviations shown in Figure 24.16, we can abbreviate glycylalanine as 
either Gly-Ala or GA. In this notation, it is understood that the unreacted amino group 
is on the left and the unreacted carboxyl group on the right.
The artificial sweetener aspartame (Figure 24.17) is the methyl ester of the dipep-
tide formed from the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine.
