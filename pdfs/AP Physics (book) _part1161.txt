saw in Eq. 11–5b. Thus the projection on the x axis of an object revolving in a
circle has the same motion as a mass undergoing SHM.
We can now determine the period of SHM because it is equal to the time for
our object revolving in a circle to make one complete revolution. First we note that
the velocity 
is equal to the circumference of the circle (distance) divided by 
the period T:
(11;7)
We solve for the period T in terms of A:
From Eq. 11–5a,
Thus
which is Eq. 11–6a, the formula we were looking for. The period depends on the
mass m and the spring stiffness constant k, but not on the amplitude A.

Position as a Function of Time
We now use the reference circle to find the position of a mass undergoing simple
harmonic motion as a function of time. From Fig. 11–7, we see that 
so the projection of the object’s position on the x axis is
