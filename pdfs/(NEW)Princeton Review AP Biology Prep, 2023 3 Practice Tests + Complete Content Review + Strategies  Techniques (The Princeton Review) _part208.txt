gh levels will naturally diffuse out of the blood; dialysis just gives them the opportunity.
Exocytosis
Sometimes large particles are transported out of the cell. In exocytosis, a cell ejects waste products or specific
secretion products, such as hormones, by the fusion of a vesicle with the plasma membrane, which then expels the
contents into the extracellular space. Think of exocytosis as reverse endocytosis.
