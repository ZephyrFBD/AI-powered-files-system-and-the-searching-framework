RNA Compared to DNA
A. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure is similar to DNA in some ways, but has very important differences.
1. RNA and DNA are both composed of nucleotides and both have strands consisting of a sugar-
phosphate backbone with nitrogenous bases attached to their sugars.
2. RNA and DNA differ in the following significant ways:
i.
The 5-carbon sugar in RNAâ€™s backbone is ribose instead of deoxyribose.
ii. Instead of thymine, RNA uses the pyrimidine base, uracil.
iii. RNA does not form a stable double helix along its entire length with a complementary strand of
RNA, as DNA does.
RNA is often present in a single-stranded state, but it also can base pair with DNA, with
itself, and with other RNA molecules.
When RNA does form base pairs through hydrogen bonding, guanine pairs with cytosine,
and adenine pairs with uracil.
