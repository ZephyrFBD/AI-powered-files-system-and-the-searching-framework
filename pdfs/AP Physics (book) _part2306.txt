 changing flux through the coil induces an emf in the coil, produc-
ing a current. This induced current produces its own magnetic field. In Fig. 21–2a
the distance between the coil and the magnet decreases. The magnet’s magnetic
field (and number of field lines) through the coil increases, and therefore the flux
increases. The magnetic field of the magnet points upward. To oppose the upward
increase, the magnetic field produced by the induced current needs to point 
downward inside the coil. Thus, Lenz’s law tells us the current moves as shown in
Fig. 21–2a (use the right-hand rule). In Fig. 21–2b, the flux decreases (because the
magnet is moved away and B decreases), so the induced current in the coil produces
an upward magnetic field through the coil that is “trying” to maintain the status
quo. Thus the current in Fig. 21–2b is in the opposite direction from Fig. 21–2a.
It is important to note that an emf is induced whenever there is a change in
flux through the coil, and we now cons
