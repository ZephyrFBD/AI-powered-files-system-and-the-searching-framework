the system can be redefined so as to include the other
objects exerting these forces, then the conservation of momentum principle can
apply. For example, if we take as our system a falling rock, it does not conserve
momentum because an external force, the force of gravity exerted by the Earth,
accelerates the rock and changes its momentum. However, if we include the Earth in
the system, the total momentum of rock plus Earth is conserved. (This means that
the Earth comes up to meet the rock. But the Earth’s mass is so great, its upward
velocity is very tiny.)
Although the law of conservation of momentum follows from Newton’s
second law, as we have seen, it is in fact more general than Newton’s laws. In the
tiny world of the atom, Newton’s laws fail, but the great conservation laws—
those of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge—have been
found to hold in every experimental situation tested. It is for this reason that 
the conservation laws are considered more basic tha
