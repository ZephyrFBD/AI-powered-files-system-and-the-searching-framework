18.9  From study of Figure 18.23 describe the various ways in 
which operation of a fracking well site could lead to envi-
ronmental contamination.
 18.10  One mystery in environmental science is the imbalance 
in the “carbon dioxide budget.” Considering only human 
activities, scientists have estimated that 1.6 billion metric 
tons of CO2 is added to the atmosphere every year because 
of deforestation (plants use CO2, and fewer plants will 
leave more CO2 in the atmosphere). Another 5.5 billion 
tons per year is put into the atmosphere becau
