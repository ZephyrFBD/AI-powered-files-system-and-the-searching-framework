uce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance. Other vaccines may be adapted
to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or reproductive mucosa.
Finally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped
and microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune
response, this new generation of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn,
improve patient participation.
Activity
Construct a diagram to illustrate how T cells and B cells differ from each other with respect to the antigens
that they bind.
Think About It
Why is it advantageous to be able to mount a faster immune response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen? How
does the immune system accomplish this response?
Primary Centers of the Immune System
Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, m
