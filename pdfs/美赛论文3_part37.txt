. And water is
added only once. We regard the strategy as (36.3,7,7,1) .
5. Additional factors
Our model emphasizes three elements: even time, wasting water, and suffering
degree. In the model above, we ignore some minor factors to simplify the model to
some extent. These include that we regard the shape of bathtub as a rectangle, while
hot water column is a cylinder. When we back to the model mentioned above, we can
obtain the temperature at any time and position easily and gain the three elements we
focus on.
However, is this model sensitive and firm enough? How this kind of model
affects to conclusions? As a result, we will research the following seven elements in
seven different aspects to study sensitivity and reliability of our model. What’s more,
the third model---Analytic hierarchy process model---is based on the previous two
models, and we can abstract and evaluate three elements, so w
