any lysosomes. Cell Type B has more than twice as many
mitochondria as Cell Type A, about half the number of
ribosomes, many cilia, and very few lysosomes compared with
Cell Type A.
Structure determines function and vice versa. Cell Type A is a
cell whose function is related to digestion. Cell Type B could
either be a mobile cell, or it could serve some movement
function.
Cell Type A is probably a type of white blood cell (that digests
and destroys pathogens) because it has so many lysosomes,
which are sacs of digestive enzymes. In addition, digestive
enzymes are proteins, which are manufactured in ribosomes. As
expected, Cell Type A has a huge number of ribosomes. Cell
Type B is probably an epithelial cell that lines the human

respiratory system because it has many cilia. Cilia remove dust
and germs from the nasal passages, bronchi, and lungs.
These two cells were taken from one human body. That means
that they both contain identical DN
