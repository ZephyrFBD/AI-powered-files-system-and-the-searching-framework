by an enormous factor of 
or
more. Thus the edge of our 2-D sphere representing the entire universe would
have seemed flat to a high degree of precision, as shown in Fig. 33–30b. Even 
if the time of inflation was a factor of 10 or 100 (instead of 2), the expansion 
factor of 
or more would have blotted out any possibility of observing any-
thing but a flat universe.
CMB Uniformity
Inflation also explains why the CMB is so uniform. Without inflation, the tiny
universe at 
would not have been small enough for all parts of it to 
have been in contact and so reach the same temperature (information 
cannot travel faster than c). To see this, suppose that the currently observable
universe came from a region of space about 1 cm in diameter at 
as per original Big Bang theory. In that 
light could have traveled
way too small for the opposite sides
of a 1-cm-wide “universe” to have been in communication. But if that region had
been 
times smaller
as proposed by the inflation model, there
could
