Let us choose y to be positive in the
upward direction and negative in the downward direction. (This is a different
convention from that used in Examples 2–10 and 2–11, and so illustrates our
options.) The acceleration due to gravity is downward and so will have a nega-
tive sign,
As the ball rises, its speed decreases until it
reaches the highest point (B in Fig. 2–23), where its speed is zero for an
instant; then it descends, with increasing speed.
SOLUTION We consider the time interval from when the ball leaves the
thrower’s hand until the ball reaches the highest point. To determine the
maximum height, we calculate the position of the ball when its velocity equals
zero (
at the highest point). At  
(point A in Fig. 2–23) we have

and we wish to find y. We use Eq. 2–11c, replacing x
with y:
We solve this equation for y:
The ball reaches a height of 11.5 m above the hand.
