ance of acquired
characteristics emphasized changes to individual organisms during their lifetimes (acquired characteristics) and the inheritance of these acquired
characteristics by their offspring. While modern epigenetics (discussed in Chapter 17) shows that some changes to an organism’s DNA during its
lifetime (such as methylation patterns in the genome) may be inherited by its offspring, most acquired characteristics are not inherited by the next
generation.
Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection
Here are the core principles of Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection that you should understand and be
able to apply on the AP Biology exam:
Variations in populations lead to different phenotypes in members of a population.
Competition for limited resources, or predation, leads to some members of a population surviving while other
members of a population do not.
The environment determines which phenotypes are favorable.
Individuals with phenotypes that give them a survival adva
