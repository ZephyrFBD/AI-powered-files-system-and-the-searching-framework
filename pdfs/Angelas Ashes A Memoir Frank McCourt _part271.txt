pposed to be hanging around confession 
 
 boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not. 
 
 The panel slides back before my face and the priest says,Yes, my 
 
 child? 
 
 Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.This is my First Confession. 
 
 Yes,my child, and what sins have you committed? 
 
  
  
 I told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother’s purse. 
 
 I said a curse. 
 
 Yes,my child.Anything else? 
 
 I, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer. 
 
 Surely that’s not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by certain 
 
 writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his 
 
 King, Conor MacNessa. 
 
 ’Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him. 
 
 How was that,my child? 
 
 She won him in a pissing contest.

 There is heavy breathing.The priest has his hand over his mouth and 
 
 he’s making choking sounds and talking to himself,Mother o’ God. 
 
 Who, who told you that story,my child?
