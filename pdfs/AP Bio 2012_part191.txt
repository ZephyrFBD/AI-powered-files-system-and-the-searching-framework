ts environment. 
The student justifies that Anacharis must be adapted to an 
environment where transpiration does not occur, such as 
underwater or in 100 percent humidity because in either 
environment there would be no need for stomata. The 
student successfully connects all stomata on the upper 
epidermis to the water lily and justifies this to the water 
lilies’ environment on the surface of water. The student 
justifies the large number of stomata as the plant’s increasing 
its ability for gas exchange with no danger of excess water 
loss due to its environment. Lastly, the student connects 
the presence of stomata, limited to the lower leaf surface, 
to an understanding that black walnut is adapted to an 
environment where the upper surface is exposed to strong 
sunlight and higher temperatures and/or where water is 
more limited compared to an aquatic environment. Stomata 
located on the lower epidermis of leaves are shaded from 
exposure to direct sunlight and higher temperatur
