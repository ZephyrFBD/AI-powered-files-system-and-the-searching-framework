ed with ribosomes and produces proteins.
Smooth ER has three diverse functions:
Assists in the synthesis of steroid hormones, like sex hormones,
and of other lipids
Stores Ca++ ions in muscle cells to facilitate normal muscle
contractions
Detoxifies drugs and poisons from the body
Golgi Apparatus
The Golgi apparatus lies near the nucleus and consists of flattened
membranous sacs, called cisternae, stacked next to one another. The two
sides of a Golgi stack are referred to as a cis face (receiving department—
near the ER) and a trans face (shipping department—away from the ER).
Transport vesicles from the ER carry material to the cis face where they
enter the Golgi and are processed and packaged into vesicles. Next, they
are shipped out from the trans face to various parts of the cell. A cell may
have many or even hundreds of these Golgi stacks.
Lysosomes
Lysosomes are sacs of hydrolytic (digestive) enzymes surrounded by a
single membrane. They are the principal site of intracellular di
