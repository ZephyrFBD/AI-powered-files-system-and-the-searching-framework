 but
different structures. Because their structures are different, isomers have
different properties. There are three types of isomers: structural isomers,
cis-trans isomers, and enantiomers.
Structural isomers differ in the arrangement of their atoms. Cis-trans
isomers differ only in spatial arrangement around double bonds, which are
not flexible like single bonds are. Enantiomers are molecules that are
mirror images of each other. The mirror images are called the L- (left-
handed) and D- (right-handed) versions. Knowledge of enantiomers is
important in the pharmaceutical industry because the two mirror images
may not be equally effective. For example, L-dopa is a drug used in the
effective treatment of Parkinson’s disease. However, D-dopa, its
enantiomer, is biologically inactive and useless in the treatment of the
disease. For some reason that we do not understand, all the amino acids in
cells are left-handed. See Figure 2.4.
