period a»áer birth or hatching. Compared to innate behavior, learned
behavior is largely independent of inheritance and dependent on the
environmental context, so if the context disappears, the behavior will
also disappear. As a result, learned behavior spreads through a
population, passes within a single generation, and develops/degrades
more rapidly than innate behavior. By obtaining knowledge and/or skills,
organisms can modify learned behaviors to survive in unpredictable
environments. For example, a mouse can learn how to run through a
maze to reach a piece of cheese.
Innate and learned behaviors are not mutually exclusive and may
influence behavior together. In honeybees, genes associated with
foraging behavior determine whether bees are foragers or workers and
whether they forage for pollen or for nectar. However, foraging
performance is also correlated with learning. The ability to adjust
