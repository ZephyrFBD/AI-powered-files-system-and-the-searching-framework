ide the tube, fluorescent minerals some distance away would glow, and
photographic film would become exposed. Roentgen attributed these effects to
a new type of radiation (different from cathode rays). They were given the name
X-rays after the algebraic symbol x, meaning an unknown quantity. He soon found
that X-rays penetrated through some materials better than through others, and
within a few weeks he presented the first X-ray photograph (of his wife’s hand).
The production of X-rays today is usually done in a tube (Fig. 25–36) similar to
Roentgen’s, using voltages of typically 30 kV to 150 kV.
