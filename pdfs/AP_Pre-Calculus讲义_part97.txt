3.10 Trigonometric Equations 
3.10.1 Basic Trigonometric Equations 
Solving any trigonometric equation always reduces to solving a basic trigonometric 
equation—an equation of the form T( ) = c, where T is a trigonometric function and c is a 
constant. 
In the next examples we solve such basic equations. 
 
Example 1 
Solve the equation

Example 2 
Solve the equation tan  = 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.10.2 Solving Equations by Factoring 
Factoring is one of the most useful techniques for solving equations, including 
trigonometric equations. 
The idea is to move all terms to one side of the equation, factor, and then use the Zero-
Product Property.
