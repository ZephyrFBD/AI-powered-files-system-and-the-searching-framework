a period of glaciation and then warming. The extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by
about 1 million years. The first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming. The
climate changes affected temperatures and sea levels. Some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a
nearby supernova, is a possible cause of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The gamma-ray burst would have stripped away

at the time. The hypothesis is speculative, but extraterrestrial influences on Earth’s history are an active line of research.
Recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the location.
