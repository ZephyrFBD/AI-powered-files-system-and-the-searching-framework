As ATP is used for energy, a phosphate group or two are detached, and either ADP or AMP is produced. Energy derived

from glucose catabolism is used to convert ADP into ATP. When ATP is used in a reaction, the third phosphate is
temporarily attached to a substrate in a process called phosphorylation. The two processes of ATP regeneration that are
used in conjunction with glucose catabolism are substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation through
the process of chemiosmosis.
7.2 Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the first pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy. It was probably one of the earliest
metabolic pathways to evolve and is used by nearly all of the organisms on earth. Glycolysis consists of two parts: The
first part prepares the six-carbon ring of glucose for cleavage into two three-carbon sugars. ATP is invested in the proce
