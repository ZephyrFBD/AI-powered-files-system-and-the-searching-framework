 damage after DNA is replicated, and if there is damage, it prevents the cell from 
going into mitosis. The M-spindle (metaphase) checkpoint assures that the mitotic 
spindles or microtubules are properly attached to the kinetochores (anchor sites on the 
chromosomes). If the spindles are not anchored properly, the cell does not continue on 
through mitosis. The cell cycle is regulated very precisely. Mutations in cell cycle genes 
that interfere with proper cell cycle control are found very often in cancer cells.
