around inside the metal is estimated
to be about 
at 
, very much greater than the drift velocity.
The drift velocity of electrons in a wire is slow, only about 
in
Example 18–14, which means it takes an electron about 
or
to
travel only 1 m. This is not how fast “electricity travels”: when you flip a light
switch, the light—even if many meters away—goes on nearly instantaneously.
Why? Because electric fields travel essentially at the speed of light 
We can think of electrons in a wire as being like a pipe full of water: when a little
water enters one end of the pipe, some water immediately comes out the other end.
