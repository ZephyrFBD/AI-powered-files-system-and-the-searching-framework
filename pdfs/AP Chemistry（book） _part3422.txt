uranium sources and potentially reducing radioactive waste. This type of reactor is so 
named because it creates (“breeds”) more fissionable material than it consumes. The 
reactor operates without a moderator, which means the neutrons used are not slowed 
down. In order to capture the fast neutrons, the fuel must be highly enriched with both 
uranium-235 and plutonium-239. Water cannot be used as a primary coolant because it 
would moderate the neutrons, and so a liquid metal, usually sodium, is used. The core 
is surrounded by a blanket of uranium-238 that captures neutrons that escape the core, 
producing plutonium-239 in the process. The plutonium can later be separated by repro-
cessing and used as fuel in a future cycle.
Because fast neutrons are more effective at decaying many radioactive nuclides, the 
material separated from the uranium and plutonium during reprocessing is less radio-
active than waste from other reactors. However, generation of relatively high levels of
