2 and He2, referring to Figures 9.32 and 
9.33. H2 has two bonding electrons and zero antibonding electrons, so it has a bond 
order of 1.
Figure 9.33 shows the energy-level diagram for the hypothetical He2 molecule, which 
requires four electrons to fill its molecular orbitals. Because only two electrons can go in the 
s
1s MO, the other two electrons must go in the s
1s
*  MO. The electron configuration of He2 is 
thus s1s

*2. The energy decrease realized in going from He atomic orbitals to the He bond-
ing MO is offset by the energy increase realized in going from the atomic orbitals to the He 
Antibonding MO occupied
