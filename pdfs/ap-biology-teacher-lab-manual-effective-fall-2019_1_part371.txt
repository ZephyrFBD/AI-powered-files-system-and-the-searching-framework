Step 6 Pour the disks and the solution from the syringe into the appropriate clear plastic 
cup. Disks infiltrated with the bicarbonate solution go in the “With CO2” cup, and disks 
infiltrated with the water go in the “Without CO2” cup. 
Step 7 Place both cups under the light source and start the timer. At the end of each 
minute, record the number of floating disks. Then swirl the disks to dislodge any that 
stuck against the side of the cups. Continue until all of the disks are floating in the cup 
with the bicarbonate solution.

Step 8 To make comparisons between experiments, a standard point of reference is 
needed. Repeated testing of this procedure has shown that the point at which 50% of the 
leaf disks are floating (the median or ET50, the Estimated Time
