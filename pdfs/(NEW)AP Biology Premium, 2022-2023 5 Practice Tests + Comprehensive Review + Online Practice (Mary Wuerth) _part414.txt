NA—This separates the two strands of the double helix. It is usually done at a high
temperature.
2. Annealing of the primers—Once the DNA strands have been separated, the temperature is lowered slightly,
and primers that are complementary to the desired DNA sequence are allowed to anneal (form hydrogen
bonds with) the beginning and end of the fragment of the DNA sequence that is to be amplified.
3. Extension of the primers—DNA polymerase then adds new nucleotides to the primers, creating two copies
of the desired DNA sequence. A heat-stable DNA polymerase is used for this step so that it will not be
denatured during the rise in temperature with each cycle of PCR.
Each cycle of PCR doubles the number of copies of the desired DNA sequence. The number of copies of the
DNA sequence produced at the end of PCR is equal to 2n, where n is the number of cycles of PCR completed. After
just 20 cycles of PCR, over one million copies of the DNA sequence can be generated.
PCR can also be used to rap
