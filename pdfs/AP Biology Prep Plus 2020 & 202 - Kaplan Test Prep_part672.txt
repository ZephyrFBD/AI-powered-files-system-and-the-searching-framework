pagate in unpolluted areas, but resistant
buﬀalo grass does not breed with nonresistant buﬀalo grasses.
Based on these findings, which best describes the resistant
buﬀalo grass populations?
Resistant buﬀalo grass has not undergone speciation
because it is not a distinct geographical population.
(A)
Resistant buﬀalo grass is not a new species of grass because
it has the morphological appearance of neighboring buﬀalo
grasses.
(B)
Resistant buﬀalo grass has undergone speciation because it
is not interbreeding freely with neighboring buﬀalo grasses.
(C)
Resistant buﬀalo grass is a new species of grass because it is
planted next to mines to detoxify the ground.
(D)
5. Fungi, the kingdom that includes mold, yeast, and mushrooms,
was formerly considered a part of the kingdom Plantae, which
includes land plants. Published studies drew a comparison of
base substitutions in actin, a major cytoskeleton protein. A
summary of the data is shown in the table below.
