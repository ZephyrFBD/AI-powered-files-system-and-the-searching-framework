g cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing
them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again.
One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of
a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon,
which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission
occurs is called a synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve
cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues
on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the
cell emitting the signal). The neurotransmitters are transported across the very sm
