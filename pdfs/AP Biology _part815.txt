exploring selection and evolution in the classroom.
Objective
You will carry out an artificial selection with Wisconsin Fast Plants and
try to answer the following question:
“Can extreme selection change the expression of a
quantitative trait in a population in one generation?”
Sprout some Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds. When they are 7–12 days old,
examine them and decide as a class which single trait will be best to try to

alter by artificial selection. The trait must be one that varies within a range,
not an all-or-none trait. The most common trait studied in this experiment
is the number of trichomes, which are hairlike structures on the leaves.
(Trichomes deter predation by herbivores such as the butterfly.)
Backlighting and using a magnifying glass will help you count the tiny
trichomes. Do not count every hair. Instead, use a sampling technique
agreed upon by the class. See Figure 19.2.
