mildly express a variety of
female secondary sex characteristics (for example, reduced facial and chest hair, breast development). Although the
extra X chromosome is mostly inactive (forming a Barr body), some activity apparently remains. An XXX
individual can result when an XX egg combines with a normal X sperm, but these trisomic X females are usually
without serious disorders, though they are often tall and may have some learning disabilities (Figure 8-8).

3. Chromosomal aberrations are caused when chromosome segments are changed.
 
Duplications occur when a chromosome segment is repeated on the same chromosome. For example, Huntingtonâ€™s
disease is caused by the insertion of multiple repeats of three nucleotides. The mutant gene codes for a defective
enzyme, which results in the death of nerve cells in the brain.
Inversions occur when chromosome segments are rearranged in reverse orientation on the same chromosome.
Individuals with inversions usually do not express any ab
