RELEVANT EQUATION
p H = neg ative log [H plus]

ENE-1.G.2
The relative concentrations of substrates 
and products determine how efficiently an 
enzymatic reaction proceeds.
ENE-1.G.3
Higher environmental temperatures increase 
the speed of movement of molecules in a 
solution, increasing the frequency of collisions 
between enzymes and substrates and 
therefore incre
