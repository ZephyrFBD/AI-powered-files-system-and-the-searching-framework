Diffraction sets an ultimate limit on the detail that can be seen on any object.
In Eq. 25–8 for the resolving power of a microscope, the focal length of the lens
cannot practically be made less than (approximately) the radius of the lens (
),
and even that is very difficult (see the lensmaker’s equation, Eq. 23–10). In this
best case, Eq. 25–8 gives, with
(25;9)
Thus we can say, to within a factor of 2 or so, that
it is not possible to resolve detail of objects smaller than the wavelength of
the radiation being used.
This is an important and useful rule of thumb.
Compound lenses in microscopes are now designed so well that the actual
limit on resolution is often set by diffraction—that is, by the wavelength of the
light used. To obtain greater detail, one must use radiation of shorter wavelength.
The use of UV radiation can increase the resolution by a factor of perhaps 2. Far
more important, however, was the discovery in the early twentieth century that
electrons have wave pro
