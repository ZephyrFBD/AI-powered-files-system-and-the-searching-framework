 independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of
alleles into gametes, and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur. The independent
assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express
different traits for two characteristics. Consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that
has green, wrinkled seeds (yyrr) and another that has yellow, round seeds (YYRR). Because each parent is homozygous, the
law of segregation indicates that the gametes for the green/wrinkled plant all are yr, and the gametes for the yellow/round
plant are all YR. Therefore, the F1 generation of offspring all are YyRr (Figure 12.16).
