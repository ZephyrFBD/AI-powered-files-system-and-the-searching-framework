ts (wings, gills, etc.), in this
investigation you will use DNA evidence to establish the similarity among
diﬀerent organisms.
17.3 Investigate evolutionary changes with cladograms
Locating and sequencing genes in diﬀerent organisms not only helps us
to better understand evolutionary relationships among organisms, but it
can also provide important insights into genetic diseases. Species with
smaller genomes, such as the fruit fly and mouse, are easier for scientists
to study than humans. When scientists locate a disease-causing gene in a
fruit fly or mouse, they can then use BLAST to see if there is a similar
sequence in the human genome.
Using BLAST requires several specific steps and an abundance of
information, none of which you need to memorize for the AP Biology
exam. Rather, you should be able to apply similarities and diﬀerences in
morphology and genetics to determine the evolutionary relationships
between diﬀerent species. Drawing and analyzing cladograms (as well as
phylogenet
