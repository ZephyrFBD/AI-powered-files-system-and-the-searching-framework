▲ Figure 20.23 Energy densities of various types of batteries. 
The higher the volumetric energy density, the smaller the 
amount of space needed for the batteries. The higher the 
specific energy density, the smaller the mass of the batteries.  
A Watt-hour (W-h) is equivalent to 3.6 * 103 Joules.
