itals that is essentially fully occupied by electrons. 
(Section 12.7)
valence-bond theory A model of chemical bonding in which an 
electron-pair bond is formed between two atoms by the overlap 
of orbitals on the two atoms. (Section 9.4)
valence electrons The outermost electrons of an atom; those 
that occupy orbitals not occupied in the nearest noble-gas 
element of lower atomic number. The valence electrons are the 
ones the atom uses in bonding. (Section 6.8)
valence orbitals Orbitals that contain the outer-shell electrons 
of an atom. (Chapter 7: Introduction)
valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model A model 
that accounts for the geometric arrangements of shared and 
unshared electron pairs around a central atom in terms of the 
repulsions between electron pairs. (Sections 9.1 and 9.2)
van der Waals equation An equation of state for nonideal gases 
that is based on adding corrections to the ideal-gas equation. 
The correction terms account for intermolecular forces of
