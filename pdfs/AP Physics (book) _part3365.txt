are isotopes
that lie above the stable isotopes plotted in Fig. 30–2. But what about unstable
isotopes that have too few neutrons compared to their number of protons—
those that fall below the stable isotopes of Fig. 30–2? These, it turns out, decay by
emitting a positron instead of an electron. A positron (sometimes called an 
or
particle) has the same mass as the electron, but it has a positive charge of 
Because it is so like an electron, except for its charge, the positron is called the
antiparticle† to the electron. An example of a 
decay is that of 
where 
stands for a positron. Note that the 
emitted here is a neutrino,
whereas that emitted in 
decay is called an antineutrino. Thus an antielectron
is emitted with a neutrino, whereas an antineutrino is emitted with
an electron; this gives a certain balance as discussed in Chapter 32.
We can write 
and 
decay, in general, as follows:
where N is the parent nucleus and 
is the daughter.
