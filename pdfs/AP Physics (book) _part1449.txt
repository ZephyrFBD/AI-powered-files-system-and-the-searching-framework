substances, however, can exist in several forms in the solid phase. A transition
from one phase to another occurs at a particular temperature and pressure, just
like ordinary phase changes. For example, ice has been observed in at least eight
forms at very high pressure. Ordinary helium has two distinct liquid phases, called
helium I and II. They exist only at temperatures within a few degrees of absolute
zero. Helium II exhibits very unusual properties referred to as superfluidity.
It has essentially zero viscosity and exhibits strange properties such as climbing
up the sides of an open container. Also interesting are liquid crystals (used for
computer and TV monitors, Section 24–11) which can be considered to be in a
phase between liquid and solid.

If a glass of water is left out overnight, the water level will have dropped by morning.
We say the water has evaporated, meaning that som
