is sometimes called the pressure head. In this Example,
the head of water is 30 m at the faucet. The very different diameters of the tank
and faucet don’t affect the result—only height does.

EXERCISE B A dam holds back a lake that is 85 m deep at the dam. If the lake is 20 km
long, how much thicker should the dam be than if the lake were smaller, only 1.0 km long?
10–4 Atmospheric Pressure 
and Gauge Pressure
Atmospheric Pressure
The pressure of the Earth’s atmosphere, as in any fluid, changes with depth. But
the Earth’s atmosphere is somewhat complicated: not only does the density of air
vary greatly with altitude but there is no distinct top surface to the atmosphere
from which h (in Eq. 10–3a) could be measured. We can, however, calculate the
approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes above Earth’s surface
using Eq. 10–3b.
The pressure of the air at a given place varie
