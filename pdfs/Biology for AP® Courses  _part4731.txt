ical ecosystems may promote speciation
by increasing the heterogeneity, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes. The greater
heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading
to population differentiation. However, this hypothesis suffers from some circularityâ€”ecosystems with more species
encourage speciation, but how did they get more species to begin with? The tropics have been perceived as being more
stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality. The tropics have their own
forms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might
promote speciation.
Regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics. Additionally, the
