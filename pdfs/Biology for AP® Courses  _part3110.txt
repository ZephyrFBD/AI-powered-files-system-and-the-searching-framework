 of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons.
Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons
transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract. Without its sensory-
somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels,
hears, and so on) and could not control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which has two synapses
between the CNS and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons have only one synapseâ€”one ending of the neuron is
at the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron. Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these
synapses.
Humans have 12 cranial nerves, nerves that emerge from or enter the skull (cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves,
which emerge from the vertebral column. Each cranial nerve is accorded a name, which are d
