nd in the future, since it is passed on from cell to cell in somatic cells and from parent to offspring.
If the mistake occurs in a germline cell, that will become a gamete. Mistakes in DNA can last forever.
It is important to know that just having an error in the DNA is not a problem unless that gene is expressed AND the
error causes a change in the gene product (RNA or protein). Think of it like an error in a recipe in a cookbook: an
error wonâ€™t harm anyone unless the recipe is actually made AND the error causes a big change in the recipe. As we
will see, a mutation can cause different types of effects. Often, the result will be a change to the gene product
(protein) and the phenotype of the individual caused by that protein. This can be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to
the individual depending on the specific mutation that occurs and the environmental context. Mutations are the
primary source of genetic variation.
