ts approximately 10 years,
with the predator population lagging 1â€“2 years behind that of the prey population. As the hare numbers increase, there is
more food available for the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. When the lynx population grows to a
threshold level, however, they kill so many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx
population because of scarcity of food. When the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at
least in part, to low predation pressure, starting the cycle anew.
Figure 36.19 The cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare populations in Northern Ontario is an example of predator-prey
dynamics.
The idea that the population cycling of the two species is entirely controlled by predation models has come under question.
More recent studies have pointed to undefined density-dependent factors as being important in the cycling, in addition to
predation. One possibility is that the cyclin
