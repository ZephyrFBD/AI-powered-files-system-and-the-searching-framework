stacked inside. Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix
measures 3.4 nm. Therefore, ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix. The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2
nm, and it is uniform throughout. Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter. The
twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves (Figure
14.7).
Figure 14.7 DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) phosphodiester bonds. The (c) major and minor grooves
are binding sites for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and
replication.
