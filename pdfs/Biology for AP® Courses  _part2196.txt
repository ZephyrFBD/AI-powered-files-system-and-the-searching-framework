s a good practice.
a.
A breeder would not allow close relatives to
mate because inbreeding increases the likelihood
of fatal mutations in offspring.
b.
A breeder would not allow close relatives to
mate because inbreeding prevents gene flow
which can bring new, successful genes into the
population.
c.
A breeder would not allow close relatives to
mate because inbreeding causes diversifying
selection, which dilutes the breederâ€™s desired
genes in the population.
d.
A breeder would not allow close relatives to
mate because inbreeding can bring together
deleterious recessive mutations that can cause
abnormalities and susceptibility to disease.

a.
The founder effect is an event that isolates part
of a population, generating an allele frequency
which is not typical of the original population.
