roduced as a waste product. The ratio of
carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient (RQ). RQ varies between 0.7 and 1.0. If just
glucose were used to fuel the body, the RQ would equal one. One mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole
of oxygen consumed. Glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body. Protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body.

Because of this, less carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the RQ is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and
about 0.8 for protein.
The RQ is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, the alveolar PO2 Above,
the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm Hg. However, lungs never fully deflate with an
exhalation; therefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the
alveoli. This means that there is a lower
