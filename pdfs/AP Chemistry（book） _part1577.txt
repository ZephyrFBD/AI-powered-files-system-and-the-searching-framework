The ideal-gas equation accounts adequately for the properties of most gases under 
a variety of circumstances. The equation is not exactly correct, however, for any real gas. 
Thus, the measured volume for given values of P, n, and T might differ from the volume 
calculated from PV = nRT (Figure 10.9). Although real gases do not always behave ide-
ally, their behavior differs so little from ideal behavior that we can ignore any deviations 
for all but the most accurate work.

Calcium carbonate, CaCO31s2, the principal compound in limestone, decomposes upon heating to CaO(s) and CO21g2. A sample 
of CaCO3 is decomposed, and the carbon dioxide is collected in a 250-mL flask. After decomposition is complete, the gas has a 
pressure of 1.3 atm at a temperature of 31 °C. How many moles of CO2 gas were generated?
