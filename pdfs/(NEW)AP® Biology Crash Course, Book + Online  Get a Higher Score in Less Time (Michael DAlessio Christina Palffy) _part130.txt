. Population—a group of individuals in the same geographical area that belong to the same species and
are capable of interbreeding.
2. Gene Pool—the total sum of alleles within a population at a given time.
B. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium—a model for the study of the gene pool of a nonevolving population.
1. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium indicates that the frequencies of two alleles do not change from
generation to generation; a population is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium if the following
five conditions are met:
i.
A very large population sample
ii. No migration of individuals into or out of the population
iii. No mutation
iv. No natural selection
v. Random mating
Note: These conditions are rarely met, but they provide a theoretical basis to test against.
2. To determine if a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies must remain
constant over generations. To determine allele frequencies, use the following equation.
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
p2 = frequency of AA
q2
