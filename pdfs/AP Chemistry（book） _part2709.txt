OH to 1.000 L  
of pure water, we ﬁrst determine the con-
centration of OH- ions in solution:
3OH-4 = 0.020 mol>1.005 L = 0.020 M
 
We use this value in Equation 16.18 to 
calculate pOH and then use our calcu-
lated pOH value to obtain pH:
 pOH = -log3OH-4 = -log10.0202 = +1.70
 pH = 14 - 1+1.702 = 12.30

Chemical reactions that occur in living systems are often extremely 
sensitive to pH. Many of the enzymes that catalyze important bio-
chemical reactions are effective only within a narrow pH range. For 
this reason, the human body maintains a remarkably intricate sys-
tem of buffers, both within cells and in the ﬂuids that transport ce
