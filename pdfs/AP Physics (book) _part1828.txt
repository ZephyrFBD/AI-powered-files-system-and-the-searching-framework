64. What is the total charge of all the electrons in a 25-kg bar
of aluminum? (Aluminum has 13 electrons per atom and an
atomic mass of 27 u.)
65. Two point charges,
and 
of mass m, are placed on
the ends of a massless rod of length 
which is fixed to a
table by a pin through its center. If the apparatus is then
subjected to a uniform electric field E parallel to the table
and perpendicular to the rod, find the net torque on the
system of rod plus charges.
66. Determine the direction and magnitude of the electric field at
point P, Fig. 16–69. The two charges are separated by a dis-
tance of 2a. Point P is on the perpendicular bisector of the line
joining the charges, a distance x from the midpoint between
them. Express your
answers in terms of
Q, x, a, and k.
