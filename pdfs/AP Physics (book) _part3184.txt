The slight difference in energy (0.05 eV) is supplied by the kinetic energy of the
moving atoms. In this manner, the 
state in Ne—which is metastable—becomes
more populated than the 
level. This inverted population between 
and 
is what is needed for lasing.
Very common now are semiconductor diode lasers, also called pn junction
lasers, which utilize an inverted population of electrons between the conduction
band and the lower-energy valence band (Section 29–9). When an electron jumps
down, a photon can be emitted, which in turn can stimulate another electron to
make the transition and emit another photon, in phase. The needed mirrors (as in
Fig. 28–18) are made by the polished ends of the pn crystal. Semiconductor lasers
are used in CD and DVD players (see below), and in many other applications.
Other types of laser include: chemical lasers, in which the energy input comes
from the chemical reaction of highly reactive gases; dye lasers, whose frequency 
is tunable;
gas lasers, capable
