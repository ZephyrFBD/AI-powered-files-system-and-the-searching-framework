he springs are underdamped. (See 
Sections 11–3 and 11–5.)
2. A particular unbalanced wheel of a car shakes when the car
moves at 
The wheel plus tire has mass 17.0 kg
and diameter 0.58 m. By how much will the springs of this
car compress when it is loaded with 280 kg? (Assume the
280 kg is split evenly among all four springs, which are iden-
tical.) [Hint: Reread Sections 11–1, 11–3, 11–6, and 8–3.]
3. Sometimes a car develops a pronounced rattle or vibration
at a particular speed, especially if the road is hot enough
that the tar between concrete slabs bumps up at regularly
spaced intervals. Reread Sections 11–5 and 11–6, and
decide whether each of the following is a factor and, if so,
how: underdamping, overdamping, critical damping, and
forced resonance.
4. Destructive interference occurs where two overlapping
waves are wavelength or 180° out of phase. Explain why
180° is equivalent to wavelength.
5. Estimate the effective spring constant of a trampoline.
