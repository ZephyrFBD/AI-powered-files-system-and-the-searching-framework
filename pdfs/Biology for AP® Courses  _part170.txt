led chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.
This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer. As Figure 2.11 illustrates,
sodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron
than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11
neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl)
in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient
for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons,
17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (â€“1) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example,
sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shel
