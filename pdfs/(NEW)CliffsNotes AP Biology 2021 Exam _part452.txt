elective value to some specific feature of the environment than other forms. In some cases, the
adaptation may also create an isolating mechanism. For example, in response to seed size, a population consists of
birds with large and small beaks. In addition, the beak size influences bird song expression, which results in
segregated mating behavior, and ultimately, reproductive isolation.
c. Adaptive radiation occurs when a population is introduced to an area where many geographic or ecological
conditions are available. When the introduced species enters the various new habitats, selection pressures will vary
with habitat. For example, in colder habitats, larger animals may be favored (for insulation). In a habitat with many
fruitproducing plants, fruit-eating abilities among the animals may be favored. Adaptive radiation occurs among
plants as well. For example, in a rain forest habitat, individual plants that have adaptations to wet conditions are
favored, whereas in dry regions, plant
