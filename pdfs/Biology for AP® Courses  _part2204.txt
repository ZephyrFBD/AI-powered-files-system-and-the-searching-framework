genetic drift in population B.
b.
In population A, natural selection is likely
occurring, with allele A being favored over
allele B. In population B, gene flow apparently
occurred, allowing allele A to become
established in population B. Allele A also
appears to be favored by selection in population
B.
c.
In population A, gene flow apparently occurred,
allowing allele B to become established in
population A. Allele A also appears to be
favored by selection in population A. In
population B genetic drift is likely occurring,
causing allele A to become more prevalent than
allele B.
d.
In population A, mutation apparently occurred,
introducing allele B to population A. Allele A
also appears to be increasing due to genetic drift
in population A. In population B natural
selection is likely occurring, with allele A being
favored over allele B.

the years, he recorded the date of flowering from the
mown field as well as a similar grass fi
