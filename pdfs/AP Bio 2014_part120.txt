nding of triplet code
in production of polypeptide.
• Response demonstrates
understanding of the role of
the start and stop codons in
production of polypeptides
from which the initial
methionione is excised.

Question 2 (continued) 
 
Reasoning (2 points) 
• 
RNA is modified or processed. 
• 
Introns are removed from mRNA but remain in the gene structure. 
• 
5’ cap adds a nucleotide that is not encoded by the gene. 
• 
PolyA tail adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of the mRNA that are not encoded by the gene. 
• 
The gene has regulatory sequences (promoters/enhancers) that are not transcribed. 
• 
Alternative splicing mixes different exons 
 
(c) One genetic change associated with the disorder results in a methionine-to-valine substitution  
at amino acid position 425 of the encoded polypeptide, as shown in Figure 1. Using the codon table
