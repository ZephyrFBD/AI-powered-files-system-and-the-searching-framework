1. (I) Calculate the terminal voltage for a battery with an
internal resistance of 
and an emf of 6.00 V when
the battery is connected in series with (a) a 
resistor,
and (b) a 
resistor.
2. (I) Four 1.50-V cells are connected in series to a 
light-
bulb. If the resulting current is 0.45 A, what is the internal
resistance of each cell, assuming they are identical and
neglecting t
