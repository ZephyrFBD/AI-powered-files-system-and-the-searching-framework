 to get 
 
 out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it.You 
 
 can’t be getting something for nothing, isn’t that right?

 I would. 
 
 Well, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want 
 
 you to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under

 Shannon,a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. 
 
 I climb up and under the bed there’s the plain white chamber pot 
 
 streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently 
 
 at the edge of the loft so that it won’t spill, climb down to the chair, 
 
 reach for the chamber pot, bring it do
