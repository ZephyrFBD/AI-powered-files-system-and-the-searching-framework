ow-growing fishes that, in the Caribbean, includes a number of species that are at risk
of extinction from overfishing.
Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face peril from several processes. Reefs are home to 1/3 of the
world’s marine fish species—about 4,000 species—despite making up only 1 percent of marine habitat. Most home marine
aquaria are stocked with wild-caught organisms, not cultured organisms. Although no species is known to have been driven
extinct by the pet trade in marine species, there are studies showing that populations of some species have declined in
response to harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at those levels. There are concerns about the effect of
the pet trade on some terrestrial species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutan.
