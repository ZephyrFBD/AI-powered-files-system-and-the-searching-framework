heat. This heat can be used 
by endothermic organisms to regulate 
body temperature.

ENE-1.L
Explain how cells obtain 
energy from biological 
macromolecules in order to 
power cellular functions.
ENE-1.L.1
Glycolysis is a biochemical pathway that 
releases energy in glucose to form ATP from 
ADP and inorganic phosphate, NADH from 
NAD+, and pyruvate.
ENE-1.L.2
Pyruvate is transported from the cytosol to the 
mitochondrion, where further oxidation occurs.
ENE-1.L.3
In the Krebs cycle, carbon dioxide is released 
from organic intermediates, ATP is synthesized 
from ADP and inorganic phosphate, and 
electrons are transferred to the coenzymes 
NADH and FADH2.
ENE-1.L.4
Electrons extracted in glycolysis and Krebs 
cycle reactions are transferred by NADH and 
FADH2 to the electron transport chain in the 
inner mitochondrial membrane.
