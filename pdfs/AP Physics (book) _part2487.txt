where 
and 
are the peak values of the electric and magnetic
fields, respectively, in the wave.
EM waves carry momentum and exert a radiation pressure
proportional to the intensity I of the wave.
Radio, TV, cell phone, and other wireless signals are trans-
mitted through space in the radio-wave or microwave part of
the EM spectrum.

Produced by Changing 
*1. (II) Determine the rate at which the electric field changes
between the round plates of a capacitor, 8.0 cm in diameter,
if the plates are spaced 1.1 mm apart and the voltage across
them is changing at a rate of 
*2. (II) Calculate the displacement current 
between the
square plates, 5.8 cm on a side, of a capacitor if the electric
field is changing at a rate of 
*3. (II) At a given instant, a 3.8-A current flows in the wires
connected to a parallel-plate capacitor. What is the rate at
which the electric field is changing
