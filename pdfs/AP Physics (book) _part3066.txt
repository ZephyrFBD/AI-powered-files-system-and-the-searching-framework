APPROACH Maximum wavelength corresponds to minimum energy, and this
would be the jump from the ground state up to the first excited state
(Fig. 27–29). The next smaller wavelength occurs for the jump from the ground
state to the second excited state.
SOLUTION The energy needed to jump from the ground state to the first excited
state is
the required wavelength, as we saw in
Example 27–13, is 122 nm. The energy to jump from the ground state to the second
excited state is 
which corresponds to a wavelength
