; the movement of water through 
membranes is called osmosis. Like solutes, water moves down its concentration 
gradient. Water moves from areas of high potential (high free water concentration) 
and low solute concentration to areas of low potential (low free water concentration) 
and high solute concentration. Solutes decrease the concentration of free water, since 
water molecules surround the solute molecules. The terms hypertonic, hypotonic, and 
isotonic are used to describe solutions separated by selectively permeable membranes. 
A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration and a lower water potential 
as compared to the other solution; therefore, water will move into the hypertonic 
solution through the membrane by osmosis. A hypotonic solution has a lower solute 
concentration and a higher water potential than the solution on the other side of the 
membrane; water will move down its concentration gradient into the other solution. 
Isotonic solutions have equal water
