the water molecule and
surrounding molecules.
Water’s role as a solvent is another reason it is so important for living
things. Chemicals that are dissolved by the water in blood can be carried
around the body rapidly and easily; this is how sugar gets to muscles, for
example. Each living cell is, in large part, a membrane surrounding
chemicals dissolved in water. It is only by being dissolved in water that
these chemicals can participate in many of the biological reactions that
keep living things alive.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Remember that many organic compounds are nonpolar or have
nonpolar regions and won’t mix with water. Such nonpolar
regions are consequently called hydrophobic (literally
meaning “water-fearing”), while polar and ionic parts of
molecules are hydrophilic (“water-loving”).
Biological Monomers and Polymers
While water molecules contribute to the majority of a cell’s total mass,
the majority of a cell’s dry mass consists of four classes of biological
macromolecules: carbohydr
