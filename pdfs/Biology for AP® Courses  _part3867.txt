tial fluid. Osmolality in the
limb increases, and it is higher inside the loop
than in the interstitial fluid. As the filtrate enters
the ascending limb, Na+ and Cl- ions exit
through ion channels present in the cell
membrane. Further up, sodium is actively
transported out of the filtrate, and chlorine ions
follows.
35. Why might specialized organs have evolved for
excretion of wastes?
a.
Specialized organs have evolved to provide a
measure of safety for organisms.
b.
Specialized organs have evolved to distinguish
different types of organisms.
c.
Specialized organs have evolved for excretion of
wastes to conserve metabolic energy.
d.
Specialized organs have evolved for excretion of
wastes so that organisms can survive in adverse
conditions.
36. Explain two different excretory systems other than the
kidneys.
a.
(1) An excretory mechanism occurs in annelids
through the Malpighian tubules. Metabolic
wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the
tubules. Uric acid is excreted as a thick pa
