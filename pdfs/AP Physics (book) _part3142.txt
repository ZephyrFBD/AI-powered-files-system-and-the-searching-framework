ted (or absorbed) when an electron makes a transition from one state to
another. But quantum mechanics is a much deeper theory, and has provided us
with a very different view of the atom. According to quantum mechanics, electrons
do not exist in well-defined circular orbits as in the Bohr model. Rather, the 
electron (because of its wave nature) can be thought of as spread out in space as
a “cloud.” The size and shape of the electron cloud can be calculated for a given
state of an atom. For the ground state in the hydrogen atom, the electron cloud 
is spherically symmetric, as shown in Fig. 28–6. The electron cloud at its higher
densities roughly indicates the “size” of an atom. But just as a cloud may not 
have a distinct border, atoms do not have a precise boundary or a well-defined
size. Not all electron clouds have a spherical shape, as we shall see later in this
Chapter.
The electron cloud can be interpreted from either the particle or the wave
viewpoint. Remember that by a partic
