f yolk in the eggs. In placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the
motherâ€™s body, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage. Other species, such as birds,
with a lot of yolk in the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage.
In mammals, the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development. Here the cells in the blastula arrange
themselves in two layers: the inner cell mass, and an outer layer called the trophoblast. The inner cell mass is also known
as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo. At this stage of development, illustrated in Figure
34.22 the inner cell mass consists of embryonic stem cells that will differentiate into the different cell types needed by the
organism. The trophoblast will contribute to the placenta and nourish the embryo.
