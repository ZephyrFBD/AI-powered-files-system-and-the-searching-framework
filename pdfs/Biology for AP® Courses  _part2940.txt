 the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters between the rectum and anus
control elimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.
Accessory Organs
The organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. Accessory organs are organs
that add secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the
pancreas, and the gallbladder. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to the food

The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying

The pancreas is another important gland that secret
