60. Which radioactive isotope of lead is being produced if the
measured activity of a sample drops to 1.050% of its origi-
nal activity in 4.00 h?
61. An old wooden tool is found to contain only 4.5% of the
that an equal mass of fresh wood would. How old is
the tool?
62. A neutron star consists of neutrons at approximately
nuclear density. Estimate, for a 10-km-diameter neutron
star, (a) its mass number, (b) its mass (kg), and (c) the
acceleration of gravity at its surface.
63. Tritium dating. The 
isotope of hydrogen, which is
called tritium (because it contains three nucleons), has a
half-life of 12.3 yr. It can be used to measure the age of
objects up to about 100 yr. It is produced in the upper
atmosphere by cosmic rays and brought to Earth by rain.
As an application, determine approximately the age of a
bottle of wine whose 
radiation is about 
that present
in new wine.
64. Some elementary particle theories (Section 32â€“11) suggest
that the proton may be un
