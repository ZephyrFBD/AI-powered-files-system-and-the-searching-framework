togenesis in females begins with an oogonium and ends with a single, viable egg and three nonfunctional polar
bodies. By producing a single egg, most of the nutrients and cytoplasmic organelles are retained for the potential
embryo. In males, each spermatogonium divides to produce four viable sperm, each containing an equal amount of
cytoplasm. Gametogenesis in females begins during embryonic development, stops at prophase I at birth, and begins
again at puberty, releasing one egg a month until menopause. In males, gametogenesis begins at puberty and
continues without interruption. In contrast to males, the female reproductive cycle also regulates the menstrual cycle,
the thickening and sloughing off of the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus). As a result, the system of
feedback loops is more complex in females than in males.
Question 2
Low levels of estrogen signal the beginning of the menstrual cycle by triggering a negative feedback response. The
