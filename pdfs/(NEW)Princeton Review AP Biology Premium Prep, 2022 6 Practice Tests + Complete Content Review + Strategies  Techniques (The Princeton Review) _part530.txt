pindles attach only to kinetochore protein complexes at the
centromere. Therefore, (D) is the answer.
5.
B
Both (A) and (B) have sperm or ovum as the first type of cell. Because these are both gametes, they will
both have half of the DNA of other types of cells. Choices (C) and (D) can thus be eliminated. Muscles
and neurons are both terminally differentiated in G0 arrest. However, liver and taste buds potentially
differ. Although liver cells can divide, taste buds divide at a higher rate, so they are most likely to be in
G2 phase. Therefore, the answer is (B).
6.
A
Nondisjunction results in major changes to the genome, so (B) and (C) can be eliminated. Deletion of an
enhancer, (D), could affect the gene expression and then phenotype. However, in (A), translocation may
not produce any effect, as the same information exists in the genome.

D
The father and mother are both AB blood type. Since neither parent has a recessive allele, it is impossible
for their c
