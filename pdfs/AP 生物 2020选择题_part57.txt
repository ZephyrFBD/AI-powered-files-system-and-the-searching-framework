 2pq + q2 = 1 
p = frequency of allele 1 in a 
population 
p + q = 1 
q = frequency of allele 2 in a 
population 
x = sample mean  
n = sample size 
s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-based 
estimate of the standard deviation of the 
population)  
o = observed results
e 
 = expected results 
 = sum of all 
Degrees of freedom are 
 equal to the number of 
  
distinct possible outcomes minus one.

Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set 
 
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set 
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points 
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum)
