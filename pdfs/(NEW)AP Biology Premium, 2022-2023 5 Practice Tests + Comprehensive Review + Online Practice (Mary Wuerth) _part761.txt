art at the mean of the data set, and then subtract two times the standard error of the mean.
Chi-Square
The chi-square formula is appropriate for evaluating a null hypothesis about a data set that involves counts (for
example, whether or not the observed numbers of cells in different phases of the cell cycle are significantly different
from the expected numbers). The formula for chi-square is:
Once the chi-square value for a data set is calculated, it is compared to the critical value found in the chi-square
table. Find the critical value at the intersection of the degrees of freedom (df) and the p-value.
Genetics Problems and Laws of Probability
When working through genetics problems, it is useful to understand the basic laws of probability.
If the results of one event do not affect the results of a second event (independent events), the probability of both
events happening equals the product of their individual probabilities:
For example, if the probability of a tall plant is  and th
