mal allele is dominant) but will be carriers of the disease. Males, on the
other hand, inherit only one X chromosome and, thus, only one copy of the allele. If they receive the normal allele,
they will have normal clotting; if they receive the hemophilia allele, they will be hemophiliacs. Because they need
only one copy of the allele to express the trait, sex-linked diseases are more common in males than in females.
e. Down syndrome occurs as a result of the nondisjunction of the two number 21 chromosomes. As a result, the
homologous pair does not separate and move to opposite poles (as the law of segregation implies), but rather both
chromosomes end up at the same pole and in the same gamete. Two kinds of gametes are formed, one with two
copies of chromosome 21 and one with no chromosome 21. Only the gamete with two copies of the chromosome is
viable. The zygote formed between this gamete and a normal gamete will have three copies of chromosome 21, and
the infant will express the Down
