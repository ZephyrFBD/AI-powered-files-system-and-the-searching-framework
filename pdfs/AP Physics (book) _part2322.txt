nuous slip ring that rotates with the armature.) After one-half
revolution, wire b will be where wire a is now in Fig. 21–14, and the current then
at brush b will be inward. Thus the current produced is alternating.
The frequency f is 60 Hz for general use in the United States and Canada,
whereas 50 Hz is used in many countries. Most of the power generated in the
United States is done at steam plants, where the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil,
natural gas) boils water to produce high-pressure steam that turns a turbine
connected to the generator axle (Fig. 15–21). Turbines can also be turned by
water pressure at a dam (hydroelectric). At nuclear power plants, the nuclear
energy released is used to produce steam to turn turbines. Indeed, a heat engine
(Chapter 15) connected to a generator is the principal means of generating
electric power. The frequency of 60 Hz or 50 Hz is maintained very precisely by
power companies.
A dc generator is much like an ac generator, except the slip rin
