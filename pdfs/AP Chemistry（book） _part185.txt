t the result as 104.8 because 83.1 has only one decimal place.
2. For multiplication and division, the result contains the same number of significant 
 
figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures. When the result 
 
contains more than the correct number of significant figures, it must be rounded 
off. For example, the area of a rectangle whose measured edge lengths are 6.221 and 
5.2 cm should be reported with two significant figures, 32 cm2, even though a calculator 
shows the product to have more digits:
Area = 16.221 cm215.2 cm2 = 32.3492 cm2 1 round off to 32 cm2
because 5.2 has two significant figures.
In determining the final answer for a calculated quantity, exact numbers are assumed to 
have an infinite number of significant figures. Thus, when we say, “There are 12 inches in 1 foot,” 
 
the number 12 is exact, and we need not worry about the number of significant figures in it.
When rounding off numbers look at the leftmost digit to be removed:
