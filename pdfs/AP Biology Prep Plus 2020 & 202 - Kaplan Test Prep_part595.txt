same hive. A
researcher finds that bee morphology is driven by an external
chemical signal. Based on this finding, which of the following
hypotheses would be the most appropriate to test next?
Diﬀerences in incubation temperature during development
aﬀect which genes are expressed.
(A)
Diﬀerences in diet during larval development aﬀect which
genes are expressed.
(B)
The number of mutations in the coding DNA regions of
queens versus workers aﬀect which genes are expressed.
(C)
The diﬀerences in the ways that queens, workers, and drones
use their hindlimbs aﬀect which genes are expressed.
(D)
2. Lymnaea stagnalis snails usually have right-coiling shells, and leȇ-
coiling shells are rare. Studies have shown that the allele for a
right-coiling shell is dominant to the allele for a leȇ-coiling shell. A
cross between a true-breeding leȇ-coiling female snail and a
homozygous right-coiling male snail produces entirely leȇ-coiling
oﬀspring. However, a cross between a right-coiling female and a
