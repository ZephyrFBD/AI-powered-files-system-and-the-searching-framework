Sample Exercise 14.2
 Calculating an Instantaneous Rate of Reaction
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine an instantaneous rate from a 
graph of reactant concentration versus time.
Plan To obtain the instantaneous rate at t = 0 s, we must deter-
mine the slope of the curve at t = 0. The tangent is drawn on 
the graph as the hypotenuse of the tan triangle. The slope of this 
straight line equals the change in the vertical axis divided by the 
corresponding change in the horizontal axis (which, in the case of 
this example, is the change in molarity over change in time).
Solve The tangent line falls from 3C4H9Cl4 = 0.100 M to 0.060 M 
in the time change from 0 s to 210 s. Thus, the initial rate is
Rate = -  
∆3C4H9Cl4
∆t
= -  
10.060 - 0.1002 M
1210 - 02 s
= 1.9 * 10-4 M>s
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following could be the instantaneous rate of 
the reaction in Figure 14.3 at t = 1000 s?
(a) 1.2 * 10-4 M>s 
(b) 8.8 * 10-5 M>s
(c) 6.3 * 10-5 M>s 
(d) 2.7 * 10-5 M>s
(e) More t
