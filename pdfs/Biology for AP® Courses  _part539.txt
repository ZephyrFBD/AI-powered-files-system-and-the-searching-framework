Proteins
Proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins (some specialized types are called
integrins) are, as their name suggests, integrated completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membrane-
spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer (Figure 5.2). Single-pass integral
membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20–25 amino acids. Some span
only part of the membrane—associating with a single layer—while others stretch from one side of the membrane to the
other, and are exposed on either side. Some complex proteins are composed of up to 12 segments of a single protein, whi
