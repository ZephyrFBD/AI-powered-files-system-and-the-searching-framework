Question 63
Essential Knowledge
3.B.2: A variety of intercellular and intracellular signal 
transmissions mediate gene expression.
Science Practice
1.4: The student can use representations and models  
to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively  
and quantitatively.
Learning Objective 
3.23: The student can use representations to describe 
mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression.
(A)
This option is incorrect because creating a molecule similar to the Hedgehog 
protein and activating Ptc will amplify the signaling pathway, possibly creating 
more pancreatic cancer cells.
(B)
This option is incorrect because there is no indication or data in the information
