otosynthetic prokaryote that invaded
the precursor of the eukaryotic cell. In this arrangement, the chloroplast
precursor cell provided food and received protection. Photosynthetic
prokaryotes today carry out photosynthesis in a manner similar to the
chloroplast.
Vacuoles are membrane-enclosed sacs within the cell. Many types of
cells have vacuoles, but plant vacuoles are particularly large, taking up 90
percent of the cell volume in some cases. Plants use the vacuole to store
waste products, and the pressure of liquid and solutes in the vacuole
helps the plant to maintain stiï¬€ness and structure as well.
All plant cells have a cellulose cell wall that distinguishes them from
animal cells, which lack a cell wall. The cell wall of plants is also distinct
from the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria and the chitin cell wall of
fungi. The cell wall provides structure and strength to plants.

Cilia and flagella are both anchored into the cell membrane by
