lar their biochemistry is. Humans and mice are both mammals.
This close relationship is the reason that medical researchers can test new
medicines on mice and extrapolate the results to humans. The protein
cytochrome c is one of several electron carriers in the electron transport
chain in cellular respiration and photosynthesis. It is present in all aerobic
organisms. Analysis of its amino acid sequence is used to determine
ancestral relationships and build cladograms. The amino acid sequence of
cytochrome c in humans and chimps is almost identical.
4. Comparative Embryology
Closely related organisms go through similar stages in their embryonic
development. For example, all vertebrate embryos go through a stage in

which they have gill pouches on the sides of their throats. In fish, the gill
pouches develop into gills. In mammals, they develop into eustachian
tubes in the ears.
5. Molecular Biology
Since all aerobic organisms contain cells th
