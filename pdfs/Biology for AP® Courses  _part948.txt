 captures the energy to reduce NADP+ into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee
that the production of NADPH will roughly equal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to
exactly match the chloroplastâ€™s constantly changing energy needs.
Generating an Energy Carrier: ATP
As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the
thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the
thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of
cellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge,
repelling each other.
To release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the
thylakoid, that opening is a passag
