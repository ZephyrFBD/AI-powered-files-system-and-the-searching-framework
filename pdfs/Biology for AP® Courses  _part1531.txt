 5' to 3'
direction, which poses a slight problem at the replication fork. As we know, the DNA double helix is anti-parallel; that is,
one strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. One strand, which is complementary
to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can
add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand,
complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as
Okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist
who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.
The leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the
short Okazaki fragments. The overall di
