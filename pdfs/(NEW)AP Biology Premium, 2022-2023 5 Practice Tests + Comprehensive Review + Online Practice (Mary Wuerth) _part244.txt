ose from their environment. Four different cell types (A, B, C, and D) are used. At the start of this
experiment, there are eight Petri dishes, each of which contains 100 millimolar glucose solution. Two dishes
each contain cell type A, two dishes contain cell type B, two dishes contain cell type C, and the final two dishes
contain cell type D, as illustrated in the following figure.
The hormone is added to four of the Petri dishes, one of each cell type. Glucose levels are measured in all eight
Petri dishes 30 minutes after the addition of the hormone, and those glucose levels are listed in the following
table.
(a) Describe the most likely reason why cell types C and D did not respond to the presence of the hormone.
(b) Identify the function of Petri dishes 1, 3, 5, and 7 in the experimental procedure.
(c) A molecule is added to Petri dish 4 before the hormone is added. This molecule irreversibly binds to this
hormone, preventing the hormone from binding to any receptor. The hormone i
