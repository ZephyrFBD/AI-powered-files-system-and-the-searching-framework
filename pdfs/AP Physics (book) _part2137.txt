3. A 
resistor is placed in series with a 
resistor.
The current in the 
resistor is 10 A. If the resistors
are swapped, how much current flows through the 
resistor?
(a)
(b) 
(c) 10 A.
(d) Need more information about the circuit.
4. Two identical 10-V batteries and two identical 
resis-
tors are placed in series as shown in Fig. 19–42. If a 
lightbulb is connected with one end connected between
the batteries and other end between the resistors, how
much current will flow thro
