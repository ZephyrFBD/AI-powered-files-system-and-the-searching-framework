r completeness:
a gravitational redshift. Light leaving a massive star is gaining in gravitational
potential energy (just like a stone thrown upward from Earth). So the kinetic
energy of each photon, hf, must be getting smaller (to conserve energy). A smaller
frequency f means a larger (longer) wavelength 
which is a redshift.
The amount of a redshift is specified by the redshift parameter, z, defined as
(33;5a)
where 
is a wavelength as seen by an observer at rest relative to the source,
and 
is the wavelength measured by a moving observer. Equation 33–5a can
be written as
(33;5b)
and
(33;5c)
For low speeds not close to the speed of light 
, the Doppler formula
(Eq. 33–3) can be used to show (Problem 32) that z is proportional to the speed
of the source toward or away from us:
(33;6)
But redshifts are not always small, in which case the approximation of Eq. 33–6 is
not valid. For high z galaxies, not even Eq. 33–3 applies because the redshift is due
to the expansion of space (cosmolog
