oppers also eat vegetation. In the oceans, herbivores
include snails, sea urchins, and manatees. Like predators, herbivores have
special adaptations for grazing the right plant body or flower, such as
specialized teeth or a modified digestive system. Plants have evolved
spines and thorns and chemical poisons, such as strychnine, mescaline,
morphine, and nicotine, to fend off attacks by animals.
4. Symbiosis
When two or more species live in direct and intimate contact with each
other, their relationship is called symbiotic. These relationships can be
helpful, neutral, or harmful.
MUTUALISM is a symbiotic relationship where both organisms
benefit (+/+). An example is the bacteria that live in the human
intestine and produce vitamins. Another example of mutualism is
mycorrhizae, symbiotic relationships between roots and fungi that
enhance nutrient uptake and were critical to the development of
vascular plants.
COMMENSALISM is a symbiotic relationship where one organism
benefits and one is
