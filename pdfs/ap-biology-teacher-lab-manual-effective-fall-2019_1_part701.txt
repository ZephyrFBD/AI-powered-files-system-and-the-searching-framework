 a data table? Did they correctly  
label the X and Y axes and appropriately title the graph?  
3. Have the students prepare a lesson on transpiration for younger students at the 
school, following the adage that “you can’t really learn something until you have to 
teach it.” 
4. Have the students come up with a list of common misconceptions they had about 
the process of transpiration before conducting their investigations. 
5. Did the students have an adequate (i.e., basic) understanding of water potential 
and the movement of water and nutrients across cell membranes before designing 
their experiment to investigate transpiration? Did the students have an adequate 
understanding of the physical and chemical properties of water before investigating 
transpiration? 
6. Were the students able to determine leaf surface by using appropriate mathematical 
skills? Which applications of mathematical skills were challenging for the students? 
7. If you used the suggested gas pressure sensor
