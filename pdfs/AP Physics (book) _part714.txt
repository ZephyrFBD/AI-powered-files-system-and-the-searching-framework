uite reached, since at least a little thermal energy is always produced
during a collision (also perhaps sound and other forms of energy). The col-
lision of two hard elastic balls, such as billiard balls, however, is very close to
being perfectly elastic, and we often treat it as such.
We do need to remember that even when kinetic energy is not conserved,
the total energy is always conserved.
Collisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are said to be inelastic
collisions. The kinetic energy that is lost is changed into other forms of energy,
often thermal energy, so that the total energy (as always) is conserved. In this case,
See Fig. 7–12, and the details in its caption.
7–5 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension
We now apply the conservation laws for momentum and kinetic energy to an elastic
collision between two small objects that collide head-on, so all the motion is along a
line. To be general, we assume that the two objects are moving, and their velocities
are 
and 
along
