When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is said to be unsaturated. Oleic acid is an example of
an unsaturated fatty acid (Figure 3.16).
Figure 3.16 Oleic acid is a common unsaturated fatty acid.
Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called oils. If there is one double bond in the molecule, then
it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a
polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).
When a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is known as a saturated fatty acid because no more hydrogen may be added to the
carbon atoms of the chain. A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. Long straight fatty acids
with single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic
acid (common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fa
