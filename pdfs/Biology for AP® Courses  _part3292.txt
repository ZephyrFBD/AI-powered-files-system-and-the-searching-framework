B. Construct an explanation of the mechanism for
transmission of information when the odorant molecule is
detected at receptor A using this signaling cascade. In your
explanation include the role of positive feedback and the
mechanism of the generation of an action potential.
Signal integration allows the brain to discriminate this
particular odorant mixture from others using the time
dependence in each signal. The sensitivity of an olfactory
system increases as the number of unique receptors
increases.
C. Complete the following table to construct a
mathematical representation of sensitivity to the
chemical landscape assuming that there are 100 unique
odorant molecules. Use the following mathematic routine
to determine the number of odors caused by groups of
molecules selected from the 100 odorant molecules:
Number, r, of odor-
producing molecules in the
odorant
Number of
different odorants
