■Activity II: DNA Mapping Using Restriction Enzymes
One application of restriction enzymes is restriction mapping. Restriction mapping is 
the process of cutting DNA at specific sequences with restriction enzymes, separating 
the fragments from each other by a process called gel electrophoresis (without pasting 
any fragments together), and then estimating the size of those fragments. The size and 
number of DNA fragments provide information about the structure of the original 
pieces of DNA from which they were cut.
Restriction mapping enables scientists to create a genetic signature or DNA
