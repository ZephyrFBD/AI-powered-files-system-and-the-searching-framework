Segregation and independent assortment apply to genes on different chromosomes.

Figure 8.2 The Dihybrid Cross
The genes for height and seed color are not on the same chromosome
and will assort independently. The only factor that determines how these
alleles segregate or assort is how the homologous pairs line up in
metaphase of meiosis I, which is random.
During metaphase I, if the homologous pairs happen to line up like this:
they will produce these gametes:
If the homologous pairs happen to line up like this:
 
they will produce these gametes:

In contrast, if the gene for tall is linked to the gene for yellow seed
color and the gene for short is linked to the gene for green seed color, the
genes will not assort independently. If a plant is tall, it will have yellow
seeds. If a plant is short, it will have green seeds. See Figure 8.3.
