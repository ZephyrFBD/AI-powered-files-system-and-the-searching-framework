his type of
defensive mechanism is called aposematic coloration, or warning coloration (Figure 36.22).
Figure 36.22 (a) The strawberry poison dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators
that it is toxic, while the (b) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) uses aposematic coloration to warn predators of the
unpleasant odor it produces. (credit a: modification of work by Jay Iwasaki; credit b: modification of work by Dan

While some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved
mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat
or contain toxic chemicals. In Batesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one.
Assuming they share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the
same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as
