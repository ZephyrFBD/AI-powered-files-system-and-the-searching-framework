orce of 100 N. Sud-
denly a second force of 100 N in the opposite direction 
is exerted on the object, so that the forces cancel. The
object
(a) is brought to rest rapidly.
(b) decelerates gradually to rest.
(c) continues at the velocity it had before the second force
was applied.
(d) is brought to rest and then accelerates in the direction
of the second force.
10. You are pushing a heavy box across a rough floor. When you
are initially pushing the box and it is accelerating,
(a) you exert a force on the box, but the box does not
exert a force on you.
(b) the box is so heavy it exerts a force on you, but you do
not exert a force on the box.
(c) the force you exert on the box is greater than the force
of the box pushing back on you.
(d) the force you exert on the box is equal to the force of
the box pushing back on you.
(e) the force that the box exerts on you is greater than the
force you exert on the box.
