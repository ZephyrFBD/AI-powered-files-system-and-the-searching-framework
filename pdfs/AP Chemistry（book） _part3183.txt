ion of electron migration, the direction of ion migration, and the signs of the electrodes.
Sample Exercise 20.4 
Describing a Voltaic Cell
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the equation for a spontaneous reaction that 
takes place in a voltaic cell and a description of how the cell is con-
structed. We are asked to write the half-reactions occurring at the 
anode and at the cathode, as well as the directions of electron and 
ion movements and the signs assigned to the electrodes.
Plan Our first step is to divide the chemical equation into half- 
reactions so that we can identify the oxidation and the reduction 
processes. We then use the definitions of anode and cathode and 
the other terminologies summarized in Figure 20.6.
Solve In one half-reaction, Cr2O7
2- 1aq2 is converted into Cr3+1aq2. 
Starting with these ions and then completing and balancing the 
half-reaction, we have
Cr2O7
2-1aq2 + 14 H+1aq2 + 6 e- ยก 2 Cr3+1aq2 + 7 H2O1l2
In the other half-reaction, I-1aq2 is converted to I21
