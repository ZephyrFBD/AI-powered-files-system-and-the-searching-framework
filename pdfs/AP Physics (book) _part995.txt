 on either side of
the sheet. Why is the tension so much greater than the weight
of the sheet?
25. (II) A man doing push-ups pauses in the position shown in
Fig.9–65. His mass
Determine the normal force
exerted by the floor (a) on each hand; (b) on each foot.
m = 68 kg.
26. (III) Two wires run from the top of a pole 2.6 m tall that
supports a volleyball net. The two wires are anchored to
the ground 2.0 m apart, and each is 2.0 m from the pole
(Fig. 9–66). The tension in each wire is 115 N. What
is the tension in the net, assumed horizontal and
attached at the top of the pole?

27. (III) A uniform rod AB of length 5.0 m and mass
is hinged at A and held in equilibrium by a light cord, as
shown in Fig. 9–67. A load
hangs from the rod
at a distance d so that the tension in the cord is 85 N.
(a) Draw a free-body diagram for the rod. (b) Determine
the vertical and horizontal forces on the rod
