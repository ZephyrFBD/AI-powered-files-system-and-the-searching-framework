Directions: There are two types of free-response questions on the AP exam: short questions and long questions.
Short free-response questions require about6minutes to answer. Long free-response questions require about 20
minutes to answer. Long questions have multiple parts, sometimes offering you a choice of questions to answer.
Answer all your questions as completely as possible within the recommended time frame. Use complete sentences
(NOT outline form) for all your answers. You may use diagrams to supplement your answers, but a diagram alone
without appropriate discussion is inadequate.
The questions that follow are typical of either an entire AP exam question or merely that part of a question that is
related to this chapter.
