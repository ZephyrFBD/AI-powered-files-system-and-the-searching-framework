qualitatively and quantitatively.
Learning
Objective
2.12 The student is able to use representations and models to analyze situations or solve
problems qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate whether dynamic homeostasis is
maintained by the active movement of molecules across membranes.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Enduring
Understanding
2.D
Growth and dynamic homeostasis of a biological system are influenced by changes in the
systemâ€™s environment.
Essential
Knowledge
2.D.4 Plants and animals have a variety of chemical defenses against infections that affect
dynamic homeostasis.
