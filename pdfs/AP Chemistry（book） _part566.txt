ds only on H+1aq2 concentration, strong 
acids are more reactive than weak acids. The reactivity of an acid, however, can depend 
on the anion as well as on H+1aq2 concentration. For example, hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a 
weak acid (only partly ionized in aqueous solution), but it is very reactive and vigorously 
attacks many substances, including glass. This reactivity is due to the combined action of 
H+1aq2 and F-1aq2.
Table 4.2 lists the strong acids and bases we are most likely to encounter. You 
need to commit this information to memory in order to correctly identify strong 
electrolytes and write net ionic equations. The brevity of this list tells us that most 
acids are weak. (For H2SO4, as we noted earlier, only the first proton completely ion-
izes.) The only common strong bases are the common soluble metal hydroxides. 
The most common weak base is NH3, which reacts with water to form OH- ions 
(Equation 4.10).
