an international research project known as 
the Human Genome Project were able to identify and map the 20,000â€“25,000 genes 
that define a human being. The project also successfully mapped the genomes of other 
species, including the fruit fly, mouse, and Escherichia coli. The location and complete 
sequence of the genes in each of these species are available for anyone in the world to 
access via the Internet.
Why is this information important? Being able to identify the precise location and 
sequence of human genes will allow us to better understand genetic diseases. In addition, 
learning about the sequence of genes in other species helps us understand evolutionary 
relationships among organisms. Many of our genes are identical or similar to those 
found in other species.
Suppose you identify a single gene that is responsible for a particular disease in fruit 
flies. Is that same gene found in humans? Does it cause a similar disease? It would take 
nearly 10 years to read through the
