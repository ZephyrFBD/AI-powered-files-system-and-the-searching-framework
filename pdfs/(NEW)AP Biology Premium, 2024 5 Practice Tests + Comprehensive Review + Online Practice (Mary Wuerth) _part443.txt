Humans have used artificial selection to produce desired traits in animals as well. Dog breeds are also a result of
artificial selection. Domesticated wolves were selectively bred for particular traits, leading to the wide variety of dog
breeds seen today. Over the last 10,000 years, human populations have selectively bred members of the aurochs (the
