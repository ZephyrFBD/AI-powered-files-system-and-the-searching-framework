  is necessary to begin precipitation? 
(Neglect volume changes. BaSO4: Ksp = 1.1 * 10-10; SrSO4: 
Ksp = 3.2 * 10-7.) (b) Which cation precipitates first? 
 
(c) What is the concentration of SO4
2 -1aq2 when the sec-
ond cation begins to precipitate?
 17.75  A solution contains three anions with the following 
c o n c e n t r a t i o n s :  0.20 M CrO4
2 -, 0.10 M CO3
2 -,  a n d 
0.010 M Cl-. If a dilute AgNO3 solution is slowly added to 
the solution, what is the first compound to precipitate: 
Ag2CrO4 1Ksp = 1.2 * 10-122, Ag2CO31Ksp = 8.1 * 10-122, 
or AgCl 1Ksp = 1.8 * 10-102?
 17.76  A 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution is slowly added to 10.0 mL of a solu-
tion that is 0.20 M in Ca2 +  and 0.30 M in Ag+. (a) Which 
compound will precipitate first: CaSO41Ksp = 2.4 * 10-52
or Ag2SO4 1Ksp = 1.5 * 10-52? (b) How much Na2SO4 solu-
tion must be added to initiate the precipitation?
