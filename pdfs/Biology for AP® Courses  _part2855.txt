ly push the organism further out of homeostasis, but
may be necessary for life to occur. Homeostasis is controlled by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals.
Negative Feedback Mechanisms
Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop. It may either increase or
decrease the stimulus, but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it. In other words, if a
level is too high, the body does something to bring it down, and conversely, if a level is too low, the body does something
to make it go up. Hence the term negative feedback. An example is animal maintenance of blood glucose levels. When
an animal has eaten, blood glucose levels rise. This is sensed by the nervous system. Specialized cells in the pancreas
sense this, and the hormone insulin is released by the endocrine system. Insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease,
as would be expected in a negative feedback system, as illustrated in Figure
