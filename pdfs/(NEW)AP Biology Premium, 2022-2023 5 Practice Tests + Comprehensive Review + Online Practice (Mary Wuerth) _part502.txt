, keeping the salamander populations
reproductively isolated.
■Reduced hybrid fertility—Even if the zygote survives to adulthood, if the adult hybrid is infertile, the two
species that created the hybrid will remain reproductively isolated. A male donkey can mate with a female
horse to produce a mule. The hybrid mules are infertile, keeping horses and donkeys as separate species.
■Hybrid breakdown—In some plants, hybrids are viable and fertile, but with each subsequent generation, the
hybrid becomes weaker and less robust and will cease to exist after a few generations. This hybrid breakdown
keeps some plant species reproductively isolated.
Extinction
Extinction (the death of all members of a species) has occurred throughout Earth’s history, as shown in evidence
from the fossil record. The level of genetic variation in a population can affect the population’s ability to survive
environmental changes. More genetically diverse populations have a greater ability to adapt to changing
