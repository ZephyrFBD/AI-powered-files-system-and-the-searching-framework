, and RbI, the mea-
sured cation–anion distances are 2.01 Å (Li–F), 2.82 Å 
 
(Na–Cl), 3.30 Å (K–Br), and 3.67 Å (Rb–I), respectively. (a) 
Predict the cation–anion distance using the values of ionic 
radii given in Figure 7.8. (b) Calculate the difference between 
the experimentally measured ion–ion distances and the ones 
predicted from Figure 7.8. (c) What estimates of the cation–
anion distance would you obtain for these four compounds 
using neutral atom bonding atomic radii? Are these estimates 
as accurate as the estimates using ionic radii?
