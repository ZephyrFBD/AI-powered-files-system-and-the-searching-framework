obic tails. Hydrophilic (“water loving”) means that a molecule
(or group of atoms) has a strong affinity for, or is capable of mixing with or dissolving in water. Hydrophobic
(“water fearing”) means the molecule resists mixing with water.
52. B. This molecule, an a-glucose polysaccharide, is starch or glycogen, both energy storage molecules. Starch is
found in plant cells, while glycogen is found in animal cells. In contrast, cellulose (not shown), a β-glucose
polysaccharide, functions as a structural element in the cell walls of plants.
53. A. Plants with an r-selected life history are opportunistic, pioneer species that reproduce and mature quickly and
produce many offspring. These species are usually the first species to invade a habitat when succession begins, when
a previously uninhabited region becomes available, or after a climax community has been destroyed.
54. D. Hardwood trees are in greatest abundance in the climax stages of succession for a temperate forest
