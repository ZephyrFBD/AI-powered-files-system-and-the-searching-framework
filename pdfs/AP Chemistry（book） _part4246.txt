Practice Exercise 2: 0.69 L@atm = 70 J
Sample Exercise 5.3
Practice Exercise 2: In order to solidify, the gold must cool to below its 
melting temperature. It cools by transferring heat to its surroundings. 
The air around the sample would feel hot because heat is transferred 
to it from the molten gold, meaning the process is exothermic. (You 
may notice that solidification of a liquid is the reverse of the melting 
we analyzed in the exercise. As we will see, reversing the direction of a 
process changes the sign of the heat transferred.)
