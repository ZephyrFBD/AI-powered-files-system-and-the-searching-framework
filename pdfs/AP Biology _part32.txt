ATOMIC STRUCTURE
Atoms are the building blocks of all matter. Atoms consist of subatomic
particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.
An atom in the elemental state always has a neutral charge because the
number of protons (+) equals the number of electrons (â€“). Electron
configuration is important because it determines how a particular atom will
react with atoms of other elements. If all the electrons in an atom are in the
