Skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement
that can be consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle.
Skeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has
a striped or striated appearance. The striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and
myosin). Actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle also has
multiple nuclei present in a single cell.
Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around
passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels. Smooth muscle has no striations, is not un
