24–6 Diffraction Grating
A large number of equally spaced parallel slits is called a diffraction grating,
although the term “interference grating” might be as appropriate. Gratings can
be made by precision machining of very fine parallel lines on a glass plate. The
untouched spaces between the lines serve as the slits. Photographic transparen-
cies of an original grating serve as inexpensive gratings. Gratings containing
10,000 lines or slits per centimeter are common, and are very useful for precise
measurements of wavelengths. A diffraction grating containing slits is called a
transmission grating. Another type of diffraction grating is the reflection grating,
made by ruling fine lines on a metallic or glass surface from which light is reflected
and analyzed. The anal
