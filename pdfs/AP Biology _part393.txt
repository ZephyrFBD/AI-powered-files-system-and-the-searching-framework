relationships among organisms. Our current system reflects the idea that
all organisms descend from a common ancestor. This system is called the
three-domain system. In it, all life is organized into three domains:
Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
Figure 10.1 shows the organization of the current three-domain system
of classification. (The term Monera is no longer used in this system.
Instead, prokaryotes are spread across two different domains: Archaea
and Bacteria.)

Our classification system reflects evolutionary relationships.
Table 10.1 shows a comparison of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes.
Notice, for some characteristics, the archaea resemble eukaryotes more
than they resemble prokaryotes.
