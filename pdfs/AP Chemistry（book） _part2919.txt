 (Section 13.5) In osmosis, the solvent passes from the more 
dilute solution into the more concentrated one. However, if sufficient external pres-
sure is applied, osmosis can be stopped and, at still higher pressures, reversed. When 
reverse osmosis occurs, solvent passes from the more concentrated into the more 
dilute solution. In a modern reverse-osmosis facility, hollow fibers are used as the 
semipermeable membrane (Figure 18.20). Saline water (water containing significant 
salts) is introduced under pressure into the fibers, and desalinated water is recovered.
The world’s largest desalination plant, in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, provides 50% of that 
country’s drinking water by using reverse osmosis to desalinate seawater from the Per-
sian Gulf. An even larger plant, which will produce 600 million L/day (160 million gal-
lons) of drinking water, is scheduled for completion in Saudi Arabia in 2018. Such plants 
are becoming increasingly common in the United States. The largest,
