describe certain features of spectra before quantum mechanics was developed.
Give It Some Thought
Is the distance between the electron and the nucleus fixed for an electron in a 
specific orbit in the Bohr model of the atom? Is this distance fixed for an electron in 
a specific orbital?

CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
The collection of orbitals with the same value of n is called an electron shell. 
All the orbitals that have n = 3, for example, are said to be in the third shell. The set of 
 
orbitals that have the same n and l values is called a subshell. Each subshell is desig-
nated by a number (the value of n) and a letter (s, p, d, or f, corresponding to the value of 
l). For example, the orbitals that have n = 3 and l = 2 are called 3d orbitals and are in the 
3d subshell.
Table 6.2 summarizes the possible values of l and ml for values 
of n through n = 4. The restrictions on possible values give rise to 
the following very important obs
