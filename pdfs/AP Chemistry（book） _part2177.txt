tion increases, the frequency with which the reactant molecules 
collide increases, leading to increased rates.
3. Reaction temperature. Reaction rates generally increase as temperature is increased. 
The bacterial reactions that spoil milk, for instance, proceed more rapidly at room 
temperature than at the lower temperature of a refrigerator. Increasing temperature 
increases the kinetic energies of molecules. 
 (Section 10.7) As molecules move 
more rapidly, they collide more frequently and with higher energy, leading to in-
creased reaction rates.
4. The presence of a catalyst. Catalysts are agents that increase reaction rates without them-
selves being used up. They affect the kinds of collisions (and therefore alter the mecha-
nism) that lead to reaction. Catalysts play many crucial roles in living organisms.
On a molecular level, reaction rates depend on the frequency of collisions between 
molecules. The greater the frequency of collisions, the higher the reaction rate. For a c
