ins is widespread in plant nurseries and for crop production. IAA is used as a rooting hormone
to promote growth of adventitious roots on cuttings and detached leaves. Applying synthetic auxins to tomato plants in
greenhouses promotes normal fruit development. Outdoor application of auxin promotes synchronization of fruit setting
and dropping to coordinate the harvesting season. Fruits such as seedless cucumbers can be induced to set fruit by treating
unfertilized plant flowers with auxins.
Cytokinins
The effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing
plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth. The stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin, a hormone that
promotes cytokinesis (cell division). Almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date. Cytokinins
are most abundant in growing tissues, such as roots, embryos, and fruits, where cell division is occurring. Cytokinins are
