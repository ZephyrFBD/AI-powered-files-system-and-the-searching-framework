Figure 36.10 (a) Yeast grown in ideal conditions in a test tube show a classical S-shaped logistic growth curve,
whereas (b) a natural population of seals shows real-world fluctuation.

Explain the underlying reasons for the differences in the two curves shown in these examples.
a.
Yeast is grown under ideal conditions, so the curve reflects limitations of resources in the controlled
environment. Seals live in a natural habitat where the same types of resources are limited; but, they face
other pressures like migration and changing weather.
b.
Yeast is grown under natural conditions, so the curve reflects limitations of resources due to the environment.
Seals were also observed in natural conditions; but, there were more pressures in addition to the limitation of
resources like migration and changing weather.
c.
Yeast is grown under ideal conditions, so the curve reflects limitations of resour
