s and males are affected, but only females appear to be able to pass the trait on to the next
generationâ€”these are hallmarks of mitochondrial inheritance. Autosomal traits are equally likely in both sexes,
so choices (A) and (B) are incorrect. Sex-linked traits are more likely to appear in males than females, so choice
(C) is incorrect.
10. (A) This is most likely a mitochondrial trait (see the explanation for Question 9). Individual III-3 does not have
the trait, so he does not carry the allele. Even if he did carry the allele, males cannot pass on mitochondrial traits
to the next generation. If he has a child with a woman who also does not have the allele, there is 0% chance of
them having a child with the trait since neither of them have the allele for the trait. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are
incorrect because if the woman does not have the allele for a mitochondrial trait, her offspring will not have the
allele for the trait.
