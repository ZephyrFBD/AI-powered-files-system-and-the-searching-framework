 form solid
waste, or feces. Feces are stored at the end of the large intestine, in the rectum, and excreted through the anus.
Various harmless and symbiotic bacteria live in the large intestine, including some that produce vitamin K, which is
absorbed through the intestinal wall. At the beginning of the large intestine, there is a short branch to a dead-end
pouch that bears a finger-like projection called the appendix. Other than a possible role in the immune response, the
appendix is significant only when it becomes inflamed, causing appendicitis. In herbivores, the dead-end pouch is
much enlarged and is called the cecum. It harbors bacteria that help in the digestion of cellulose.
Hormones are involved in the digestive process. Three important hormones are described below:
1. Gastrin is produced by cells in the stomach lining when food reaches the stomach or when the nervous system,
through smell or sight, senses the availability of food. Gastrin enters the bloodstream and stimulate
