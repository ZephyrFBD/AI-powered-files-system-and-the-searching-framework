re finches with smaller beaks to survive. There is no evidence in the question that suggests females
have a mate preference that is dependent on beak size, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect
because there is no evidence for predators killing more finches of either beak size. The question does not give

3. (A) DNA sequences are generally considered stronger pieces of evidence of evolution because environmental
factors are far less likely to change the DNA sequence of a fossil. Choice (B) is incorrect because geological
events can change the relative positions of fossils in rock layers and make the original location of the fossil
position less certain. Birds can fly and move to new habitats, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect
because mating behaviors of birds may be influenced by their environments or by learning these behaviors from
other birds.
