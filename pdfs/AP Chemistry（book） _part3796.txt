and beer, 
are well-known molecules that at the proper 
doses give us pleasure. Spices, as shown in the 
chapter-opening photograph, contain a host of 
molecules such as capsaicin (in chili peppers) and 
vanillin (in the vanilla bean). Other plant-derived 
compounds include quinine, for treating malaria, 
and taxol, for treating many cancers.

 24.1 ▶  General Characteristics of Organic 
Molecules Review the structures and 
properties of organic compounds.
 
24.2 ▶  Introduction to Hydrocarbons  
Consider hydrocarbons, compounds containing 
only C and H, including the hydrocarbons 
called alkanes, which contain only single C¬C  
bonds. We also look at isomers, compounds 
with identical compositions but different 
molecular structures.
 24.3 ▶  Alkenes, Alkynes, and Aromatic 
Hydrocarbons Explore hydrocarbons 
with one or more C “ C bonds, called 
alkenes, and those with one or more 
C ‚ C bonds, called alkynes. Aromatic
