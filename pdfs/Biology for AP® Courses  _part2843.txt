Smooth Muscle
Smooth muscle does not have striations in its cells. It has a single, centrally located nucleus, as shown in Figure 24.18.
Constriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary, autonomic nervous control and in response to local conditions in
the tissues. Smooth muscle tissue is also called non-striated as it lacks the banded appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle.
The walls of blood vessels, the tubes of the digestive system, and the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of
mostly smooth muscle.
