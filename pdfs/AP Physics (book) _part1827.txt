What is the magnitude of the net
electric field at the third vertex? If a third identical
negative charge was located at the third vertex, then what
would be the net electrostatic force on it due to the other
two charges? Use symmetry and explain how you used it.
7. Suppose that electrical attraction, rather than gravity, were
responsible for holding the Moon in orbit around the Earth.
If equal and opposite charges Q were placed on the Earth
and the Moon, what should be the value of Q to maintain
the present orbit? Use data given on the inside front cover
of this book. Treat the Earth and Moon as point particles.
