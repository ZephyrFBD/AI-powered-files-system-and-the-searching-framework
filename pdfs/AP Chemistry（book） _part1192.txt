CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
(b) Strontium is added to water. (c) Sodium reacts with oxy-
gen. (d) Calcium reacts with iodine.
 7.71  (a) As described in Section 7.7, the alkali metals react with 
hydrogen to form hydrides and react with halogens to form 
halides. Compare the roles of hydrogen and halogens in 
these reactions. Write balanced equations for the reaction of 
fluorine with calcium and for the reaction of hydrogen with 
calcium. (b) What is the oxidation number and electron 
configuration of calcium in each product?
 7.72  Potassium and hydrogen react to form the ionic compound 
potassium hydride. (a) Write a balanced equation for this 
reaction. (b) Use data in Figures 7.10 and 7.12 to determine 
the energy change in kJ/mol for the following two reactions:
K1g2 + H1g2 ยก  K+1g2 + H-1g2  
K1g2 + H1g2 ยก  K-1g2 + H+1g2
 
(c) Based on your calculated energy changes in (b), which of 
these reactions is energetically more favorable (or less unfa-
vorable)?
