which is not the same as the maximum at any
pH because each enzyme has an optimal pH at which it functions
best). Therefore (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because the rate should
increase with more substrate (unless already at maximum). (C) is
incorrect because the reaction rate would increase unless it is already
at the maximum value for that pH. The fact that the rate seems
unusually favorable at 7.75 is irrelevant and could just be random
variation. (D) is incorrect because there is no guarantee that the rate
will increase to the value obtained for a pH of 7.25.

The lowest KM value in the table occurs for the wild type enzyme with
the NADP+ cofactor, which also has the highest value for kcat/KM. This
indicates that the wild type enzyme with NADP+ is far more eﬀicient
than any of the alternatives. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because
the wild type enzyme is more eﬀicient with NAD+ and reaches
maximum velocity at a lower concentration than the m
