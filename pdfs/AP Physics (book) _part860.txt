Spinning bicycle wheel. Your physics
teacher is holding a spinning bicycle wheel while he stands on a stationary
frictionless turntable (Fig. 8–32). What will happen if the teacher suddenly flips
the bicycle wheel over so that it is spinning in the opposite direction?
RESPONSE We consider the system of turntable, teacher, and bicycle wheel.
The total angular momentum initially is 
vertically upward. That is also what
the system’s angular momentum must be afterward, since 
is conserved 
when there is no net torque. Thus, if the wheel’s angular momentum after being
flipped over is 
downward, then the angular momentum of teacher plus
turntable will have to b
