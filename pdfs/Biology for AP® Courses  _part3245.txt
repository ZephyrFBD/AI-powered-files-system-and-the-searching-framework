lls of the eye, where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs, are located in the retina
(shown in Figure 27.17) on the inner surface of the back of the eye. But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered. It
passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina (Figure 27.17b). The cornea, the front
transparent layer of the eye, and the crystalline lens, a transparent convex structure behind the cornea, both refract (bend)
light to focus the image on the retina. The iris, which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye, is a circular muscular
ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. In conditions of high ambient
light, the iris contracts, reducing the size of the pupil at its center. In conditions of low light, the iris relaxes and the pupil
enlarges.
