equal masses of ice at
0°C and steam at 100°C are mixed together?
50. A mountain climber wears a goose-down jacket 3.5 cm thick
with total surface area 
The temperature at the 
surface of the clothing is
and at the skin is 34°C.
Determine the rate of heat flow by conduction through the
jacket assuming (a) it is dry and the thermal conductivity k is
that of goose down, and (b) the jacket is wet, so k is that 
of water and the jacket has matted to 0.50 cm thickness.

Assuming that 20% of this goes into useful
work and the other 80% is converted to heat, estimate the
temperature rise of the body after 45 min if none of this
heat is transferred to the environment.
