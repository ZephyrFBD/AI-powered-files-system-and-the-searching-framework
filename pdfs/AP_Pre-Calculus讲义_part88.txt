(b) Sketch a graph of V. 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, the sine or cosine functions representing harmonic motion may be shifted 
horizontally or vertically. 
In this case, the equations take the form

or
cos( (

The vertical shift b indicates that the variation occurs around an average value b. 
The horizontal shift c indicates the position of the object at t = 0.

k is the initial amplitude, and

Damped harmonic motion is simply harmonic motion for which the amplitude is governed 
by the function a(t) = ke-ct.
