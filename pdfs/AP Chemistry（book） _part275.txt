contains virtually all the mass of the atom.

the nucleus in units of pm?
Give It Some Thought 
(a) If an atom has 15 protons, how many electrons does it have?
(b) Where do the protons reside in an atom?
Atoms have extremely small masses. The mass of the heaviest known atom, 
for example, is approximately 4 * 10-22 g. Because it would be cumbersome to 
express such small masses in grams, we use the atomic mass unit (amu),** where 
1 amu = 1.66054 * 10-24 g. A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu, a neutron 1.0087 
amu, and an electron 5.486 * 10-4 amu (Table 2.1). Because it takes 1836 electrons to 
equal the mass of one proton, and 1839 electrons to equal the mass of a single neu-
tron, the nucleus accounts for nearly the entire mass of an atom.
*The electron is an elementary particle that cannot be divided into smaller particles, whereas 
protons and neutrons are made up of
