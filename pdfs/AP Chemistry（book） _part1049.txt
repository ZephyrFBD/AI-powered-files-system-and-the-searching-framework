in 1922 that 
element 72 was present in a sample of Norwegian zircon, 
an ore of zirconium. (The name hafnium comes from the 
Latin name for Copenhagen, Hafnia). (a) How would you 
use electron conﬁguration arguments to justify Bohr’s pre-
diction? (b) Zirconium, hafnium’s neighbor in group 4B, 
can be produced as a metal by reduction of solid ZrCl4 with 
molten sodium metal. Write a balanced chemical equation 
for the reaction. Is this an oxidation-reduction reaction? If 
yes, what is reduced and what is oxidized? (c) Solid zirconi-
um dioxide, ZrO2, reacts with chlorine gas in the presence 
of carbon. The products of the reaction are ZrCl4 and two 
gases, CO2 and CO in the ratio 1:2. Write a balanced chem-
ical equation for the reaction. Starting with a 55.4-g sam-
ple of ZrO2, calculate the mass of ZrCl4 formed, assuming 
that ZrO2 is the limiting reagent and assuming 100% yield. 
 
(d) Using their electron conﬁgurations, account for the fact 
that Zr and Hf form chlorides MCl4 and
