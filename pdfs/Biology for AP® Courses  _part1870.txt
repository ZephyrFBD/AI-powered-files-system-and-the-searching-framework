Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an
organism’s DNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors
generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the
recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a
different species, the host organism is called transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since
the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as herbicide-resistant
soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.
