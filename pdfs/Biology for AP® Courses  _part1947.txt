 studying mitochondrial
genomics that is most directly important for humans?
a.
Mitochondria evolved from bacteria; therefore,
their genome is important to study.
b.
Mitochondria undergo rapid mutation and it is
essential that this pattern be studied.
c.
Mitochondria contain DNA, and it is passed on
from mother to offspring, which renders it
helpful in tracing genealogy.
d.
Mitochondria are the only ATP-producing
organelles of the cell, thus their genome is
important.
41. How can proteomics complement genomics?
a.
The genes are responsible to produce proteins
and this implies that proteomics complements
genomics.
b.
Genomics is responsible to decide the structure
of the proteins, and, thereby, the result of
proteomic studies.
c.
The genome is constant but the proteome is
dynamic as different tissues possess the same
genes but express different genes, thereby
complementing genomics.
d.
The study of genes is incomplete without the
study of their respective proteins and thus they
compleme
