ry. Calculate (a) the potential difference
across each capacitor and (b) the charge on each. (c) Repeat
parts (a) and (b) assuming the two capacitors are in parallel.
47. (II) A circuit contains a single 250-pF capacitor hooked
across a battery. It is desired to store four times as much
energy in a combination of two capacitors by adding a
single capacitor to this one. How would you hook it up, and
what would its value be?
48. (II) Suppose three parallel-plate capacitors, whose plates
have areas 
and 
and separations 
and 
are connected in parallel. Show, using only Eq. 17–8, that
Eq. 19–5 is valid.
49. (II) Two capacitors connected in parallel produce an
equivalent capacitance of 
but when connected in
series the equivalent capacitance is only 
What is
the individual capacitance of each capacitor?
50. (III) Given three capacitors,
and 
what arrangement of parallel and series
connections with a 12-V battery will give the minimum
voltage drop across the 
capacitor? What is the
minimum v
