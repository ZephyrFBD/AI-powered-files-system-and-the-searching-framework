Exercise 2
(a) A laser used in orthopedic spine surgery produces radia-
tion with a wavelength of 2.10 mm. Calculate the frequency 
of this radiation. (b) An FM radio station broadcasts electro-
magnetic radiation at a frequency of 103.4 MHz (megahertz; 
1 MHz = 106 s - 1). Calculate the wavelength of this radiation. 
The speed of light is 2.998 * 108 m>s to four significant 
figures.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the wavelength, l, of the radiation and asked 
to calculate its frequency, n.
Plan The relationship between the wavelength and the frequency 
is given by Equation 6.1. We can solve for n and use the values 
of l and c to obtain a numerical answer. (The speed of light, c, is 
3.00 * 108 m>s  to three significant figures.)
Solve Solving Equation 6.1 for frequency gives n = c>l. When we 
insert the values for c and l, we note that the units of length in these 
two quantities are different. We use a conversion factor to convert 
the wavelength from nanometers to meters, so the un
