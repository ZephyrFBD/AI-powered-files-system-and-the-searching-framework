ch reaction rates are 
studied. Factors that affect reaction rate are the physical state of the 
reactants; concentration; temperature; and the presence of catalysts.
REACTION RATES (SECTION 14.2) Reaction rates are usually 
expressed as changes in concentration per unit time: Typically, for 
reactions in solution, rates are given in units of molarity per second 
1M>s2. For most reactions, a plot of molarity versus time shows that 
the rate slows down as the reaction proceeds. The instantaneous rate 
is the slope of a line drawn tangent to the concentration-versus-time 
curve at a specific time. Rates can be written in terms of the appear-
ance of products or the disappearance of reactants; the stoichiometry 
of the reaction dictates the relationship between rates of appearance 
and disappearance.
RATES AND CONCENTRATION (SECTION 14.3) The quantitative 
relationship between rate and concentration is expressed by a rate 
law, which usually has the following form:
Rate = k3reactant 14m3r
