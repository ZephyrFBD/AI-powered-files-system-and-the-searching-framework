migration to avoid seasonal temperature
changes.
45. The extremely low precipitation of subtropical desert
biomes might lead one to expect fire to be a major
disturbance factor. However, fire is more common in the
temperate grassland biome than in the sub tropic desert
biome. Why is this?
a.
Due to higher net primary productivity, biomass
in deserts is significantly more than in temperate
grassland biomes. However, it is easier for fire to
spread in grasslands as they are found in
abundance.
b.
Due to lower net primary productivity, biomass
in deserts is significantly less than in temperate
grassland biomes. It is easier for fire to spread in
grasslands as they are found in abundance.
c.
Due to lower net primary productivity, biomass
in deserts is significantly less than in temperate
grassland biomes. It is easier for fire to spread in
grasslands as they have very low precipitation
and high temperatures.
d.
Due to higher net primary productivity, biomas
