 visible light).
What is the theoretical minimum angular separation of two stars that can just be
resolved by (a) the 200-inch telescope on Palomar Mountain (Fig. 25–22c); and
(b) the Arecibo radiotelescope (Fig. 25–33), whose diameter is 300 m and whose
radius of curvature is also 300 m. Assume 
for the visible-light
telescope in part (a), and
(the shortest wavelength at which the radio-
telescope has operated) in part (b).
APPROACH We apply the Rayleigh criterion (Eq. 25–7) for each telescope.
SOLUTION (a) With
we have from Eq. 25–7 that
or 
deg. (Note that this is equivalent to resolving two points less
than 1 cm apart from a distance of 100 km!)
(b) For radio waves with
emitted by stars, the resolution is
The resolution is less because the wavelength is so much larger, but the larger
objective collects more radiation and thus detects fainter objects.
NOTE In both cases, we determined the limit set by diffraction. The resolution
for a visible-light Earth-bound telescope is not this
