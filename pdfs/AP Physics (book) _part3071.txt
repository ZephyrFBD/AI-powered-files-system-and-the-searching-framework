ns would behave as ordinary-sized objects do. Nonetheless, he felt that
where quantum theory overlaps with the macroscopic world, it should predict
classical results. This is the correspondence principle, already mentioned in
regard to relativity (Section 26–11). This principle does work for Bohr’s theory
of the hydrogen atom. The orbit sizes and energies are quite different for
and 
say. But orbits with 
and 100,000,001 would be very
close in radius and energy (see Fig. 27–29). Indeed, transitions between such
large orbits, which would approach macroscopic sizes, would be imperceptible.
Such orbits would thus appear to be continuously spaced, which is what we
expect in the everyday world.
Finally, it must be emphasized that the well-defined orbits of the Bohr model
do not actually exist. The Bohr model is only a model, not reality. The idea of
electron orbits was rejected a few years later, and today electrons are thought of
(Chapter 28) as forming “probability clouds.”
