ter may evaporate. Plants need to open their stomata to
take in the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis, but each time the stomata are open, water is lost from the
plant. Plants need to constantly balance their needs for carbon dioxide and water; this is referred to as the
transpiration-photosynthesis compromise.
Transpiration also helps pull water up from the roots of a plant to its leaves. When water evaporates from the
stomata, the water potential of the leaves decrease. Water flows from areas of higher water potential to areas of
lower water potential. As water evaporates through the stomata in the leaves, the cohesion of water molecules (due
to waterâ€™s ability to form hydrogen bonds) will pull water up from the stems and roots of the plant, which have a
higher water potential than the leaves of the plant. This process is called transpirational pull.
Different environmental factors can affect the rate of water loss through transpiration. If the environment that
