 the pyruvate, converting it to CO2 and
lactic acid.
(A)
Pyruvate is a product of glycolysis, which is reduced to
ethanol by yeast, so adding pyruvate would increase CO2
production.
(B)
Magnesium sulfate activates enzymes in fermentation in
yeast, increasing CO2 production.
(C)
Sodium fluoride inhibits anaerobic respiration and promotes
aerobic respiration, thus decreasing CO2 production.
(D)
7. Since mitochondria are absent, the electron transport chain (ETC)
in bacteria is located in the plasma membrane and is generally
shorter than the mitochondrial transport chain in eukaryotes.
Which of the following best describes the ETC in bacteria under
aerobic conditions? Â 
Oxygen donates an electron to initiate the bacterial ETC.
(A)
The bacterial ETC generates ATP via alcoholic fermentation.
(B)
Electrons are pumped from one side of the membrane to the
other along the bacterial ETC.
(C)
The bacterial ETC has a lower ATP-to-oxygen ratio than the
mitochondrial ETC.
(D)
8. Which of the followi
