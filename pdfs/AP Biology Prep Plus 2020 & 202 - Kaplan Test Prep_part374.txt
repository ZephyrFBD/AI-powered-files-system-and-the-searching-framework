1. D
Learning Objective: 9.1
Enzymes can only catalyze one reaction at a time and it takes a certain
amount of time for the reaction to occur. Unless the enzyme
concentration is increased, the enzymes become saturated at high
concentrations of substrate, and the rate stops increasing with
increasing substrate concentration. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because the graph provides no information about temperature. (B) is
incorrect because the varying concentrations of AR are represented by
the diﬀerent curves in the graph, not by the variation along the x-axis,
as for H2O2. (C) is incorrect because there is no data provided in the
graph that suggests that high H2O2 concentrations prevent the active
site from changing shape as needed—the reaction rate does not
decrease at higher concentrations.
2. B
Learning Objective: 9.2
The lower the KM value, the lower the concentration of substrate
necessary to reach maximum velocity. Similarly, the low
