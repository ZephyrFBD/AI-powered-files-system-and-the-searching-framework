ugh the blood capillary wall, into the blood, and into red blood cells. Carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite
direction.
6. Bulk flow of O2. The circulatory system transports O2throughout the body within red blood cells. Red blood
cells contain hemoglobin, iron
 
containing proteins to which O2 bonds.
7. Diffusion between blood and cells. Blood capillaries permeate the body. Oxygen diffuses out of the red blood
cells, across blood capillary walls, into interstitial fluids (the fluids surrounding the cells), and across cell
membranes. Carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction.
8. Bulk flow of CO2. Most CO2 is transported as dissolved bicarbonate
 
ions (HCO3− ) in the plasma, the liquid portion of the blood. The formation of HCO3−, however, occurs in the red
blood cells, where the
 
formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) is catalyzed by the enzyme
 
carbonic anhydrase, as follows:
 
CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + HCO3−
 
Following their formation in the red blood cells, HCO3−ions diffus
