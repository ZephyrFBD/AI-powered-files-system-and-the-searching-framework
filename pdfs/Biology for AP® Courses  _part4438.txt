sh. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to
take hold.
Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their
height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these
trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years
by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment
brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine,
oak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach
its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This
equilibrium state is referre
