kweed plant is
another. The milkweed plant contains poisons that deter herbivores from
eating them. The butterfly lays its eggs in the milkweed plant and when the
larvae (caterpillars) hatch, they feed on the milkweed and absorb the
poisonous chemicals from the plant. They store the poison in their tissues.
This poison, which is present in the adult butterfly, makes the butterfly
toxic to any animal who tries to eat it. (The butterfly exhibits bright
conspicuous warning colors that deter predators.)
Adaptive Radiation
Adaptive radiation is the emergence of numerous species from a common
ancestor introduced into an environment. Each newly emerging form
specializes to fill an ecological niche. All 14 species of Darwinâ€™s finches
that live on the Galapagos Islands today diverged from a single ancestral
species perhaps 10,000 years ago. There are currently six ground finches,
six tree finches, one warbler finch, and one bud eater.
