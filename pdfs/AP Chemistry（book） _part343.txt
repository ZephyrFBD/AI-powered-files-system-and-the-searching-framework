name of the alcohol is derived from that of the alkane by adding an -ol ending:

Alcohols have properties that are very different from those of the alkanes from which 
the alcohols are obtained. For example, methane, ethane, and propane are all color-
less gases under normal conditions, whereas methanol, ethanol, and propanol are 
colorless liquids. We will discuss the reasons for these differences in Chapter 11.
The prefix “1” in the name 1-propanol indicates that the replacement of H with OH 
has occurred at one of the “outer” carbon atoms rather than the “middle” carbon atom. 
A different compound, called either 2-propanol or isopropyl alcohol, is obtained when 
the OH functional group is attached to the middle carbon atom (Figure 2.26).
