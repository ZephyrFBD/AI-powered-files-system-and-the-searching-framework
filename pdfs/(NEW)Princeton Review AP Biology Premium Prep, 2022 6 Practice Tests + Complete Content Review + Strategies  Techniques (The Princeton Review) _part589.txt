nase) binds a regulatory cyclin.
Once together, the complex is activated, can affect many proteins in the cell, and causes the cell cycle to
continue. To do this, the CDK transfers phosphate groups onto other molecules. If there are inadequate
phosphate groups, CDK would not function properly and the cell cycle would not progress, which rules
out (A). Tumor suppressor proteins inhibit cell cycle progression and can trigger apoptosis, which rules
out (B). To inhibit cell cycle progression, CDKs and cyclins are kept separate. Together, they promote the
cell cycle. If a cyclin is unable to release from its cyclin dependent kinase, the cell cycle would be
promoted, not stopped, making (C) correct. Choice (D) couldâ€™ve been eliminated because an inhibitor of a
cyclin gene would prevent expression of the cyclin gene. With lower levels of the cyclin protein, cell
cycle progression would be inhibited.

Because neurons are not capable of dividing, it is reasonable to conclude that these cel
