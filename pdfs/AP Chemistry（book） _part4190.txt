rders 
of 2 and 1.5 for O2 and O3, respectively. Bond strength increases with 
increasing bond order so we would expect stronger O ¬ O bonds in 
O2. page 775 Yes; Cl is neither a product nor a reactant in the over-
all reaction, and its presence does speed the reaction up. page 779  
SO3 page 780 NO2 photodissociates to NO and O; the O atoms 
react with O2 in the atmosphere to form ozone, which is a key ingre-
dient in photochemical smog. page 783 Higher humidity means 
there is more water in the air. Water absorbs infrared light, which we 
feel as heat. After sundown, the ground that has been warmed earlier 
in the day reradiates heat out. In locations with higher humidity, this 
energy is absorbed somewhat by the water and in turn is reradiated 
to some extent back to the Earth, resulting in warmer temperatures 
compared to a low-humidity location. page 784 You can see from 
the phase diagram that to pass from the solid to the gaseous state we 
need to be below water’s critical point
