seful tool for AP 
science teachers, as each of the cognitive processes and subprocesses addresses two or 
more of the science practices. If you modify your traditional labs with MAPSI as your 
guide, you will be addressing several science practices. 
■ The Next Steps 
The investigations in this manual support concepts, enduring understandings, and 
science practices described in the curriculum framework. Many of the labs are new, 
while others are modifications of familiar labs that have been revised to reflect the shift 
toward more student-directed and inquiry-based investigations. The following table 
shows how the current Lab 11: Transpiration differs from Lab 9: Transpiration from the 
College Board’s 2001 AP Biology Lab Manual. The differences highlight elements that 
should be considered when creating an inquiry-based investigation.
