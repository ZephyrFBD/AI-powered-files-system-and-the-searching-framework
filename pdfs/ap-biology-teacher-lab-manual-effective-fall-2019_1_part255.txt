kely to understand what BLAST is doing when it searches for 
sequence similarities. A simple analogy is the sticky note and the library. Tell students 
that they have a three-word phrase written on a sticky note. Their job is to go to the 
school library, look for every book that has that three-word phrase, and write down the 
exact page number and name of every book they find. Next, they must search for every 
book that has their three-word phrase, even if the spelling is not perfect. They must keep 
doing this until they find every last book that has a part of their three-word phrase. Their 
last chore is to put all the names and page numbers of the books they found in order, 
from most to least similar to their original phrase. If students are not impressed with 
the library analogy, tell them to use Google to search for a three-word phrase (with near 
matches) and categorize the hits for the entire Web. That is essentially what BLAST is 
doing in a few seconds.
