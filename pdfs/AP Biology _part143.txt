ation is passed to the next generation by the cell cycle
and by either mitosis or meiosis plus fertilization.
Independent Assortment of Chromosomes
During meiosis, homologous pairs of chromosomes separate depending on
the random way in which they line up on the metaphase plate during
metaphase I. Each pair of chromosomes can line up in two possible
orientations. There is a 50 percent chance that any particular gamete will
receive a maternal chromosome and a 50 percent chance it will receive a
paternal chromosome. Given that there are 23 pairs of chromosomes in
humans, the number of possible combinations of maternal and paternal
chromosomes in each gamete is 223, or about 8 million.
Crossover
Crossover produces recombinant chromosomes that combine genes
inherited from both parents. For humans, an average of two or three
crossover events occur in each chromosome pair. In addition, at metaphase
II, these recombinant chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate in
random fashion. This increa
