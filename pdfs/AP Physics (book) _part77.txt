80 km, to within 
then we write 80.0 km (three significant figures).

FIGURE 1;5 Measuring the width
of a board with a centimeter ruler.
Accuracy is about &1 mm.
When making measurements, or when doing calculations, you should avoid
the temptation to keep more digits in the final answer than is justified: see boldface
statement on previous page. For example, to calculate the area of a rectangle 11.3 cm
by 6.8 cm, the result of multiplication would be 
But this answer can not
be accurate to the implied 
uncertainty, because (using the outer limits
of the assumed uncertainty for each measurement) the result could be between
and 
At best, we can
quote the answer as 
which implies an uncertainty of about 1 or 
The other two digits (in the number 
) must be dropped (rounded off
