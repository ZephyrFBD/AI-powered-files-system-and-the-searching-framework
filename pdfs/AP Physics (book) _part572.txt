rough a distance. We consider
only translational motion for now and, unless otherwise explained, objects are
assumed to be rigid with no complicating internal motion, and can be treated like
particles. Then the work done on an object by a constant force (constant in both
magnitude and direction) is defined to be the product of the magnitude of the
displacement times the component of the force parallel to the displacement. In
equation form, we can write
where 
is the component of the constant force 
parallel to the displacement 
We can also write
(6;1)
where F is the magnitude of the constant force, d is the magnitude of the displace-
ment of the object, and is the angle between the directions of the force and the
displacement (Fig. 6–1). The 
factor appears in Eq. 6–1 because 
is the component of 
that is parallel to 
Work is a scalar quantity—it
has no direction, but only magnitude, which can be positive or negative.
Let us consider the case in which the motion and the force are in th
