2015 Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) Summary Sheet 
(Attach a copy of this page to your solution paper.)  
The recent Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) broke out in West Africa from 
February 2014.This disease spreads quickly and has claimed 8,981 lives up 
to 1 February 2015. 
In this article, we build Spread Model to forecast the development of 
EVD and the demand of medication in the future, Production Model to 
forecast the output of the medication and Delivery Model to give a most 
effective distribution scheme. Through these three models, the EVD can be 
under control in the shortest time. 
Since West Africa has suffered most from Ebola and countries in this 
region have many similarities, we use Sierra Leone as an
