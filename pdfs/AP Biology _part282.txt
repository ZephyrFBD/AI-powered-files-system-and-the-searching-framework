otype shows the
size, number, and shape of chromosomes and can reveal the presence of
certain abnormalities. Karyotypes can be used to scan for chromosomal
abnormalities in developing fetuses. Figure 8.9 shows a karyotype of a
male with Down syndrome due to the presence of an extra chromosome
21. Figure 8.10 shows a karyotype of a normal human female with 46 pairs
(the normal number) of chromosomes, including two X chromosomes (sex
chromosomes).

Changes in chromosome number often result in humans with developmental
limitations.

The bottom of Table 8.2, “Chromosomal Disorders,” describes three
conditions that result from nondisjunction in the formation of the ovum or
the sperm.
