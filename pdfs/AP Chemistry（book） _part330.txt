CHAPTER 2 Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
c.  
Anions derived by adding H+ to an oxyanion are named by adding as a prefix the word 
hydrogen or dihydrogen, as appropriate:
CO3
2-
carbonate ion
PO4
3-
phosphate ion
HCO3
-
hydrogen carbonate ion
H2PO4
-
dihydrogen phosphate ion
Notice that each H+ added reduces the negative charge of the parent anion by 
one. An older method for naming some of these ions uses the pre
