tant tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to
coastal economies.
Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too. As human coastal populations increase,
the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical
waters to become cloudy. At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator
species that eat corals to go unchecked.
Although a rise in global temperatures of 1–2˚C (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades
may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome. When change occurs rapidly, species can become
extinct before evolution leads to new adaptations. Many scientists believe that global warming, with its rapid
(in terms of evolutionary time) and inexorable increases in temperature, is tipping the balance beyond the
point at which many of the world’s coral reefs can recover.
What are the effects of global climate change and
