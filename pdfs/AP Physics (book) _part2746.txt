4–31). How much thicker is
the lens at the center than the edges?
51. (II) If the wedge between the glass plates of Example 24–10
is filled with some transparent substance other than air—
say, water—the pattern shifts because the wavelength 
of the light changes. In a material where the index of
refraction is n, the wavelength is 
where 
is the
wavelength in vacuum (Eq. 24–1). How many dark bands
would there be if the wedge of Example 24–10 were filled
with water?
52. (II) A fine metal foil separates one end of two pieces of
optically flat glass, as in Fig. 24–33. When light of wave-
length 670 nm is incident normally, 24 dark bands are
observed (with one at each end). How thick is the foil?
53. (II) How thick (minimum) should the air layer be between
two flat glass surfaces if the glass is to appear bright when
450-nm light is incident normally? What if the glass is to
appear dark?
