Carbides
The binary compounds of carbon with metals, metalloids, and certain nonmetals are 
called carbides. The more active metals form ionic carbides, and the most common of 
these contain the acetylide ion 1C2
2 -2. This ion is isoelectronic with N2, and its Lewis 
structure, 3:C ‚C:42 -, has a carbon–carbon triple bond. The most important ionic car-
bide is calcium carbide 1CaC22, produced by the reduction of CaO with carbon at high 
temperature:
 
2 CaO1s2 + 5 C1s2 ¡ 2 CaC21s2 + CO21g2 
[22.64]
The carbide ion is a very strong base that reacts with water to form acetylene 
1H¬C ‚C ¬H2:
 
CaC21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ Ca1OH221aq2 + C2H21g2 
[22.65]
Calcium carbide is therefore a convenient solid source of acetylene, which is used in weld-
ing (Figure 22.11).
Interstitial carbides are formed by many transition metals. The carbon atoms occupy 
open spaces (interstices) between the metal atoms in a manner analogous to the intersti-
