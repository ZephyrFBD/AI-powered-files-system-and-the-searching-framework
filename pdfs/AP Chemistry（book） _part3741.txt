Give It Some Thought
Why is the energy of the dxz and dyz orbitals in a square-planar complex lower than 
that of the dxy orbital?
Nickel(II) complexes in which the metal coordination number is 4 can have either square-planar or tetrahedral geometry. 
3NiCl442- is paramagnetic, and 3Ni(CN)442- is diamagnetic. One of these complexes is square planar, and the other is tetrahedral. 
Use the relevant crystal-field splitting diagrams in the text to determine which complex has which geometry.

SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two complexes containing Ni2+ and their 
magnetic properties. We are given two molecular geometry 
choices and ask
