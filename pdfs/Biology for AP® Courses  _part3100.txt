cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated in Figure 26.25. Myelinated axons
make up the “white matter” and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the “gray matter.” Gray matter is also composed of
interneurons, which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal
(facing the back of the animal) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell
bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the animal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the
brain to the body.
The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements—like automatically
removing a hand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the
knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a
motor neuron. While a ref
