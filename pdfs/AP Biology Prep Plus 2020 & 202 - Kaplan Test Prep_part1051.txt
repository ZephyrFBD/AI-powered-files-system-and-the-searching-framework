s
with shorter beaks. It would thus be reasonable to expect that average beak length will
increase over time. Only (C) indicates such an increase in mean length. (A) increases the
variability in beak size, which would not be the result with a selective pressure in only
one direction. (B) would be the result of selection for shorter beaks. (D) would result from
selection against both birds with shorter beaks and birds with longer beaks.
51. D
Current hypotheses state that life on Earth was preceded by the generation of the
precursors of life, such as amino acids and nucleotides. That generation thus took place
under abiotic conditions. Of the stated choices, the most reasonable conclusion is (D):
some of the amino acids from earlier meteorites may have served as precursors of life.
(A) implies that life on Earth originated on meteorites. This is a much stronger conclusion
than can safely be inferred from the limited data in the question stem. (B) might seem
tempting—aȇer all, there are
