The change in the momentum vector
is in the direction of the net force
NEWTON’S SECOND LAW
†Normally we think of 
as being a small time interval. If it is not small, then Eq. 7–2 is valid if 
is constant during that time interval, or if 
is the average net force during that time interval.

EXERCISE B If the water splashes back from the car in Example 7–2, would the force
on the car be larger or smaller?
Force of a tennis serve. For a top player, a ten-
nis ball may leave the racket on the serve with a speed of 
(about 
), Fig. 7–1. If the ball has a mass of 0.060 kg and is in contact with the
racket for about 4 ms
estimate the average force on the ball. Would
this force be large enough to lift a 60-kg person?
APPROACH We write Newton’s second law, Eq. 7–2, for the average force as
where 
and 
are the initial and final momenta. The tennis ball is hit when
its initial velocity 
is very nearly zero at the top
