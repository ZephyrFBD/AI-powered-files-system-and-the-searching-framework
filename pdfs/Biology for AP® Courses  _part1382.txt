Recessive lethal alleles are only lethal in homozygotes, but
dominant lethal alleles are fatal in heterozygotes as well.
12.3 Laws of Inheritance
Mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and
recessive pattern. Alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two
alleles present in a diploid individual. In addition, genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. That is,
alleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a particular allele of another gene. A dihybrid cross
demonstrates independent assortment when the genes in question are on different chromosomes or distant from each other
on the same chromosome. For crosses involving more than two genes, use the forked line or probability methods to predict
offspring genotypes and phenotypes rather than a Punnett square.
Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes duri
