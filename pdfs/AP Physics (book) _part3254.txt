This is very close to experimental values for small 
But for higher energies, the
curve (Fig. 29–17) begins to deviate from a perfect SHO curve, which affects
the wavelengths and frequencies of the transitions. Typical transition energies are
on the order of 
roughly 10 to 100 times larger than for rotational
transitions, with wavelengths in the infrared region of the spectrum 
Vibrational energy levels in hydrogen. Hydrogen mole-
cule vibrations emit infrared radiation of wavelength around 2300 nm. (a) What
is the separation in energy between adjacent vibrational levels? (b) What is the
lowest vibrational energy state?
APPROACH The energy separation between adjacent vibrational levels is
