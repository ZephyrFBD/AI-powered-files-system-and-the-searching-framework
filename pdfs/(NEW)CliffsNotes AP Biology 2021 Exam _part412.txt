Hybrid vigor (or heterosis) describes the superior quality of offspring resulting from crosses between two different
inbred strains of plants. The superior hybrid quality results from a reduction of loci with deleterious homozygous
recessive conditions and an increase in loci with heterozygote advantage. For example, a hybrid of corn, developed
by crossing two different corn strains that were highly inbred, is more resistant to disease and produces larger corn
ears than either of the inbred strains.
Frequency-dependent selection (or minority advantage) occurs when the least common phenotypes have a
selective advantage. Common phenotypes are selected against. However, since rare phenotypes have a selective
advantage, they soon increase in frequency and become common. Once they become common, they lose their
selective advantage and are selected against. With this type of selection, then, phenotypes alternate between low and
high frequencies, thus maintaining multiple phenotypes (po
