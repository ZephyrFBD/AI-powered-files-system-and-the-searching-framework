t affect the rate of transpiration. The investigation provides 
an opportunity for students to review and apply concepts and science practices they have 
studied previously, including cell structure and function, the movement of molecules 
across membranes, and the exchange of matter between biological systems and with their 
environment.
In  Investigation 12: Fruit Fly Behavior,  students use Drosophila 
melanogaster as a model organism to explore chemotaxis and other observed behaviors. 
The fruit fly has been studied in depth by the scientific community; its genome has been 
sequenced, its physical characteristics charted, and its meiotic and developmental processes 
carefully researched. Although students typically become familiar with Drosophila while 
studying genetics, the fly also has been the source for many historical experiments in 
animal behavior. In this investigation, students begin by listing when and where they 
notice fruit flies â€” in a bowl of fruit, on a picnic tabl
