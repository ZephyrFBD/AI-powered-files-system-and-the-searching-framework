a dormant state
that allows their survival. The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood. In a process called
resuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to “normal” life when environmental conditions improve.
Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic
waters are non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured
under laboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive?
Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of
DNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a
process called amplification.
The Ecology of Biofilms
Until a couple of decades ago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities
