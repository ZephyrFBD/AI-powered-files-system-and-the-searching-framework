er 33) states that the beginning
of the universe was accompanied by a huge burst of
photons. Those photons are still present today and make up
the so-called cosmic microwave background radiation.
The universe radiates like a blackbody with a temperature
today of about 2.7 K. Calculate the peak wavelength of this
radiation.
67. At low temperatures, nearly all the atoms in hydrogen gas
will be in the ground state. What minimum frequency photon
is needed if the photoelectric effect is to be observed?
68. A beam of 72-eV electrons is scattered from a crystal, as 
in X-ray diffraction, and a first-order peak is observed at
What is the spacing between planes in the
diffracting crystal? (See Section 25–11.)
69. A microwave oven produces electromagnetic radiation at
and produces a power of 720 W. Calculate the
number of microwave photons produced by the microwave
oven each second.
70. Sunlight reaching the Earth’s atmosphere has an intensity of
about
