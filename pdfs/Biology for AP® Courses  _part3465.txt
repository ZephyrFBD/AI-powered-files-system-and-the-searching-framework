of challenges for animals that are adapted to movement in water. The buoyancy
of water provides a certain amount of lift, and a common form of movement by fish is lateral undulations
of the entire body. This back and forth movement pushes the body against the water, creating forward
movement. In most fish, the muscles of paired fins attach to girdles within the body, allowing for some
control of locomotion. As certain fish began moving onto land, they retained their lateral undulation form of
locomotion (anguilliform). However, instead of pushing against water, their fins or flippers became points of
contact with the ground, around which they rotated their bodies.
The effect of gravity and the lack of buoyancy on land meant that body weight was suspended on the limbs,
leading to increased strengthening and ossification of the limbs. The effect of gravity also required changes
to the axial skeleton. Lateral undulations of land animal vertebral columns cause torsional strain. A firmer,
