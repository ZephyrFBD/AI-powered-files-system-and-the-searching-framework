The resistance R of a wire is inversely proportional to its
cross-sectional area A, and directly proportional to its length 
and to a property of the material called its resistivity:

CHAPTER 18
Electric Currents
1. When an electric cell is connected to a circuit, electrons flow
away from the negative terminal in the circuit. But within
the cell, electrons flow to the negative terminal. Explain.
2. When a flashlight is operated, what is being used up: bat-
tery current, battery voltage, battery energy, battery power,
or battery resistance? Explain.
3. What quantity is measured by a battery rating given in
