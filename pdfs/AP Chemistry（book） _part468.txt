excess reactants as leftovers. Suppose, for example, we have a mixture of 10 mol H2
and 7 mol O2, which react to form water:
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ยก 2 H2O1g2
Because 2 mol H2 ] 1 mol O2, the number of moles of O2 needed to react with all the H2 is
Moles O2 = 110 mol H22a1 mol O2
2 mol H2
b = 5 mol O2
Because 7 mol O2 is available at the start of the reaction, 7 mol O2 - 5 mol O2 = 2 mol O2 
is still present when all the H2 is consumed.
The reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction is called the limiting reactant 
because it determines, or limits, the amount of product formed. The other reactants are 
sometimes called excess reactants. In our example, shown in Figure 3.17, H2 is the limiting 
reactant, which means that once all the H2 has been consumed, the reaction stops. At 
that point some of the excess reactant O2 is left over.
There are no restrictions on the starting amounts of reactants in any reaction. Indeed, 
many reactions are carried out using an excess of one reactant. T
