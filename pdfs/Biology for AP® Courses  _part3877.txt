 which
allows the urea to be separated via active
transport down the concentration gradient.
c.
In the upper component, the dialysate has a
higher solute concentration than the blood,
which allows the urea to utilize facilitated
diffusion in order to diffuse to the lower
dialysate.
d.
In the upper component, the dialysate has a
lower solute concentration than the blood, which
allows the urea to diffuse to the lower dialysate
down its concentration gradient.

The diagram shows red blood cells in two different NaCl
solutions. What is likely causing the cells to differ in shape
in the two solutions?
