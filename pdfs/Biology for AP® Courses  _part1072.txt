signal transduction
signaling cell
signaling pathway
synaptic signal
target cell
chemical ligand that carries a signal from one nerve cell to the next
signal between nearby cells that is delivered by ligands traveling in the liquid medium in the space
between the cells
enzyme that removes the phosphate group from a molecule that has been previously phosphorylated
enzyme that degrades cAMP, producing AMP, to terminate signaling
method of cellular communication used by bacteria that informs them of the abundance of similar (or
different) bacteria in the environment
protein in or on a target cell that bind to ligands
small, non-protein molecule that propagates a signal within the cell after activation of a receptor
causes its release
interaction of signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors that merge to activate the same
response in the cell
propagation of the signal through the cytoplasm (and sometimes also the nucleus) of the cell
cell that releases signal
