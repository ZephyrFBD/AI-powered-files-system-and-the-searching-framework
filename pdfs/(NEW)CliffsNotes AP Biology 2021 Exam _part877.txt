egments together on the lagging strands of DNA during replication.
22. A. The germinating seeds are obtaining energy from stored nutrients through respiration. The Krebs cycle of
aerobic respiration releases
 
CO2. It is also true (but not listed as a possible answer) that CO2 is
 
released by fermentation, but most seeds are unlikely to germinate in the absence of oxygen since anaerobic
respiration supplies too little energy.
23. C. Enzymes are generally effective only within a certain range of temperatures. Above a certain temperature, the
secondary and tertiary structures of the enzymes (which are proteins) break down (denature) and become ineffective.
24. D. In figure VI, there are four haploid cells. (Each cell has one chromosome with two chromatids.) In figure VII,
there are eight haploid cells. (Each cell has one chromatid.) This is an example of mitosis because both parent and
daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes. Note that a chromosome can consist of one or two
