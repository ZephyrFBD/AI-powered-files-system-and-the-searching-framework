e a sharp, slightly acidic taste.
Although carbonic acid cannot be isolated, hydrogen carbonates (bicarbonates) and 
carbonates can be obtained by neutralizing carbonic acid solutions. Partial neutralization 
produces HCO3
-, and complete neutralization gives CO3
2 -. The HCO3
-  ion is a stronger 
base than acid 1Kb = 2.3 * 10 - 8; Ka = 5.6 * 10 - 112. The carbonate ion is much more 
strongly basic 1Kb = 1.8 * 10 - 42.
The principal carbonate minerals are calcite 1CaCO32, magnesite 1MgCO32, dolo-
mite 3MgCa1CO3224, and siderite 1FeCO32. Calcite is the principal mineral in limestone 
and the main constituent of marble, chalk, pearls, coral reefs, and the shells of marine 
animals such as clams and oysters. Although CaCO3 has low solubility in pure water, it 
dissolves readily in acidic solutions with evolution of CO2:
 
CaCO31s2 + 2 H+1aq2 âˆ† Ca2 +1aq2 + H2O1l2 + CO21g2 
[22.60]
Because water containing CO2 is slightly acidic (Equation 22.59), CaCO3 dissolves slowly 
in this medium:
