ver a different range of wavelengths. This allows the
cell to absorb a greater amount of the incident light energy than if there were only one lightabsorbing pigment.
2. After becoming energized in photosystem I, the electrons contribute to the formation of NADPH. Then, NADPH
passes those electrons to the Calvin cycle, where they contribute partly to the regeneration of RuBP (so the Calvin
cycle can repeat) and partly to the formation of carbohydrates.
3. The accumulation of protons in the thylakoid lumen creates a pH and electrical gradient across the thylakoid
membrane. The gradient drives the movement of protons through ATP synthase, which, in turn, drives the
phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.
A Typical Answer to Long Question
Question 1
Photosynthesis is the process by which water and light energy are used to fix inorganic carbon dioxide into glucose.
The complete equation is
 
6 H2O + 6 CO2 + light â†’ C6H12O6 + 6 O2
Various pigments exist in the photosynthetic membranes of plants. The
