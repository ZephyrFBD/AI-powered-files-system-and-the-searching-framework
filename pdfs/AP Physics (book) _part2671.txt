E 24–26 Spectra produced by
a grating: (a) two wavelengths, 400 nm and
700 nm; (b) white light. The second order
will normally be dimmer than the first
order. (Higher orders are not shown.) If the
grating spacing is small enough, the second
and higher orders will be missing.

EXERCISE D You are shown the spectra produced by red light shining through two 
different gratings. The maxima in spectrum A are farther apart than those in spectrum B.

24–7 The Spectrometer and Spectroscopy
A spectrometer or spectroscope, Fig. 24–27, is a device to measure wavelengths
accurately using a diffraction grating (or a prism) to separate different wavelengths
of light. Light from a source passes through a
