Bacteria interact by chemical signals among a colony.
The first life on our planet consisted of single-celled prokaryotic organisms that had limited interaction with
each other. While some external signaling occurs between different species of single-celled organisms, the
majority of signaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the same species. The
evolution of cellular communication is an absolute necessity for the development of multicellular organisms,
and this innovation is thought to have required approximately 2.5 billion years to appear in early life forms.
Yeasts are single-celled eukaryotes, and therefore have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more
complex life forms. Comparisons of the genomes of yeasts, nematode worms, fruit flies, and humans
illustrate the evolution of increasingly complex
