 (a) Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of PH3 and 
BCl3 if a solid sample of PH3BCl3 is placed in a closed ves-
sel at 80 °C and decomposes until equilibrium is reached. 
(b) If the flask has a volume of 0.250 L, what is the mini-
mum mass of PH3BCl31s2 that must be added to the flask 
to achieve equilibrium?
