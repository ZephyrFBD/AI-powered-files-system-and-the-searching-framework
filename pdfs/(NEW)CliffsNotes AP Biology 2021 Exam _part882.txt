ide the thylakoid (the
thylakoid space) compared
 
to the stroma.
 
35. C. Process III is the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle generates the three-carbon sugar, G3P. Two molecules of
G3P form glucose. The other
 
product of the Calvin cycle is NADP+, which, together with H+ from
 
the stroma, moves into the thylakoid membrane.
 
36. C. At the resting potential, the plasma membrane of a neuron is
polarized at –70 mV A stimulus causes Na+ voltage-gated channels to open, allowing Na+ to enter the cell,
depolarizing the membrane. If the stimulus is strong enough, enough Na+ will enter the cell to allow the
voltage to exceed the threshold voltage of –55mV (at end of stage A). Once the threshold voltage is exceeded, an
action potential is initiated,
 
causing the Na+ channels to fully open, resulting in a large
 
depolarization of the plasma membrane (stage B). Repolarization occurs
 
during stage C, as the K+ voltage-gated ion channels open, restoring the
 
polarization of the membrane to its
