Exercise asking them to return to the COQ to rethink and answer again.
4. Digital. Biggest of all. Crucial new applications. Today we are surrounded by
digital electronics. How does it work? If you try to find out, say on the
Internet, you won’t find much physics: you may find shallow hand-waving
with no real content, or some heavy jargon whose basis might take months or
years to understand. So, for the first time, I have tried to explain
• The basis of digital in bits and bytes, how analog gets transformed into
digital, sampling rate, bit depth, quantization error, compression, noise
(Section 17–10).
• How digital TV works, including how each pixel is addressed for each frame,
data stream, refresh rate (Section 17–11).
• Semiconductor computer memory, DRAM, and flash (Section 21–8).
• Digital cameras and sensors—revised and expanded Section 25–1.
• New semiconductor physics, some of which is used in digital devices,
including LED and OLED—how they wo
