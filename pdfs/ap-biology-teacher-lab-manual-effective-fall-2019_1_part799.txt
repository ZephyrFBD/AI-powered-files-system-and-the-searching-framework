ENZYME ACTIVITY*
How do abiotic or biotic factors influence the rates 
of enzymatic reactions? 
 
â– BACKGROUND
Enzymes are the catalysts of biological systems. They speed up chemical reactions in 
biological systems by lowering the activation energy, the energy needed for molecules 
to begin reacting with each other. Enzymes do this by forming an enzyme-substrate 
complex that reduces energy required for the specific reaction to occur. Enzymes have 
specific shapes and structures that dete
