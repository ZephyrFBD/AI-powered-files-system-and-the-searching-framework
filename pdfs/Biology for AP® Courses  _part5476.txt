years from present time we hit the Medieval Warm Period when
temperatures were higher than now without any industrialisation
and this was followed by the LiĴle Ice Age when temperatures
plummeted. The world was still emerging from these centuries of
serious cold when many climate records began which makes the
ever-repeated line of the ‘hoĴest year since records began’
meaningless when you are not comparing like with like. The coldest
period of the LiĴle Ice Age corresponded with the lowest period of
sunspot activity when the Sun was at its least active. Proper
scientists will not be at all surprised by this when it conﬁrms the
obvious fact that earth temperature is aﬀected by the scale of Sun
activity and the energetic power that it subsequently emits; but
when is the last time you heard a climate hoaxer talking about the
Sun as a source of earth temperature?? Everything has to be focussed
on Co2 which makes up just 0.117 percent of so-called greenhouse
gases and only a fractio
