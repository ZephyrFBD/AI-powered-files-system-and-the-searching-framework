ll dominate in the long term,
resulting in either the extinction of the competitor or a shiȇ toward a
diﬀerent ecological niche. In this case, however, both species were
able to coexist with each other immediately, and no change in
population or growth rate was observed. This means that the two
species are not in competition for resources and, therefore, must
occupy diﬀerent niches, eliminating (D). (B) is incorrect because it is
stated in the question stem that both the black-necked stilt and the
snowy plover are occupying the newly accessible coastal space and,
therefore, the same habitat. Given that the two birds do not share the
same genus, it is unlikely that the two species are closely related, as
suggested in (A). Rather, the species are more likely to be unrelated, as
in (C).

The frequencies of alleles in a Hardy-Weinberg population can be
determined using the following equations:
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
p + q = 1
Use A and a to represent the alleles for attached and unattached
