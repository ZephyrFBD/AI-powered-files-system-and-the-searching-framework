Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity
83. A banana contains about 420 mg of potassium, of which a
small fraction is the radioactive isotope 
(Appendix B).
Estimate the activity of an average banana due to 
84. When 
decays to 
what is the maximum kinetic energy of the
emitted electron? What is its minimum energy? What is
the energy of the neutrino in each case? Ignore recoil of
the daughter nucleus.
85. (a) In 
decay of, say, a 
nucleus, show that the
nucleus carries away a fraction 
of the total
energy available, where 
is the mass number of the
daughter nucleus. [Hint: Use conservation of momentum
as well as conservation of energy.] (b) Approximately what
percentage of the energy available is thus carried off by
the 
particle when 
decays?
