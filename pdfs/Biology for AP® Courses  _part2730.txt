 phloem. The positive pressure that is produced pushes water and solutes down
the pressure gradient. The sucrose is unloaded into the sink, and the water returns to the xylem vessels.
23.6 Plant Sensory Systems and Responses
Plants respond to light by changes in morphology and activity. Irradiation by red light converts the photoreceptor
phytochrome to its far-red light-absorbing form—Pfr. This form controls germination and flowering in response to length
of day, as well as triggers photosynthesis in dormant plants or those that just emerged from the soil. Blue-light receptors,
cryptochromes, and phototropins are responsible for phototropism. Amyloplasts, which contain heavy starch granules,
sense gravity. Shoots exhibit negative gravitropism, whereas roots exhibit positive gravitropism. Plant
hormones—naturally occurring compounds synthesized in small amounts—can act both in the cells that produce them and
in distant tissues and organs. Auxins are responsible for apical dominance, roo
