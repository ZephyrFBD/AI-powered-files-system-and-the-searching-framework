■ Timing and Length of Lab 
The first part of this investigation, Procedure, minimally involves growing one

seven weeks. Almost all days will be short, with students taking care of plants and 
making notes. Occasionally, more time (5-10 minutes) will be needed — for planting, 
quantifying variation and selection, pollinating plants, and scoring the second 
generation. 
The time needed to fully investigate questions generated by students in the second 
part of the investigation will need to be determined by you and your students. As in the 
first part, much of the work in the student-led part c
