drogen ion (H+)
concentrations in the taste neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled
receptor. These tastants bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.
Both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue
to decline. A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and
unappetizing.
