inear,
branched, or ring-type structures. Carbon is found in all types of macromolecules.
Oxygen and sulfur each have six valence electrons, and each of these elements typically forms two bonds.
Oxygen is found in all types of macromolecules. Sulfur is typically found in proteins.
Nitrogen and phosphorus each have five valence electrons, and each of these elements typically forms three
bonds. Nitrogen is found in nucleic acids and proteins. Phosphorus is found in nucleic acids and some lipids.
Hydrogen has one valence electron and forms a single bond. Hydrogen is found in all types of macromolecules.
In fact, hydrogen atoms are so ubiquitous that often they are not drawn in molecular structures.
TIP
While you do not need to know the structures of specific molecules for the AP Biology exam, you do need to be familiar with the different types of
structures and functions of macromolecules.
The structure and function of a macromolecule is determined by the types of monomers from which it i
