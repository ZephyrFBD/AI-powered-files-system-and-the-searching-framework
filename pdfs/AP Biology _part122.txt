imal cell, the extra water will lyse the cell. Although
choice D is swollen or turgid, it is a plant cell. (ENE-2)
(B) Signal transduction pathways greatly amplify a signal. See Figure
3.25, which shows the binding of a single molecule of epinephrine at
the GPCR with a total response of 108 molecules of glucose 1-
phosphate. (IST-3)
(D) Normally, estrogen binds with the intracellular estrogen receptor,
forming a complex that moves to the nucleus. Once there, the
complex causes transcription of genes and a cellular response. The
presence of BPA will interfere with this pathway by binding with
estrogen receptors. It may either illicit a response without estrogen
even being present, or BPA can block receptors and prevent an
estrogen response, even though estrogen is present. BPA is in a class
of chemicals known as estrogen pathway disruptors. (ENE-2)
(C) Apoptosis appears across the entire animal kingdom, not only in
“advanced” animals, whatever they are. Normally, apoptosis triggers
