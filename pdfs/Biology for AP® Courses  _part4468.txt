parental care for the chicks. A third explanation for the evolutionary
advantages of monogamy is the “female-enforcement hypothesis.” In this scenario, the female ensures that the male does
not have other offspring that might compete with her own, so she actively interferes with the male’s signaling to attract
other mates.

to its resource richness. The female benefits by mating with a dominant, genetically fit male; however, it is at the cost of
having no male help in caring for the offspring. An example is seen in the yellow-rumped honeyguide, a bird whose males
