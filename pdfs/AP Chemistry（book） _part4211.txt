Figure 11.2 The density in a liquid is much closer to a solid than 
it is to a gas. Figure 11.3 The distance within the molecule (the 
covalent bond distance) represented by the solid black line is smaller 
than the intermolecular distance represented by the red dotted 
line. Figure 11.5 The halogens are diatomic molecules and have 
much greater size and mass, and therefore greater polarizability, 
than the noble gases, which are monatomic. Figure 11.8 They 
stay roughly the same because the molecules have roughly the 
is highest, which is near the nucleus. Figure 6.18 For a single 
electron atom like hydrogen the energies of the orbitals are the same 
as the energies of the orbits in the Bohr model. Figure 6.19 There 
would be four maxima and three nodes. Figure 6.23 The px 
orbital. Figure 6.24 Ther
