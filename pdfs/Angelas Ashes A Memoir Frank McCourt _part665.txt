ming home, 
 
 Frankie? 
 
 No. 
 
 Ah, do, Frankie. Come on. 
 
 I live here now. I’m never going back. 
 
 But Malachy is gone to the army and you’re here and I have no big 
 
 brother.All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He’s not 
 
 even four and can’t talk right.

 I can’t go back. I’m never going back.You can come here any time 
 
 you like. 
 
 His eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart 
 
 I want to say,All right, I’ll come with you. I’m only saying that. I know 
 
 I’ll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don’t know if I can 
 
 look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his 
 
  
  
 shoe broken and clacking along the pavement.When I start that job at 
 
 the post office I’ll buy him shoes so I will. I’ll give him an egg and take 
 
 him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we’ll go 
 
 to Naughton’s and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a 
 
 mile.
