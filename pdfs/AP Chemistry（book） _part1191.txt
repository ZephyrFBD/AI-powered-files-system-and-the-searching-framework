 7.67  (a) Why is calcium generally more reactive than magnesium? 
(b) Why is calcium generally less reactive than potassium?
 7.68  Silver and rubidium both form +1 ions, but silver is far less 
reactive. Suggest an explanation, taking into account the 
ground-state electron conÔ¨Ågurations of these elements and 
their atomic radii.
