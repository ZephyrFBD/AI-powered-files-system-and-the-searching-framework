ar mass of the 
compound is required in order to determine molecular formula when 
the empirical formula is known. 10.122 (a) NH3(g) remains after

(b) ClO2 is very reactive because it is an odd-electron molecule. Add-
ing an electron pairs the odd electron and completes the octet of Cl. 
ClO2 has a strong tendency to gain an electron and be reduced.

11.1 (a) The diagram best describes a liquid. (b) In the diagram, 
particles are close together, mostly touching, but there is no regular 
arrangement or order. This rules out a gaseous sample, where the par-
ticles are far apart, and a crystalline solid, which has a regular repeat-
ing structure in all three directions. 11.4 In its ﬁnal state, methane is 
a gas at 185 °C. 11.6
