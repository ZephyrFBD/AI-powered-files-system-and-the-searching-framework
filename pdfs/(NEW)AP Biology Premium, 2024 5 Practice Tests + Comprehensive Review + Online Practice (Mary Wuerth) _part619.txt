(a) Explain the type of selection that was performed in this experiment.
(b) Using the axes provided, construct a graph of the data, showing the means and 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Using the graph you constructed in part (b), analyze the data, and determine whether there is a statistically
significant difference in the mean plant height on day 10 between Generation 1 and Generation 2.
(d) On day 10 of Generation 2, the 10 shortest plants are allowed to continue to grow to flowering. These 10
plants are cross-pollinated, and their seeds are collected and planted to create Generation 3. Predict the
mean plant height for Generation 3 on day 10. Justify your prediction.

1. (B) Total water potential is the sum of the pressure potential and the solute potential. Since the beaker is open to
the atmosphere and in equilibrium with the atmospheric pressure, the pressure potential on the sugar beet cube
