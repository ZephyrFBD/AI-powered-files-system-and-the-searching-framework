Which of the following is an implication of Thomson’s observation that the type 
of metal used to make the cathode does not matter? (a) The cathode rays do not 
originate in the cathode. (b) The particles that make up cathode rays must be 
present in all metals.
Once the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron was known, measuring either quan-
tity allowed scientists to calculate the other. In 1909, Robert Millikan (1868–1953) of the 
University of Chicago succeeded in measuring the charge of an electron by  
performing 
the experiment described in Figure 2.5. He then calculated the mass of the electron by 
using his experimental value for the charge, 1.602 * 10-19 C, and Thomson’s charge- 
to-mass ratio, 1.76 * 108 C>g:
Electron mass = 1.602 * 10-19 C
1.76 * 108 C>g
= 9.10 * 10-28 g
This result agrees well with the currently accepted value for the electron mass, 
9.10938 * 10-28 g. This mass is about 2000 times smaller than that of hydrogen, the 
lightest atom.
