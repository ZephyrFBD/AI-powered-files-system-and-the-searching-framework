Maxwell’s comprehensive and successful theory of electromagnetism (Chapter 22)
predicted that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s equations gave the
velocity of light c as 
and this is just what is measured. The
question then arose: in what reference frame does light have precisely the value
predicted by Maxwell’s theory? It was assumed that light would have a different
speed in different frames of reference. For example, if observers could travel 
on a rocket ship at a speed of 
away from a source of light, we
might expect them to measure the speed of the light reaching them to be 
But Maxwell’s equations
have no provision for relative velocity. They predicted the speed of light to be
which seemed to imply that there must be some preferred
reference frame where c would have this value.
We discussed in Chapters 11 and 12 that waves can travel on water and along
ropes or strings, and sound waves travel in air and other materials. Ninete
