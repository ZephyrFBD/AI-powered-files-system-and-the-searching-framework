What is the most likely hypothesis for why the most species
diversity is found in the tropics rather than in the temperate regions
of the world?
The food chains are longer in the tropics because of all the
available sunlight, and thus the tropics can support more life.
The tropics have the highest temperatures, which cause a faster
rate of mutation and speciation.
The tropics were the first region to separate away from
Pangaea.
The tropics have the most direct sunlight and the most rain.
The frequency of a particular allele in a population of 1,000 birds in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is 0.3. If the population remains in
equilibrium, what would be the expected frequency of that allele
after 500 years?
It will increase if the allele is favorable, or it will decrease if it
is unfavorable for individuals in that population.
Not enough information is provided to determine if the
frequency of the allele will remain the same or change.
The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because t
