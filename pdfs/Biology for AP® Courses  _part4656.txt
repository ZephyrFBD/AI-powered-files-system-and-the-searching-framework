riods
in the oceans, underground, and as ice. Figure 37.14 illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may
spend in the Earth’s major water reservoirs. Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule
stays in a particular reservoir. A large amount of the Earth’s water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice, beneath the
ground, and in the ocean, and, thus, is unavailable for short-term cycling (only surface water can evaporate).
Figure 37.14 This graph shows the average residence time for water molecules in the Earth’s water reservoirs.
There are various processes that occur during the cycling of water, shown in Figure 37.15. These processes include the
following:
•
evaporation/sublimation
•
condensation/precipitation
•
subsurface water flow
•
surface runoff/snowmelt
•
streamflow
The water cycle is driven by the sun’s energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters. This leads to the evaporation
(water to water vapor) of liqu
