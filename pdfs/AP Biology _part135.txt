INTERPHASE
Interphase consists of G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), and G2 (Gap 2). The G1
phase is a period of intense growth and biochemical activity. S stands for
the synthesis or replication of DNA. G2 is the phase when the cell
continues to grow and to complete preparations for cell division. More
than 90 percent of the life of a cell is spent in interphase. When a cell is in
interphase, it is not dividing, but it is very active. The chromatin is
threadlike, not condensed. Within the nucleus are one or more nucleoli. A
single centrosome, consisting of two centrioles, may be seen in the
cytoplasm of an animal cell. The centrosome is duplicated during S phase.
At the G2-M transition, the two centrosomes separate from one another
and move to opposite poles. Plant cells lack centrosomes but have
microtubule organizing centers, MTOCs, that serve the same function.
See Figure 4.3, which shows an animal cell during interphase.
