 products could escape the core. As an added safety precaution, 
the reactor is surrounded by a reinforced concrete containment shell to shield personnel 
and nearby residents from radiation and to protect the reactor from external forces. After 
passing through the reactor core, the very hot primary coolant passes through a heat 
exchanger where much of its heat is transferred to a secondary coolant, converting the lat-
ter to high-pressure steam that is used to drive a turbine. The secondary coolant is then 
condensed by transferring heat to an external source of water, such as a river or lake. The 
cooling systems of nuclear power plants are necessary for proper and safe operation. The
