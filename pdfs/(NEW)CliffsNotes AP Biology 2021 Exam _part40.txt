ons between atoms are shared, which means that neither atom completely
retains possession of the electrons (as happens with atoms that form strong ionic bonds). Covalent bonds occur when
the electronegativities of the atoms are similar.
Nonpolar covalent bonds form when electrons are shared equally. When the two atoms sharing electrons are
identical, such
 
as in oxygen gas (O2), the electronegativities are identical, and
both atoms pull equally on the electrons.
Polar covalent bonds form when electrons are shared unequally. Atoms in this kind of bond have
electronegativities that are different, and an unequal distribution of the electrons results. The electrons forming the
bond are closer to the atom with the greater electronegativity and produce a negative charge, or pole, near that atom.
The area around the atom with the weaker pull on the
electrons produces a positive pole. In a molecule of water (H2O),
for example, electrons are shared between the oxygen atom and each hydrogen ato
