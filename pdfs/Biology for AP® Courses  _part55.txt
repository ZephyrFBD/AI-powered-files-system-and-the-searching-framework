3.C.2. Biological systems have multiple processes that
increase genetic variation.
11.2, 13.1, 14.1, 14.6, 15.2, 17.1, 20.3, 21.2,
22.4
3.C.3. Viral replication results in genetic variation, and viral
infection can introduce genetic variation into the hosts.

Enduring understanding 3.D. Cells communicate by
generating, transmitting and receiving chemical signals
Chapter/Key Concepts
3.D.1. Cell communication processes share common features
that reflect a shared evolutionary history.
4.6, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 10.4, 37.2, 37.3
3.D.2. Cells communicate with each other through direct
contact with other cells or from a distance via chemical
signaling.
9.1, 9.3
3.D.3. Signal transduction pathways link signal reception with
cellular response.
9.1, 9.2
