ransformation efficiency =  
Total number of colonies growing on the agar plate 
Amount of DNA spread on the LB/amp plate (in μg) 
4. What does this mean? 
Transformation efficiency calculations result in very large, and very small, numbers. 
For both very large and very small numbers, scientists often use a mathematical 
shorthand referred to as scientific notation. For example, if the calculated 
transformation efficiency is 1,000 bacteria/μg of DNA, they often report this as 
transformants/μg. 
How would scientists report 10,000 transformants/μg in scientific notation? 
Suppose scientists calculated an efficiency of 5,000 bacteria/μg of DNA. How would 
they report this in scientific notation? 
a. Report your calculated transformation efficiency in scientific notation. 
b. What does your calculation of transformation efficiency mean? 
c. Biotechnologists generally agree that the transformation protocol that you have 
just completed has a transformation efficiency of between 8.0 x 102
