(A) Higher visibility allowed sticklebacks to 
increase their food consumption to make 
armor production easier. 
(B) Higher visibility made the sticklebacks more 
susceptible to large-toothed predators in the 
lakes, giving complete armor a selective 
advantage. 
(C) Clearer water allowed sunlight to penetrate to 
deeper depths, so the sticklebacks had to 
increase the amount of armor to protect 
themselves from the resulting increase in 
water temperature. 
(D) Clearer water contained fewer of the 
molecular building blocks needed for  
armor production, so sticklebacks showed  
a reduction in the amount of armor. 
 
19. Evolution of a new trait typically takes many 
generations. Yet a dramatic shift in the extent of 
armor plating in the Lake Washington stickleback 
population occurred in the 50 years following the 
cleanup of the lake. Which of the following best 
describes the mechanism of the rapid evolution of 
the armor phenotype in the Lake Washington 
sticklebacks? 
(A)
