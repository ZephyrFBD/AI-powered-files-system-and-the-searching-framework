(C) The definition of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is that the allelic
frequencies will not change. If one trait becomes advantageous and
the allelic frequency changes, then the population is no longer in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
(D) Choice D is correct because painting the surface of most of the
leaves with nail polish will cover the stomates and prevent
transpiration, which is shown in Line C. Green plants reflect green
light; they do not absorb it and cannot use it as an energy source.
Placing a plastic bag over the leaves will decrease transpiration,
resulting in Line C. Placing a fan near the plant will increase
transpiration, causing Line A.
(B) Choice A is not correct because water moves up a tree in the
xylem via passive transport with the help of transpiration pull.
Choice C is not correct because the movement of water up a tree can
rise hundreds of meters. Choice D is not correct because the higher
the humidity, the slower the rate of transpir
