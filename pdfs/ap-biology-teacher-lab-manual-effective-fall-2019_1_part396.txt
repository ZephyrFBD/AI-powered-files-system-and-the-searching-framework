rocess of cellular respiration. Several questions about cellular 
respiration should emerge, including the following: 
•  When does it occur? Are there any situations when living cells are not respiring? 
•  Why might some living cells respire more than others? 
•  Are there differences between major groups of organisms in how fast they respire? 
•  What is the difference, if any, in the rate cellular respiration in germinating seeds 
versus nongerminating seeds? 
•  Does the temperature of germinating seeds affect the rate of cellular respiration? Do 
plant seeds consume more oxygen at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures?

•  Do germinating seeds just starting to germinate consume oxygen at a greater rate 
than seeds that have been germinating for several days (age dependence)? 
•  Do seeds, such as Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds (which store energy as oil), respire at a 
different rate from small
