7. Sex determination in birds follows the ZW system, where males have two copies of the Z chromosome (ZZ) and
females are heterozygous (ZW). A male bird (who is heterozygous for a trait on the Z chromosome) is mated
with a female bird (who expresses the recessive phenotype for that trait). Which of the following best describes
their most likely offspring?
(A) 25% males with the dominant phenotype, 25% males with the recessive phenotype, 25% females with the
dominant phenotype, and 25% females with the recessive phenotype
(B) all males with the domin
