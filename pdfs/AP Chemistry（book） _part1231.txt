The energy released by the attraction between ions of unlike charge more than makes 
up for the endothermic nature of ionization energies, making the formation of ionic 
compounds an exothermic process. The strong attractions also cause most ionic 
materials to be hard and brittle with high melting points—for example, NaCl melts 
at 801 °C.
The magnitude of the lattice energy of an ionic solid depends on the charges of 
the i
