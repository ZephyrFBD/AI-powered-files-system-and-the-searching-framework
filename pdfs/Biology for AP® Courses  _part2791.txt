112. By increasing the photosynthetic surface area, a plant
increases the rate of capture of free energy. For every
carbon atom fixed into carbohydrates, between 200 and
400 water molecules are released through stomata to the

atmosphere. A simple geometric model can be used to
estimate the minimum number of leaves on a tree, as
shown.

A. Identify and justify the data needed to describe the
relationship between the free energy captured and the
water transpired by a tree with dimensions D, L, and W.
Use these data to construct a mathematical model of the
relationship between transpiration rate and the rate of free
energy captured when a single carbon atom is fixed.
The diversity of vascular plants decreases with increasing
latitude. Equatorial ecosystems have greater pl
