Some eukaryotic organelles have internal membranes that are folded (for example, the inner membrane of the
mitochondria), which provides greater surface area on which reactions can occur in the organelle. While prokaryotic
cells do not have membrane-bound organelles, prokaryotes can fold their plasma membranes to get more surface
area on which to perform metabolic processes.
The Importance of Surface Area to Volume Ratios
Living systems need to efficiently eliminate waste products, absorb nutrients, and exchange chemicals and energy
with their environment. The ratio of a cell’s surface area to its volume is a key factor in determining the cell’s ability
to accomplish these tasks. The larger a cell’s surface area to volume ratio, the more efficiently the cell can
accomplish these tasks.
For example, first consider a cell with a spherical shape. The volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its
radius, as shown in the following formula:
