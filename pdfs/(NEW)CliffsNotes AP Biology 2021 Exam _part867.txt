2. Most plants obtain energy for metabolism and growth from photosynthesis. Design a controlled experiment to
investigate the source of energy for germinating seeds when light is not available.
a. Propose a hypothesis for how energy is obtained by a germinating seed and provide an explanation.
b. Describe a controlled experiment to test your hypothesis. Include an identification of independent, dependent, and
control variables.
c. Describe the results you would expect to obtain if the experiment was performed.
d. Graph your expected results on the axes provided below.
e. Provide an alternate hypothesis, or another explanation that would explain the
