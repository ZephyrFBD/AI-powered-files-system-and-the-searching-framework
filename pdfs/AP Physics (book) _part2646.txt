laced by light of wavelength 700 nm? (b) What happens
instead if the wavelength stays at 500 nm but the slits are moved farther apart?
RESPONSE (a) When increases in Eq. 24–2a but d stays the same, the angle 
for bright fringes increases and the interference pattern spreads out. (b) Increasing
the slit spacing d reduces for each order, so the lines are closer together.
From Eqs. 24–2 we can see that, except for the zeroth-order fringe at the
center, the position of the fringes depends on wavelength. When white light falls
on the two slits, as Young found in his experiments, the central fringe is white, but
the first (and higher) order fringes contain a spectrum of colors like a rainbow.
