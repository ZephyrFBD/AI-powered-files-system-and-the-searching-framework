mediated immunity.
4.
Both immune responses result in the creation of a line of memory cells (B and/or
T and/or lymphocytes).
5.
In the secondary immune response, antibody titer is higher than in the primary immune
response.
6.
In the secondary immune response, antibody production is swifter than in the primary
immune response.
7.
The secondary immune response is usually rapid enough to prevent disease onset;
the primary immune response is often too sluggish to prevent disease onset.
8.
The secondary immune response utilizes a line of memory cells (B-memory and T-
memory); the primary immune response does not (or a statement that the primary
immune response produces memory cells that the secondary immune response
utilizes).
9.
In the secondary immune response, the number of B-cells capable of recognizing the
antigen is much greater than in the primary immune response.
10.
The secondary immune response lasts longer than the primary immune response.
11.
In the secondary immune response,
