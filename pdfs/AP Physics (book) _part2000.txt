18–8 Microscopic View of Electric Current
It can be useful to analyze a simple model of electric current at the microscopic
level of atoms and electrons. In a conducting wire, for example, we can imagine the
free electrons as moving about randomly at high speeds, bouncing off the atoms of
the wire (somewhat like the molecules of a gas—Sections 13–8 to 13–10). When
an electric field exists in the wire, Fig. 18–24, the electrons feel a force and initially
begin to accelerate. But they soon reach a more or less steady average velocity
known as their drift velocity,
(collisions with atoms in the wire keep them from
accelerating further). The drift velocity is normally very much smaller than the
electrons’ average random speed.
We can relate 
to the macroscopic current I in the wire. In a time 
the
electrons will travel a distance
on average. Suppose the wire has cross-
sectional area A. Then in time
