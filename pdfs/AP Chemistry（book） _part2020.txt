the major 
factors affecting solubility: the kinds of 
intermolecular forces between solvent and 
solute molecules, and temperature. Most 
solids are more soluble in water at higher 
temperatures, whereas gases are less 
soluble in water at higher temperatures. The 
solubility of gases in a liquid increases with 
increasing pressure.
 13.4 ▶  Expressing Solution 
Concentration Examine the common 
ways of expressing the concentration of a 
solute in a solvent: mass percentage, mole 
fraction, molarity, and molality.
 13.5 ▶  Colligative Properties  Observe 
that some physical properties of solutions 
depend only on the concentration of the 
solute and not its identity. These colligative 
properties include vapor-pressure lowering, 
boiling-point elevation, and freezing-point 
depression, as well as osmotic pressure.
 13.6 ▶  Colloids Investigate colloids, mixtures 
that are not true solutions but consist of 
a solute-like phase (the dispersed phase) 
and a solvent-like phase (the disper
