tion 22–2). In Fig.24–54 the motion of the charges is resolved into two compo-
nents. An observer at right angles to the direction of the sunlight, as shown, will
see plane-polarized light because no light is emitted along the line of the other
component of the oscillation. (When viewing along the line of an oscillation, you
don’t see that oscillation, and hence see no waves made by it.) At other viewing
angles, both components will be present; one will be stronger, however, so the
light appears partially polarized. Thus, the process of scattering explains the
polarization of skylight.
Scattering of light by the Earth’s atmosphere depends on wavelength 
For
particles much smaller than the wavelength of light (such as molecules of air), the
particles will be less of an obstruction to long wavelengths than to short ones. The
scattering decreases, in fact, as 
Blue and violet light are thus scattered much
more than red and orange, which is why the sky looks blue. At sunset, the Sun’s rays
