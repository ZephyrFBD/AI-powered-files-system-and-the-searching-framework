w of Photosynthesis, photosynthesis forms an energy link with cellular respiration. Plants need
both photosynthesis and respiration in order to conduct metabolic processes during both light and dark times. Therefore,
plant cells contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts and learning objectives outlined
in Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The learning objectives listed in
the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more
of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
