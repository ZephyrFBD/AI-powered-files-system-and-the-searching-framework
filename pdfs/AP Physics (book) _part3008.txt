is called the work function, and is a few
electron volts 
for most metals. If the frequency f of the
incoming light is so low that hf is less than 
then the photons will not have
enough energy to eject any electrons at all. If
then electrons will be
ejected and energy will be conserved in the process. That is, the input energy (of
the photon), hf, will equal the outgoing kinetic energy 
of the electron plus the
energy required to get it out of the metal, W:
