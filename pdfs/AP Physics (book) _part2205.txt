1. Magnetic field produced by 
Wrap fingers around wire 
Fingers curl in direction of 
current 
with thumb pointing in 
(RHR-1)
direction of current I

2. Force on electric current I
Fingers first point straight 
Thumb points in direction 
due to magnetic field 
along current I, then bend 
of the force 
(RHR-2)
along magnetic field

Stopping charged particles. An electric
charge q moving in an electric field 
can be decelerated to a stop if the force
(Eq. 16–5) acts in the direction opposite to the charge’s velocity. Can
a magnetic field be used to stop a charged particle?
RESPONSE No, because the force is always perpendicular
