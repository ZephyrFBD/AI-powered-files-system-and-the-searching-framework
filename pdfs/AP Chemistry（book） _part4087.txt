ons and Y- anions. (b) HX has 
the smallest Ka value. It has most neutral acid molecules and few-
est ions. (c) HX has fewest H+ and highest pH. 16.11 (a) Molecule 
(b) is more acidic because its conjugate base is resonance-stabilized 
and the ionization equilibrium favors the more stable products. 
(b) Increasing the electronegativity of X increases the strength of 
both acids. As X becomes more electronegative and attracts more 
electron density, the O¬ H bond becomes weaker, more polar, and 
more likely to be ionized. An electronegative X group also stabilizes 
the anionic conjugate bases by delocalizing the negative charge. 
The equilibria favor products and the values of Ka increase. 16.13 
HCl is the Brønsted–Lowry acid; NH3 is the Brønsted–Lowry base.
