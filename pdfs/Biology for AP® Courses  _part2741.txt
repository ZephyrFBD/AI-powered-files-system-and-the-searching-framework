ic cells
are in the maturation zone.
28. Selective uptake of minerals in the root is measured
and the results are analyzed. If you analyze the data, what
should you see?
a.
Pericycle is the tissue where selectivity takes
place.
b.
The endodermis acts as a selective barrier for
minerals taken up by the root.
c.
The epidermis acts as a selective barrier for
minerals.
d.
The root cap functions as a selective barrier for
minerals taken up by the root.
29. Sudan Red dye stains primarily waxy, hydrophobic
material. A root is soaked in Sudan Red and analyzed for
stain retention. What is a scientist observing sections of
the root under a microscope likely to see?
a.
The cells in the cortex show the deepest stain.
b.
The tracheids in the xylem contain mostly lipid
droplets stained with Sudan Red.
c.
The Casparian strip will show the deepest
coloring.
d.
The sieve elements in the phloem show staining
with Sudan Red because of transported oil
droplets.
30. In environments where light is scarce, s
