 of coenzymes, cofactors, activators, and inhibitors. Inhibitors,
coenzymes, and cofactors can act competitively by binding to the enzyme’s active site, or noncompetitively by binding to
the enzyme’s allosteric site. An allosteric site is an alternate part of the enzyme that can bind to non–substrate molecules.
Enzymes work most efficiently under optimal conditions that are specific to the enzyme. For example, trypsin, an enzyme in
the human small intestine, works most efficiently at pH 8, whereas pepsin in the stomach works best under acidic conditions.
Sometimes environmental factors, especially low pH and high temperatures, alter the shape of the active site; if the shape
cannot be restored, the enzyme denatures. The most common method of enzyme regulation in metabolic pathways is via
feedback inhibition.
How can various factors, such as feedback inhibition, regulate enzyme activity?
