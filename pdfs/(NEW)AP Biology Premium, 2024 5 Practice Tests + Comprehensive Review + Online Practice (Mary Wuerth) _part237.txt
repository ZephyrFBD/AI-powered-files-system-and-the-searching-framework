effects on cells. Since receptors are specific
to certain ligands, a mutation in a gene that is coding for a receptor protein could result in a change in shape of the
receptor such that it would no longer bind to its specific ligand. Without a functional receptor for the ligand, the cell
with the mutated receptor protein would no longer be able to respond to the ligand. Examples of disorders caused by
mutations in receptor proteins include androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), in which the receptor for testosterone
is nonfunctional in gonadal tissue (causing it not to form into gonads during embryonic development), and
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), in which portions of the structure of the kidneys are insensitive to antidiuretic
hormone (ADH) and urine production is affected.
Signal transduction pathways may also be disrupted when molecules in the environment interfere with a ligandâ€™s
ability to bind to its receptor. For example, the cholera toxin binds to G-protein-coupled re
