ors and/or activators to increase gene expression.
2.
Operons generally occur in bacterial genomes and are sets of
genes that perform a biological function like metabolizing
lactose. When the substrate is absent, a repressor binds to the
operator to inhibit transcription of the operon, and when
present, the substrate binds to the repressor and induces
transcription.
3.
Though each contains the same set of genetic material, cells in
multicellular organisms have specific and diﬀerent functions.
The regulation of gene expression causes cells to undergo
diﬀerentiation and specialization.
4.
Intercellular and intracellular signals regulate gene expression.
For example, in embryos of multicellular organisms, the

concentration of morphogens determines spatial organization
of tissues and organs.
