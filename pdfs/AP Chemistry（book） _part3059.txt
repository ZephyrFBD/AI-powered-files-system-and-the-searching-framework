tween 
the gravitational potential-energy change 
of a boulder rolling down a hill and the 
free-energy change in a spontaneous 
reaction. Free energy always decreases in 
a spontaneous process when pressure and 
temperature are held constant.
Give It Some Thought
What are the criteria for spontaneity
(a) in terms of entropy and
(b) in terms of free energy?
This is a good time to remind ourselves of the significance of the reaction quotient, 
Q, for a system that is not at equilibrium. 
 (Section 15.6) Recall that when Q 6 K, there 
is an excess of reactants relative to products, and the reaction proceeds spontaneously in 
the forward direction to reach equilibrium, as noted in Figure 19.15. When Q 7 K, the 
reaction proceeds spontaneously in the reverse direction. At equilibrium Q = K.
Go Figure
Why are the spontaneous processes shown sometimes said to be 
“downhill” in free energy?
