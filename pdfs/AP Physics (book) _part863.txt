ositely directed downward 
angular momentum of the platform (Fig. 8–31b), so the total vector angular
momentum remains zero. Even though the person exerts a force (and torque) 
on the platform, the platform exerts an equal and opposite torque on the person.
So the net torque on the system of person plus platform is zero (ignoring 
friction), and the total angular momentum remains constant.

EXERCISE E In Example 8–16, what if he moves the axis only 90° so it is horizontal?
(a) The same direction and speed as above; (b) the same as above, but slower; (c) the
opposite result.
EXERCISE F Suppose you are standing on the edge of a large freely rotating turntable.
If you walk toward the center, (a) the turntable slows down; (b) the turntable speeds up;
(c) its rotation speed is unchanged; (d) you need to know the walking speed to answe
