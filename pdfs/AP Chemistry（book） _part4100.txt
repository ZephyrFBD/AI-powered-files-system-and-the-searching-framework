 to form H2CO31aq2. 
The basic pH of the ocean encourages ionization of H2CO31aq2 to 
form HCO-
31aq2 and CO3
2 -1aq2. Under the correct conditions, car-
bon is removed from the ocean as CaCO31s2 (sea shells, coral, chalk 
cliffs). As carbon is removed, more CO21g2 dissolves to maintain 
the balance of complex and interacting acid-base and precipitation 
equilibria. 18.9 Above ground, evaporation of petroleum gases and 
hydrogen sulﬁde at the well head, evaporation of volatile petroleum 
products and organic compounds from waste ponds, as well as leak-
age and overﬂow from the ponds are potential sources of contamina-
tion. Below ground, petroleum gases and fracking liquid can migrate 
into groundwater, both deep and shallow aquifers. 18.11 (a) Its tem-
