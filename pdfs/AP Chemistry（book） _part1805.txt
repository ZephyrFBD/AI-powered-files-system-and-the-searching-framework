high surface tensions 
compared with other substances of comparable molecular 
weights. (a) Draw the Lewis structures for these three com-
pounds. (b) What structural property do these substances 
have in common, and how might that account for the high 
surface tensions?

 (a) From ethanol to propanol to n-butanol the boiling 
points, surface tensions, and viscosities all increase. What 
is the reason for this increase? (b) How do you explain 
the fact that propanol and ethylene glycol have similar 
molecular weights (60 versus 62 amu), yet the viscosity of 
ethylene glycol is
