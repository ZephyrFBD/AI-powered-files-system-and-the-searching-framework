iends or family. They might limit
access to a car or even turn oﬀ their phone. All of this might be done
by physically holding them against their will, but is oĞen
accomplished through psychological abuse and intimidation. The
more isolated a person feels, the fewer resources they have to help
gain perspective on their situation and to escape from it. [No words
necessary.]
Economic abuse: Abusers oĞen make their partners beholden to
them for money by controlling access to funds of any kind. They
might prevent their partner from geĴing a job or withhold access to
money they earn from a job. This creates ﬁnancial dependency that
makes leaving the relationship very diﬃcult. [See destruction of
livelihoods and the proposed meagre ‘guaranteed income’ so long as
you do whatever you are told.]
Using children: An abuser might disparage their partner’s
parenting skills, tell their children lies about their partner, threaten
to take custody of their children, or threaten to harm their children.
