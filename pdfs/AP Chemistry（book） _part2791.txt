A solution contains 1.0 * 10-2 M Ag+1aq2 and 2.0 * 10-2 M Pb2 +1aq2. When Cl-1aq2 is added, both AgCl 
1Ksp = 1.8 * 10-102 and PbCl2 1Ksp = 1.7 * 10-52 can precipitate. What concentration of Cl-1aq2 is necessary to begin the 
precipitation of each salt? Which salt precipitates first?
Sample Exercise 17.17 
Selective Precipitation
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the concentration of Cl-1aq2 
necessary to begin the precipitation from a solution containing 
Ag+1aq2 and Pb2 +1aq2 ions, and to predict which metal chloride 
will begin to precipitate first.
Plan We are given Ksp values for the two precipitates. Using these 
and the metal ion concentrations, we can calculate what Cl-1aq2 
concentration is necessary to precipitate each salt. The salt requir-
ing the lower Cl-1aq2 ion concentration precipitates first.
Solve For AgCl we have Ksp = 3Ag+43Cl-4 = 1.8 * 10-10.
Because 3Ag+4 = 1.0 * 10-2 M, the greatest concentration of 
Cl-1aq2 that can be present without causing precipit
