Continuation of Plant Defenses Against Environmental Threats
Infection
IV.
Solution:
Synthesis of anti-microbial compounds, aka phytoalexins,
aka stress metabolites, and pathogenesis-related
(PR) proteins after infection
Chemical/physical barriers to pathogens
Examples/Structures:
Phytoalexin synthesis in a variety of plant groups:
Members of the Solanaceae and the Malvaceae
produce sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins
Members of the Brassica produce indole ring-based
phytoalexins
Members of the Leguminosae produce
isoflavonoid and polyacetylene phytoalexins
Orchids produce dihydrophenanthrene phytoalexins
Grapes produce resveratrol
Arabidopsis produces camalexin
Any plant displaying suberin deposition and localized
necrosis at a wound site (prevents penetr
