Brownian motion. In 1905, Einstein developed an equation for the 
average square of the displacement of a colloidal particle, a historically very important 
development. As you might expect, the larger the colloidal particle, the shorter its mean 
free path in a given liquid (Table 13.6). Today, the understanding of Brownian motion is 
applied to diverse problems in everything from cheese-making to medical imaging.
Our blood contains the complex protein hemoglobin, which car-
ries oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body. In the genetic 
disease sickle-cell anemia, hemoglobin molecules are abnormal and 
have a lower solubility in water, especially in their unoxygenated 
form. Consequently, as much as 85% of the hemoglobin in red blood 
cells crystallizes out of solution.
The cause of the insolubility is a structural change in one part 
of an amino acid. Normal hemoglobin molecules contain an amino 
acid that has a Â¬CH2CH2COOH group:
