Remember, the median is the middle number, so it’s best to put the data in order first.

The median of group A is 8, and the median of group B is 4.
The mode is the most frequent value. For group A, this is 8. For group B, the mode is 4.
(b) ​ Standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. The sample size is five
for both group A and group B because five pictures were taken for each slide. Because the standard error of
group A is larger than that of group B and because the two groups have the same sample size, the standard
deviation of group A must also be larger than that of group B. Note that this may or may not be the case if the
sample sizes were different. A larger standard deviation means the data is more variable, so you can conclude
that the data from group A has a larger spread than the data from group B.
(c) ​ As with most datasets, the researcher is assuming the data fits a normal distribution
