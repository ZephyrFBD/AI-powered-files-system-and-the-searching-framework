the boundary point oscillates at that frequency. Thus if the transmitted wave has a
lower speed, its wavelength is also less 
For a two or three dimensional wave, such as a water wave, we are concerned
with wave fronts, by which we mean all the points along the wave forming the wave
crest (what we usually refer to simply as a “wave” at the seashore). A line drawn in
the direction of wave motion, perpendicular to the wave front, is called a ray, as
shown in Fig.11–35. Wave fronts far from the source have lost almost all their curva-
ture (Fig. 11–35b) and are nearly straight, as ocean waves often are. They are then
called plane waves.

For reflection of a two or three dimensional plane wave, as shown in Fig.11–36,
the angle that the incoming or incident wave makes with the reflecting surface is
equal to the angle made by the reflected wave. This is the law of reflection:
the angle of reflection equals the angle of inci
