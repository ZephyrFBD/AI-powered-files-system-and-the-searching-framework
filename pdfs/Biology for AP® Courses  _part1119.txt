on DNA structure and function.) Following the G2 stage of interphase, the cell begins mitosis, the process of active
division by which duplicated chromosomes (chromatids) attach to spindle fibers, align themselves along the equator of the
cell, and then separate from each other.
Following mitosis, the cell undergoes cytokinesis, the splitting of the parent cell into two daughter cells, complete with a
full complement of genetic material. In animal cells, daughter cells are separated by an actin ring, whereas plant cells are
separated by the cell plate, which will grow into a new cell wall. Sometimes cells enter a Gap zero (G0) phase, during which
they do not actively prepare to divide; the G0 phase can be temporary until triggered by an external signal to enter G1, or
permanent, such as mature cardiac muscle cells and nerve cells.
