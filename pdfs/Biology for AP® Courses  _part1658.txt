tic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template
is more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins
called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA–histone
complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight
histones like thread around a spool.
For polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it
encounters a nucleosome. This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands for “facilitates
chromatin transcription.” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once
the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.
The termination of transcription is different for the differ
