he protein from the DNA to activate the
transcription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending
protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator
proteins (Figure 16.10).
Figure 16.10 An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA
sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins
and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements,
enabling differential gene expression.
In addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene
transcription. These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general transcription
factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are rec
