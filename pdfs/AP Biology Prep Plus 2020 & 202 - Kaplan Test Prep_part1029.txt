 decreases the number of carbonate ions available for shell production and
would result in a shiȇ toward more thin-shelled crabs.

The key to this question is in the last sentence before the question. Any organism that is a
unicellular heterotrophic eukaryote without a cell wall must be a protist. (C) is thus
correct. Bacteria, (A), and viruses, (B), lack a nucleus and cellular organelles, and fungi,
(D), have cell walls containing chitin.
7. A
If the mother is a carrier for an autosomal recessive disorder, then her genotype would be
represented with one dominant allele and one recessive allele (Aa). The father is
genotypically normal (AA), so 50% of the children will be carriers (Aa) and 50% will be

(A).
8. C
A cell placed in a hypotonic environment will swell unless action is taken to reduce the
concentration gradient. The sodium potassium pump can be used to maintain cell
volume. During each cyc
