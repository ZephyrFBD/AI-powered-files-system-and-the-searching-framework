 enhancer 
(B) Pituitary enhancer 
(C) Jaw enhancer 
(D) Promoter 
21. 
 In sticklebacks, which of the following is most 
likely to occur if the jaw enhancer is disabled 
instead of the hindlimb enhancer? 
(A) The jaw and a pronounced pelvic spine 
develop normally because the Pitx1 gene is 
expressed in both developing tissues. 
(B) Neither the jaw nor a pronounced pelvic 
spine develop normally because there is no 
Pitx1 gene expression in either developing 
tissue. 
(C) The jaw develops normally, but a pronounced 
pelvic spine does not develop because the 
Pitx1 gene is expressed in the developing 
 
jaw but not in the developing pelvis. 
(D) The jaw does not develop normally, but a 
 
pronounced pelvic spine does develop 
because the Pitx1 gene is expressed 
in the developing pelvis but not in the 
developing jaw. 
22. 
 Which of the following describes a possible 
selective mechanism to explain why freshwater 
sticklebacks typically have reduced pelvic spines? 
(A) Reduced pelvic
