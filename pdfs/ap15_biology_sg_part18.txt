ters are released from the olfactory neuron and bind to receptors in the 
postsynaptic neuron. 
 
(b) Explain how the expression of a limited number of odorant receptor genes can lead to the 
perception of thousands of odors. Use the evidence about the number of odorant receptor genes 
to support your explanation.

Molecular 
• 
One odorant molecule can be 
recognized by more than one odorant 
receptor 
• 
One odorant receptor can bind to more 
than one odorant molecule 
Mathematical combinations expand 
possible odors detected 
CNS Control 
Signals integrated in the brain 
Multiple interactions among neurons in 
the brain  
Genetic 
Alternate processing/splicing (of pre-
mRNA/primary transcript) 
Multiple receptors can be produced from a 
gene
