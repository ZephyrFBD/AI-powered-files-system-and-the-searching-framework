me structure but different functions. The forelegs of an
insect and the forelimbs of a dog are not structurally similar. (One is an invertebrate, and the other a
vertebrate.) They do not share a common ancestor. However, both structures are used for movement. All
of the other examples are vertebrates that are structurally similar.

B
Speciation occurred in the Galapagos finches as a result of the different environments on the islands. This
is an example of divergent evolution. The finches were geographically isolated. Choice (A), convergent
evolution, is the evolution of similar structures in distantly related organisms. Choice (C), disruptive
selection, is selection that favors both extremes at the expense of the intermediates in a population.
Choice (D), stabilizing selection, is selection that favors the intermediates at the expense of the extreme
phenotypes in a population.

D
Mutations produce genetic variability. All of the other answer choices are forms of asexual reproduc
