at 750 torr; (c) the pressure, in atmospheres, if 0.00245 mol 
occupies 413 mL at 138 °C; (d) the quantity of gas, in moles,

 10.35  The Goodyear blimps, which frequently fly over sporting 
events, hold approximately 175,000 ft3 of helium. If the gas 
is at 23 °C and 1.0 atm, what mass of helium is in a blimp?
 10.36  A neon sign is made of glass tubing whose inside diameter is 
2.5 cm and whose length is 5.5 m. If the sign contains neon 
at a pressure of 1.78 torr at 35 °C, how many grams of neon 
are in the sign? (The volume of a cylinder is pr2h.)
 10.37 (a) Calculate the number of molecules in a deep breath of 
air whose volume is 2.25 L at body temperature, 37 °C, and 
a pressure of 735 torr. (b) The adult blue whale has a lung ca-
pacity of 5.0 * 103 L. Calculate the mass of air (assume an 
average molar mass of 28.98 g>mol) contained in an adult
