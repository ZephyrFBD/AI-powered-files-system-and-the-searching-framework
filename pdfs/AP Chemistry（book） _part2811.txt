agram represents a buffer composed of 
equal concentrations of a weak acid, HA, and its conju-
gate base, A-. The heights of the columns are proportional 
to the concentrations of the components of the buffer.  
(a) Which of the three drawings, (1), (2), or (3), represents 
the buffer after the addition of a strong acid? (b) Which of 
the three represents the buffer after the addition of a strong 
base? (c) Which of the three represents a situation that 
cannot arise from the addition of either an acid or a base?

17.2  The beaker on the right contains 0.1 M acetic acid solution 
with methyl orange as an indicator. The beaker on the left 
contains a mixture of 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium 
acetate with methyl orange. (a) Using Figures 16.8 and 
16.9, which solution has a higher pH? (b) Which solution 
is better able to maintain its pH when small amounts of 
NaOH are added? Explain. [Sections 17.1 and 17.2]
