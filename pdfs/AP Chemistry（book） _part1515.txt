? (b) If you combine two atomic orbitals on 
one atom to make a new orbital, is this a hybrid orbital or a 
molecular orbital? (c) Does the Pauli exclusion principle 
(Section 6.7) apply to MOs? Explain.
 9.71 Consider the H2
+ ion. (a) Sketch the molecular orbitals of 
the ion and draw its energy-level diagram. (b) How many 
electrons are there in the H2
+ ion? (c) Write the electron 
configuration of the ion in terms of its MOs. (d) What is 
the bond order in H2
+? (e) Suppose that the ion is excited 
by light so that an electron moves from a lower-energy to 
a higher-energy MO. Would you expect the excited-state 
H2
+  ion to be stable or to fall apart? (f) Which of the follow-
ing statements about part (e) is correct: (i) The light excites 
an electron from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital, 
 
(ii) The light excites an electron from an antibonding orbital 
to a bonding orbital, or (iii) In the excited state there are more 
bonding electrons than antibonding electrons?
