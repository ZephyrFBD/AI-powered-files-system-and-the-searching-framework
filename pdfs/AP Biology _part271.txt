ese organelles is small, circular, and carries
only a small number of genes. Extranuclear genes have been linked to
several rare and severe inherited diseases in humans. Since the products of
most mitochondrial genes are involved with energy production, defects
(mutations) in these genes cause weakness and deterioration in muscles.

Mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother because the fatherâ€™s
mitochondria do not enter the egg during fertilization.
GENES AND THE ENVIRONMENT
The environment can alter the expression of genes. In fruit flies, the
expression of the mutation for vestigial wings (short, shriveled wings) can
be altered by the temperature of the environment. When raised in a hot
environment, fruit flies that are homozygous recessive for vestigial wings
can grow wings almost as long as normal wild-type wings. Many human
diseases have a multifactorial basis. There is an underlying genetic
component with a significant environ
