ional potential energy at points 2 and 3 relative to 
point 1? That is, take  
at point 1. (b) What is the change in potential 
energy when the car goes from point 2 to point 3? (c) Repeat parts (a) and (b),
but take the reference point  
to be at point 3.
APPROACH We are interested in the potential energy of the carâ€“Earth system.
We take upward as the positive y direction, and use the definition of gravitational
potential energy to calculate the potential energy.
SOLUTION (a) We measure heights from point 1
which means initially
that the gravitational potential energy is zero. At point 2, where  
At point 3,
since point 3 is below point 1. Therefore,
(b) In going from point 2 to point 3, the potential energy change 
is
The gravitational potential energy decreases by 
(c) Now we set  
Then  
at point 1, so the potential energy initially
is
At point 2,
so the potential energy is
At point 3,
so the potential energy is zero. The change in potential energy
going from point 2 to point 3 is
