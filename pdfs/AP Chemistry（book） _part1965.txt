metals 
can be accounted for in a qualitative way by the electron-sea model, in 
which the electrons are visualized as being free to move throughout 
the metal. In the molecular orbital model the valence atomic orbit-
als of the metal atoms interact to form energy bands that are incom-
pletely filled by valence electrons. Consequently, the electronic 
structure of a bulk solid is referred to as a band structure. The orbitals 
that constitute the energy band are delocalized over the atoms of the 
metal, and their energies are closely spaced. In a metal the valence 
shell s, p, and d orbitals form bands, and these bands overlap, result-
ing in one or more partially filled bands. Because the energy differ-
ences between orbitals within a band are extremely small, promoting 
electrons to higher-energy orbitals requires very little energy. This 
gives rise to high electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as other 
characteristic metallic properties.
