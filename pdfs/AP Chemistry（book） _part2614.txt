acidity increases as the oxidation number of the central atom increases.
Carboxylic Acids
Another large group of acids is illustrated by acetic acid, a weak acid 1Ka = 1.8 * 10-52:

The portion of the structure shown in red is called the carboxyl group, which is often writ-
ten COOH. Thus, the chemical formula of acetic acid is written as CH3COOH, where 
only the hydrogen atom in the carboxyl group can be ionized. Acids that contain a car-
boxyl group are called carboxylic acids, and they form the largest category of organic 
acids. Formic acid and benzoic acid are further examples of this large and important cat-
egory of acids:

Benzoic acid
Two factors contribute to the acidic behavior of carboxylic acids. First, the additional 
oxygen atom attached to the carbon of the carboxyl group draws electron density from 
the O Â¬H bond, increasing its polarity and helping to stabilize the conjugate base. Sec-
ond, the conjugate base of a carboxy
