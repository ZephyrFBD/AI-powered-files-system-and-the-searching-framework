 growing chain,
after which chain termination occurs. Gel
electrophoresis is performed and the length of
each base is detected by laser scanners with
wavelengths specific to the four different
dNTPS’s.

63. Describe how the model of DNA replication illustrates
the function of topoisomerase.
a.
Topoisomerase relieves the pressure that results
from supercoiling by breaking and reforming
DNA’s phosphate backbone ahead of the
replication fork.
b.
Topoisomerase increases the pressure to increase
supercoiling by breaking and reforming DNA’s
phosphate backbone ahead of the replication
fork.
c.
Topoisomerase relieves the pressure that results
from supercoiling by breaking and reforming
DNA’s nucleotide base pairs ahead of the
replication fork.
d.
Topoisomerase relieves the pressure that results
from separation of DNA strands by breaking and
reforming DNA’s phosphate backbone ahead of
the repli
