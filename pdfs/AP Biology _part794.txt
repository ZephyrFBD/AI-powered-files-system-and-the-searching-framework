Which of the following statements explains the significance of the
fact that a grafted piece of tissue caused a new animal to form that
contained cells of both embryos?
Some cells can direct the fate of other cells, regardless of the
genetic makeup of the cells.
The development of embryonic cells is solely directed by
genes.
Some embryos contain dominant genes, while others contain
recessive genes.
Mutation directs much of embryonic development.
Hans Spemann also completed another set of experiments. Using
microdissection tools, he bisected identical embryos very early in
their development when a crescent of darkly pigmented cells
became visible. The following diagram shows the two different
ways he bisected two embryos and the results of the two surgeries.
