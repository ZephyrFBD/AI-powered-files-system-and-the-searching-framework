•  What other way could you determine how fast the rate of mitosis is occurring in root 
tips?

■ DESIGNING AND CONDUCTING YOUR INVESTIGATION 
Now that you have worked with the root tip model system, design and conduct 
an investigation to determine what biotic or abiotic factors or substances in the 
environment might increase or decrease the rate of mitosis in roots. For instance, what 
factors in the soil might affect the rate of root growth and development? Consider, 
for example, abiotic soil factors such as salinity and pH or biotic factors, including 
roundworms, that might alter root growth.  
■ Part 3: Loss of Cell Cycle Control in Cancer 
Many of us have family members who have or have had cancer. Cancer can occur when 
cells lose control of their cell cycle and divide abnormally. This happens when tumor-
suppressor genes, such as p53 or Rb (retinoblastoma), a
