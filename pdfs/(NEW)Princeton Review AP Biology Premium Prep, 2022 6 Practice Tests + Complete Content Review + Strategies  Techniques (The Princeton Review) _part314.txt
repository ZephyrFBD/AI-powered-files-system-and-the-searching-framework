ent from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis produces only one ovum, not four. The other three
cells, called polar bodies, get only a tiny amount of cytoplasm and eventually degenerate. Why does oogenesis
produce only one ovum? Because the female wants to conserve as much cytoplasm as possible for the surviving
gamete, the ovum.
Here’s a summary of the major differences between mitosis and meiosis.
MITOSIS
MEIOSIS
Occurs in somatic (body) cells
Produces identical cells
Diploid cell → diploid cells
1 cell becomes 2 cells
Number of divisions: 1
Occurs in germ (sex) cells
Produces gametes
Diploid cell → haploid cells
1 cell becomes 4 cells
Number of divisions: 2
Meiotic Errors
Sometimes, a set of chromosomes has an extra or a missing chromosome. This occurs because of nondisjunction
—chromosomes failed to separate properly during meiosis. This error, which produces the wrong number of
chromosomes in a cell, usually results in miscarriage or significant genetic defects. For example, humans typicall
