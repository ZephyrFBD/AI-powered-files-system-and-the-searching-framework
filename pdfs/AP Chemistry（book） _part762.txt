e this point by giving one more example of an enthalpy 
diagram and Hess’s law. Again we use combustion of methane to form 
CO2 and H2O, our reaction from Figure 5.21. This time we envision a dif-
ferent two-step path, with the initial formation of CO, which is then com-
busted to CO2 (Figure 5.22). Even though the two-step path is different 
from that in Figure 5.21, the overall reaction again has ∆H1 = -890 kJ. 
Because H is a state function, both paths must produce the same value 
of ∆H. In Figure 5.22, that means ∆H1 = ∆H2 + ∆H3. We will soon see 
that breaking up reactions in this way allows us to derive the enthalpy 
changes for reactions that are hard to carry out in the laboratory.
5.7 ∣ Enthalpies of Formation
We can use the methods just discussed to calculate enthalpy changes for 
a great many reactions from tabulated ∆H values. For example, exten-
sive tables exist of enthalpies of vaporization (∆H for converting liquids to 
gases), enthalpies of fusion (∆H for melting solid
