d in 1.00 h by the electrolysis of molten AlCl3 if the electrical current is 
10.0 A.
Analyze We are told that AlCl3 is electrolyzed to form Al and asked 
to calculate the number of grams of Al produced in 1.00 h with 
10.0 A.
Plan Figure 20.30 provides a roadmap for this problem. Using the 
current, time, a balanced half-reaction, and the atomic weight of 
aluminum we can calculate the mass of Al produced.
SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 20.14 
Relating Electrical Charge and Quantity of Electrolysis
Solve 
First, we calculate the coulombs of electrical 
charge passed into the electrolytic cell (note 
that 10.0 A = 10.0 C/s):
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How much time is needed to deposit 1.0 g of chromium 
metal from an aqueous solution of CrCl3 using a current  
of 1.5 A? 
(a) 3.8 * 10-2 s (b) 21 min (c) 62 min (d) 139 min  
(e) 3.2 * 103 min
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) The half-reaction for formation of magnesium metal 
upon electrolysis of molten MgCl2 is Mg2+ + 2 e- ¡ Mg.
