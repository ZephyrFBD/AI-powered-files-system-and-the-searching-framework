tly transparent sample transmits
100% of the light. Absorbance is the opposite. It is a measurement of the
light that is absorbed by the sample. In either case, the detector senses the
light that is being transmitted through the sample and converts this
information into a digital display. Be careful that, when looking at data
from a spectrophotometer, you notice whether the data is for transmittance
or for absorbance.
Table 19.3 represents sample data from a spectrophotometer. The
higher the reading, the more light that is being absorbed by the sample and
the darker brown the sample will be.

Below is a graph of the data from the spectrophotometer:

Initially, the enzyme activity increases slowly and reaches a maximum
rate at approximately 42°C. Beyond that, the enzyme (protein) denatures as
the heat continues to rise, until the enzyme does not function at all (at
100°C).
