 to 
fruit flies: 
Day 1 
1. During this discussion, you can assess if your students know what fruit flies are and 
when and where they have seen them. The class should make a list of when and 
where they notice fruit flies. They should generate a list that may include a bowl of 
fruit, a picnic dinner, and someoneâ€™s glass of wine. Students should also view pictures 
of fruit flies to recall previous experiments with these model research organisms 
used in genetics or population studies. 
2. Have the students make observations about fruit fly behavior by conducting the 
following very simple geotactic experiment. Students can work in small groups. 
a.  Using fruit fly cultures, toss at least 10 flies into an empty vial. Do not 
anesthetize the flies before this or any of the behavior experiments. 
b.  Observe the position of the flies in an upright vial sitting in a test tube rack on 
the lab table. Do not touch the vial while making observations. 
c.  Invert the vial and observe the p
