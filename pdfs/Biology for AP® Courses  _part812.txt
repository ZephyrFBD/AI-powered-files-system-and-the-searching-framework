lycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. The conversion
is a three-step process (Figure 7.9).
Step 1. A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium.
The result of this step is a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase). This is the first
of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed. This step proceeds twice (remember: there are two
pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis) for every molecule of glucose metabolized; thus, two of the six carbons
will have been removed at the end of both steps.

Step 2. The hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group, and the electrons are picked up by NAD+, forming NADH.
The high-energy electrons from NADH will be used later to generate ATP.
Step 3. The enzyme-bound acetyl gr
