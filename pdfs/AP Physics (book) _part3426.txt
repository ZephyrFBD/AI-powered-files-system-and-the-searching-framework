0,000 years ago, what is the activity today?
76. Using Section 30–2 and Appendix B, determine the energy
required to remove one neutron from 
How many times
greater is this energy than the binding energy of the last
neutron in 
77. (a) If all of the atoms of the Earth were to collapse and
simply become nuclei, what would be the Earth’s new
radius? (b) If all of the atoms of the Sun were to collapse
and simply become nuclei, what would be the Sun’s new
radius?
78. (a) A 72-gram sample of natural carbon contains the usual
fraction of 
Estimate roughly how long it will take
before there is only one 
nucleus left. (b) How does the
answer in (a) change if the sample is 340 grams? What
does this tell you about the limits of carbon dating?
79. If the mass of the proton were just a little closer to the
mass of the neutron, the following reaction would be pos-
sible even at low collision energies:
(a) Why would this situation be catastrophic? (See last
paragraph of Chapter 33.) (b) By what perc
