 occur during RNA processing,
which may involve the speed or types of splicing that occur to remove introns and join exons
together to produce the mature mRNA.
iv. Before translation, the amount of mRNA sent to the ribosome can be controlled by how efficiently
it is transported from the nucleus to the ribosome, or by how many mRNA transcripts are
degraded along the way.
v. After translation, opportunities for further regulation of gene expression may involve protein
modifications and transport, such as clipping off small parts of the protein, adding sugars to the
protein, or reading signals located in the proteinâ€™s amino acid sequence that determine where the
protein is to be transported.
Gene regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes accounts for some of the phenotypic
diversity of organisms, even though they may have similar genes.
