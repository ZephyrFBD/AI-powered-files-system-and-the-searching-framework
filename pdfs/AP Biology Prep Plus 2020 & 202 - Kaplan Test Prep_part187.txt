 increasing the amount of cholesterol would make integral
proteins more secure in the membrane by forming “raȇs” around
them. Thus, (A) must be the correct answer. In fact, oxidative stress
essentially “punches holes” in the plasma membrane, allowing ions to
flow in and out without regulation. This aﬀects the membrane
potential of the cell and could prevent the cell from responding to or
conducting an action potential. As a result, aﬀected cells are more
likely to atrophy and die, decreasing the quantity of acetylcholine-
producing cells.

Energy must be used to move molecules up their concentration
gradient, as shown in process C. Therefore, (C) is correct. Processes A
and B show molecules moving down their concentration gradients.
Thus, no input of energy is required, and (A) and (B) are both incorrect.
Since process C does require the input of energy to move molecules up
their concentration gradient, (D) is incorrect.
