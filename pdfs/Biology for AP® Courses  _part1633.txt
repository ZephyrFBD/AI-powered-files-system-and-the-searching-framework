The prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-
bound nuclei and other organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic
chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is
called the nucleoid. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that
may only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell
division and often carry traits such as antibiotic res
