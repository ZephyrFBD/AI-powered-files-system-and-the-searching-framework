(catalyzed by
enzymes that operate within an optimal temperature range) and helps transport
compounds in and out of cells. Due to its high specific heat capacity (heat required to
raise 1 kg of water by 1°C), water is able to absorb a large amount of energy without
significantly changing its temperature, so it serves as a buﬀer against sudden
temperature changes. Thus, the correct answer is (B). (A) is incorrect because the most
common essential elements found in living organisms are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen; hydrogen and oxygen are no more important than the others. (C) is incorrect
because water acts a solvent, not a solute, for chemical reactions. (D) is incorrect
because most organisms are not able to thrive at temperatures so high that they come
close to the boiling point of water.
