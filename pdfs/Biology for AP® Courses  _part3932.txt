 a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines
that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes
and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs. The activation of B cells corresponding
to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection. This phenomenon
drastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance
toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen.

Figure 33.13 B cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells and bind a variety of antigens through their
variable regions. The signal transduction region transfers the signal into the cell.
T and B cells differ in one fundamental way: whereas T cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in MHC
molecules by APCs, B cells function as APCs that bind
