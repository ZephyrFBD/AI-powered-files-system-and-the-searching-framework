Figure 1. Pedigree tree of family members with an X-linked disease
Hemophilia is an X-linked disease associated with the inability to produce specific proteins in the blood-clotting
pathway. In Figure 1, the family members afflicted with the disease are shown with filled-in squares (male) or
circles (females). A couple is trying to determine the likelihood of passing on the disease to their future children
