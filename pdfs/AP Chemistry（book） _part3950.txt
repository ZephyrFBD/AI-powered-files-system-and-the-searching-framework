The pH is obtained 
by changing the sign of the value obtained. (Be sure to change 
the sign after taking the logarithm.)
 3H+4 = 0.015
 log[H+] = -1.82 12 significant figures2
 pH = -1-1.822 = 1.82
(2)  
To obtain the hydrogen ion concentration when given the pH, 
we must take the antilog of -pH.
 pH = -log3H+4 = 3.80
 log3H+4 = -3.80
 3H+4 = antilog1-3.802 = 10-3.80 = 1.6 * 10-4 M

A.3 | Quadratic Equations
An algebraic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation. The two 
solutions to such an equation are given by the quadratic formula:
x = -b { 2b2 - 4ac

Many calculators today can calculate the solutions to a quadratic equation with one or 
two keystrokes. Most of the time, x corresponds to the concentration of a chemical spe-
cies in solution. Only one of the solutions will be a positive number, and tha
