very high energy and are steered so that they collide head-on. One way to
accomplish such colliding beams with a single accelerator is through the use of
storage rings, in which oppositely circulating beams can be repeatedly brought
into collision with one another at particular points. For example, in the
experiments that provided strong evidence for the top quark (Section 32–9 and
Fig. 32–15), the Fermilab Tevatron accelerated protons and antiprotons each to
900 GeV, so that the combined energy of head-on collisions was 1.8 TeV.
The largest collider is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, with a
circumference of 26.7 km (Fig.32–5). The two colliding beams are designed to each
carry 7-TeV protons for a total interaction energy of 14 TeV. For the experiments
in 2011 and 2012 the total interaction energy was 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The protons 
for each of the beams, moving in opposite directions, are accelerated in several
stages. The penultimate is SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron), seen in
