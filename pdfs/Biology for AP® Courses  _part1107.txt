ir of tissues. Cell division is tightly regulated,
and the occasional failure of regulation can have life-threatening consequences. Single-celled organisms use cell division as
their method of reproduction.
Not all cells in the body reproduce to repair tissues. Most nerve tissues, for example, are not capable of regeneration. This
means people who have damaged their nerves or nervous system are often left paralyzed.
However, this may change in the future; scientists have discovered a new drug called intracellular signal peptide (ISP),
which helps nerve cells regenerate in rats. It works by blocking an enzyme that causes scar tissue in damaged nerve cells
allowing the nervous system a chance to repair itself. The full research study is located here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
