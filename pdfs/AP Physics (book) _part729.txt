 which a moving object (called
the “projectile”) strikes a second object initially at rest (the “target”). This is the
common situation in games such as billiards and pool, and for experiments in
atomic and nuclear physics (the projectiles, from radioactive decay or a high-
energy accelerator, strike a stationary target nucleus, Fig. 7–17).
Figure 7–18 shows the incoming projectile,
heading along the x axis
toward the target object,
which is initially at rest. If these are billiard balls,
strikes 
not quite head-on and they go off at the angles 
and 
respectively, which are measured relative to 
’s initial direction (the x axis).†
