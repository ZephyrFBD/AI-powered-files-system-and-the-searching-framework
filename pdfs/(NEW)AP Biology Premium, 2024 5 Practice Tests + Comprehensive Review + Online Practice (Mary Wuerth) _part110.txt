otic ribosomes differ slightly from the subunits of eukaryotic ribosomes, you do NOT
need to memorize the specific differences.
During translation, ribosomes assemble amino acids into polypeptide chains according to the mRNA sequence.
Free ribosomes are found in the cytosol in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, bound ribosomes are
found on the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
The endoplasmic reticulum is a series of membrane channels in eukaryotic cells, as shown in Figure 5.3. Rough
endoplasmic reticulum has ribosomes bound to its membranes and functions in protein synthesis. Smooth
endoplasmic reticulum does not contain ribosomes and functions in the synthesis of lipids and the detoxification of
harmful substances in the cell.

The Golgi complex (also known as the Golgi body) is a stack of flattened membrane sacs (called cisternae), as
shown in Figure 5.4. The interior of each cisterna is called the lumen and contains the enzym
