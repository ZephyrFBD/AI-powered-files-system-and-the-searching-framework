compartments, and the
injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. For this reason,
vaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol,
oral, or transcutaneous (absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. Importantly, mucosal-administered
vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as
injected vaccines.

Currently, a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available, and the polio and typhoid vaccines can
be administered orally, as shown in Figure 33.19. Similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being
adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices. Eventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to
