 them to near extinction, were a genetically diverse
population. Today, the genetic diversity is extremely low because all
existing California condors are descended from just a handful of
individuals. Likewise, black-footed ferrets, whose population once
dropped to alarmingly low levels, have been bred from only a few
individuals, making them especially vulnerable to threats. Tasmanian
devils (alike on the brink of extinction due to low genetic diversity) are
being bred on an island with disease-free animals to protect them from a
contagious cancer. Due to habitat loss, prairie chickens live in small
groups isolated from one another. The isolation of prairie chicken
populations has in turn contributed to a loss in their genetic variance. On
a related note, the Irish potato blight and southern corn rust (diseases
caused by fungi) were the consequence of low genetic diversity.
Mass extinctions involve deadly events such as volcanic eruptions,
asteroid collisions, or global warming/coolin
