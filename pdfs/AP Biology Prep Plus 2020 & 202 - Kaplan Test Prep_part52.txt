quence is written and read from the
amino end (N-terminus) to the carboxyl end (C-terminus). The properties
and order of the amino acids determine the structure and function of the
polypeptide. For instance, proteins with more basic amino acids will have
an overall positive charge in a neutral solution, while proteins with more
acidic amino acids will have an overall negative charge.
The sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is the protein’s
primary structure and is determined by the DNA of the gene that encodes
the protein. The protein’s secondary structure refers to local folds along
the chain due to interactions between the atoms of the backbone. The
most common types of secondary structures are the α helix and the β
pleated sheet, which involve hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl O of
one amino acid and the amino H of another. A protein’s shape and
stability are influenced by the interactions between a protein and its
immediate environment. For example, a protein in an aqu
