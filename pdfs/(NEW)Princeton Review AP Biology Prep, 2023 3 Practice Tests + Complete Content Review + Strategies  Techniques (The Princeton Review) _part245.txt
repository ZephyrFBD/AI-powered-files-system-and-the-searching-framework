he Krebs cycle
2 FADH2 from the Krebs cycle
That gives us a total of 12 electron or energy carriers altogether.
These electron carriers—NADH and FADH2—“shuttle” electrons to the electron transport chain, the resulting
NAD+ and FADH can be recycled to be used as carriers again, and the hydrogen atoms are split into hydrogen ions
and electrons.
H2 → 2H+ + 2e–
Electron transport chain reactions occur in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and
prokaryotic plasma membranes. The electron transport chain here is similar to
that seen in photosynthesis. They differ in their final electron acceptors:
NADP+ and O2.
Then, two interesting things occur. First, the high-energy electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed down a
series of protein carrier molecules that are embedded in the cristae; thus, it is called the electron transport chain.
Some of the carrier molecules in the electron transport chain are NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome C.
Oxygen is required as the final stop in the electron transport chai
