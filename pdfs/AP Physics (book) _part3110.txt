n light: electrons are accelerated
through a potential difference of 12 V, pass through two
closely spaced slits separated by a distance d, and create 
an interference pattern. (a) Using Example 27–11 and
Section 24–3 as guides, find the required value for d if the
first-order interference fringe is to be produced at an angle
of 10°. (b) Given the approximate size of atoms, would it
be possible to construct the required two-slit set-up for 
this experiment?
4. Does each of the following support the wave nature or the
particle nature of light? (a) The existence of the cutoff
frequency in the photoelectric effect; (b) Young’s double-
slit experiment; (c) the shift in the photon frequency in
Compton scattering; (d) the diffraction of light.

5. (a) From Sections 22–3, 24–4, and 27–3, estimate the mini-
mum energy (eV) that initiates the chemical process on the
retina responsible for vision. (b) Estimate the threshold
photon energy above which the eye registers no sensation
of sight.
