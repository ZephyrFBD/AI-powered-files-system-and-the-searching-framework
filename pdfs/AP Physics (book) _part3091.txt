may have an energy of 320 keV. What is
its wavelength? Would we expect significant diffraction of
this type of light when it passes through an everyday
opening, such as a door?
13. (I) Calculate the momentum of a photon of yellow light of
wavelength
14. (I) What is the momentum of a 
X-ray photon?
15. (I) For the photoelectric effect, make a table that shows
expected observations for a particle theory of light and for
a wave theory of light. Circle the actual observed effects.
(See Section 27–3.)
16. (II) About 0.1 eV is required to break a “hydrogen bond” in
a protein molecule. Calculate the minimum frequency and
maximum wavelength of a photon that can accomplish this.
17. (II) What minimum frequency of light is needed to eject 
electrons from a metal whose work function is 4.8 * 10–19 J?
l = 0.014 nm
5.80 * 10–7 m.
8.1 * 1013 Hz.
2.8 * 10–15 kg
2.60 * 10–3 T,
1.88 * 104 Vm
640-Vm

18. (II) The human eye can respond to as little as 
of light
energy. For a wavelength at the peak o
