Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers. If you set up a pyramid of numbers, youâ€™ll see that the
herrings belong to the third trophic level.

The biomass is the total bulk of a particular living organism. The phytoplankton population has both the
largest biomass and the most energy.

C
A decrease in the herring population will lead to an increase in the number of crustaceans and a decrease
in the phytoplankton population. Reorder the organisms according to their trophic levels and determine
which populations will increase and decrease accordingly.

Relatedness is shown on a phylogenetic tree by how far back you have to go to reach the common
ancestor of the two species (shown by a branch node). Since the recent species are on the right, traveling
to the left goes back in time. Because you have to go to the oldest common ancestor to connect B.
musculus and B. brydei, they are the least closely related. Even though they are near each other on the
tree, clad
