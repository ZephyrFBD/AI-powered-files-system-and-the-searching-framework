 f-1(b) = a. Thus the point (a, b) is on the graph of f if and only if the point (b, 
a) is on the graph of f-1. 
We get the point (b, a) from the point (a, b) by reflecting in the line y = x .

2.5.4 Application of Inverse of a Function 
 
83 
When working with functions that model real-world situations, we name the variables using 
letters that suggest the quantity being modeled. For instance we may use t for time, d for 
distance, V for volume, and so on. 
 
Example 5 
At a local pizza parlor the daily special is $12 for a plain cheese pizza plus $2 for each 
additional topping. 
(a) Find a function f that models the price of a pizza with n toppings. 
(b) Find the inverse of the function f. What does f-1 represent? 
(c) If a pizza costs $22, how many toppings does it have?
