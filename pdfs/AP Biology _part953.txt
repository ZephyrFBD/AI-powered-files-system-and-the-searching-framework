of two different substances: 1 glycerol plus 3 fatty acids. Choice B is
not correct because lipids do not dissolve in water. Choice C is not
correct because the exoskeletons of insects are made of chitin (a

(B) First, orient yourself in the drawing. The process at the top of
the illustration is replication; the bottom is transcription. So if 1 is
thymine, then its complement, I, is adenine. Therefore, if I is
adenine, then its base pair is thymine.
(D) The bottom of the diagram represents transcription. Therefore, if
4 is adenine, then D is its complement in RNA, which is uracil.
(B) Anaerobic respiration is much less efficient at making ATP than
