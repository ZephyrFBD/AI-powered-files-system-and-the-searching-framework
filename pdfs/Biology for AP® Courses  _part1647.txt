 they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are
essential to the process of translation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs except for the 5S rRNA molecule.
The “S” designation applies to “Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle
sediments during centrifugation.

RNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-
mRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module’s discussion of
