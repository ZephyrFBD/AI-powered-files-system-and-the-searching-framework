of urms to ump for a sample of  O21g2 at 300 K? Will this ratio 
change as the temperature changes? Will it be different for a different gas?
The dependence of molecular speed on mass has two interesting consequences. The 
first is effusion, which is the escape of gas molecules through a tiny hole (Figure 10.14). 
The second is diffusion, which is the spread of one substance throughout a space 
or throughout a second substance. For example, the molecules of a perfume diffuse 
throughout a room.
Graham’s Law of Effusion
In 1846, Thomas Graham (1805–1869) discovered that the effusion rate of a gas is 
inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. Assume we have two gases at 
Sample Exercise 10.13 
Calculating a Root-Mean-Square Speed
Calculate the rms speed of the molecules in a sample of N2 gas at 25 °C.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the identity of a gas and the temperature, the 
two quantities we need to calculate the rms speed.
Plan We calculate the rms speed using Equ
