reatest numbers of bacteria
congregated. Therefore, less oxygen was present in that area and less photosynthesis occurred under green light,
so choice (C) is incorrect.
17. (B) Green light has wavelengths between 495–570 nm based on the table. Choices (A), (C), and (D) are
incorrect because violet, orange, and red light have wavelengths in the ranges of 380–450 nm, 590–620 nm, and
620–750 nm, respectively.
18. (C) The role of photons of light energy in photosynthesis is to excite the electrons in the photosystems. Light
does not activate the genes used in photosynthesis, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because
carbon dioxide is consumed, not produced, during photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is fixed in the light-
independent reactions, not during the Krebs (citric acid) cycle, so choice (D) is incorrect.
19. (B) The temperature of the chambers is the independent variable. The number of germinating mung beans was
kept constant, so it is not an independent variable. Thu
