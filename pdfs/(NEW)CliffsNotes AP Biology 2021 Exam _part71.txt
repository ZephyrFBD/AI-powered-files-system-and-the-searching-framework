a. the structure of an enzyme
b. how enzymes function
c. how enzymes are regulated
Answers and Explanations
Multiple-Choice Questions
1. C. Phospholipids are composed of glycerol molecules bonded to two fatty acids and one phosphate group. The
phosphate group is a hydrophilic “head,” and the long hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids are hydrophobic “tails.” In
cell membranes, phospholipids orient themselves into two layers, with the hydrophobic tails pointing to the inside of
the “sandwich.”
2. C. When product E is no longer consumed by other reactions, it is available to inactivate enzyme D′. As quantities
of product E accumulate, more and more of D′ would be inactivated. As a result, the rate of production of E would
decrease and quantities of product D would accumulate. As product D accumulates, its rate of production decreases.
At the same time, the rate of the reverse reaction, of D to C, increases. Now, mo
