he relationships
among the other branches of the phylogenetic tree.
(A)
This branch represents all of the unknown and unresolved
species on the bird phylogenetic tree.
(B)
This branch indicates the most ancestral group on the tree,
which evolved from non-bird groups such as reptiles.
(C)
This branch represents extinct groups of birds that cannot be

(D)
4. Which of the following provides the best scientific answer to the
question “Which came first, the chicken or the egg”?
Since all of the animals shown on the tree make eggs, the egg
must have evolved aȇer the animals diverged from a common
ancestor.
(A)
The chicken and the egg evolved at the same time because you
cannot have one without the other.
(B)
Since all of the existing species on the tree make eggs, egg
production must be an ancestral trait and must have existed in
the common ancestor. Therefore, the egg came before the
chicken.
(C)
It is impossible to draw a conclusion based on the infor
