e. The
energy for the production of ATP is supplied by the potential energy
of the proton gradient that accumulates in the outer compartment. As
protons flow down this gradient from the outer compartment
through the ATP synthase channel to the matrix, ADP gets
phosphorylated and ATP is produced. If the ATP synthase channel
were to be shut down (by some metabolic poison), protons would
continue to accumulate in the outer compartment. Remember, that as
protons (H+) accumulate, the pH value decreases. The y-axis of the
graph is “pH Difference Across the Membrane.” As the protons
accumulate, the difference in the pH between outside and inside the
membrane increases. If the y-axis had been simply “pH,” the answer
would have been choice D.
