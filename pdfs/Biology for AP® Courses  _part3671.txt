with the environment), as demands for oxygen increased
with terrestrial living, natural selection favored a closed circulatory system in which blood is transported in vessels. To
increase efficiency, within closed systems the heart evolved from two chambers in fish (one atrium and one ventricle) to the
four-chambered heart (two atria and two ventricles) seen in crocodiles, birds, and mammals.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
