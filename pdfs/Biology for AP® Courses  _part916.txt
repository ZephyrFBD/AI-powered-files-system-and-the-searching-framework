er space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every
organism uses to power its metabolism. In brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, whose
energy is then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? The
energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by
photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago.
Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis
(Figure 8.2). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, “self-feeders
using light”). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (“other feeders”),
because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting
group of bact
