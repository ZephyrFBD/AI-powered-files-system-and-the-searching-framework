IST-1
Fertilization increases genetic variation in populations by providing new combinations
of genes. It also restores the diploid number.
Random Fertilization
One human ovum represents one of approximately 8 million possible
chromosome combinations. The same is true for the human sperm. Thus,
when one sperm fertilizes one ovum, 8 million Ã— 8 million recombinations
are possible.
REGULATION AND TIMING OF THE CELL CYCLE
A cell cycle control system regulates the rate at which cells divide.

Several checkpoints act as built-in stop signals that halt the cell unless
they are overridden by go-ahead signals. Checkpoints register signals from
inside and outside the cell. Three checkpoints exist in G1, G2, and M. The
G1 checkpoint is known as the restriction point (R) and is the most
important one in mammals. If it receives a go-ahead, the cell will most
likely complete cell division. On the other hand, if
