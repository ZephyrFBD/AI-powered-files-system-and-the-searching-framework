 so in Earth’s geological history, the only variables that seem to have a
global impact are related to human activity. You should be familiar with
two of these variables.
The Earth is surrounded by a layer of ozone (O3). The layer lies in the
stratosphere, 10–17 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, and protects
the surface from harmful UV rays emitted by the Sun. Over the past few
decades, scientists have determined that the ozone layer is being
depleted by compounds containing chlorine, fluorine, bromine, carbon,
and hydrogen (halocarbons) that seem to be produced by human activity.
One particular group of chemicals, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), has
received a considerable amount of the blame for depletion of the ozone
layer.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The ozone layer may be depleted by as much as 60 percent over
the Antarctic in the spring, causing the notorious hole in the
ozone layer. Scientists worry that without changes in human
