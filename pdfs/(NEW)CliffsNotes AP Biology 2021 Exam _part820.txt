uaiacol) is used, its disappearance or
the accumulation of its product (tetraguaiacol) can be measured.
 
In this investigation of H2O2decomposition, you document the progress of
 
the reaction by measuring the accumulation of tetraguaiacol or the
 
accumulation of O2. Here are three ways to do to that:
1. Color intensity by comparing to a color palette. A color palette can be created in which a series of test tubes
with increasing color intensity are correlated with increasing concentration of tetraguaiacol product. To
prepare the palette, run the H2O2 decomposition reaction with
peroxidase and guaiacol to completion and then make a series of product dilutions (10%, 20%, etc.). You can use
this palette to evaluate the progress of the reaction because each dilution bears the color of the product
(tetraguaiacol) at a concentration proportional to the reactant (guaiacol). Note that four guaiacol molecules are
converted to one tetraguaiacol.
2. Color intensity by measuring absorbance. A s
