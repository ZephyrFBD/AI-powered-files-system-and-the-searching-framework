you need to perform to locate more precisely the position of 
cadmium in the activity series?
 4.58 The following reactions (note that the arrows are pointing 
only one direction) can be used to prepare an activity series 
for the halogens:
Br21aq2 + 2 NaI1aq2 ยก 2 NaBr1aq2 + I21aq2 
Cl21aq2 + 2 NaBr1aq2 ยก 2 NaCl1aq2 + Br21aq2
 
 (a) Which elemental halogen would you predict is the most 
stable, upon mixing with other halides? (b) Predict whether 
a reaction will occur when elemental chlorine and potassium 
iodide are mixed. (c) Predict whether a reaction will occur 
when elemental bromine and lithium chloride are mixed.
Concentrations of Solutions (Section 4.5)
 4.59 (a) Is the concentration of a solution an intensive or an ex-
tensive property? (b) What is the difference between 0.50 
mol HCl and 0.50 M HCl?
 4.60 You make 1.000 L of an aqueous solution that contains 35.0 g 
of sucrose (C12H22O11). (a) What is the molarity of sucrose in 
this solution? (b) How many liters of wat
