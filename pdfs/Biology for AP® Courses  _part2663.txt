ter potential (Ψtotal) is lower outside the cells than inside, water moves out of the cells
and the plant wilts. When (b) the total water potential is higher outside the plant cells than inside, water moves into the
cells, resulting in turgor pressure (Ψp) and keeping the plant erect. (credit: modification of work by Victor M. Vicente

Gravity Potential
Gravity potential (Ψg) is always negative to zero in a plant with no height. It always removes or consumes potential energy
from the system. The force of gravity pulls water downwards to the soil, reducing the total amount of potential energy in
the water in the plant (Ψtotal). The taller the plant, the taller the water column, and the more influential Ψg becomes. On
a cellular scale and in short plants, this effect is negligible and easily ignored. However, over the height of a tall tree like
a giant coastal redwood, the gravitational pull of –0.1 MPa m-1 is equivalent to an extra 1 MPa of resistance that must be
overcome for wa
