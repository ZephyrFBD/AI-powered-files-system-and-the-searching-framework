Water is released, and N¬C bonds are formed between molecules.
Table 12.6 lists nylon 6,6 and some other common polymers obtained by conden-
sation polymerization. Notice that these polymers have backbones containing N or O 
atoms as well as C atoms.

There are over a billion motor vehicles in the world. Improvement 
in the fundamental understanding of the structure and properties 
of materials has enabled the development of motor vehicles that are 
safer, more powerful, more comfortable, and more fuel efficient. Let’s 
take a look at some of these modern materials (Figure 12.38).
Metals and metal alloys are incorporated into many parts of an 
automobile. For example, aluminum is the primary component of 
the radiator, intake manifold, and engine block. Steel is typically 
the material used for the frame and body. Stainless steel is utilized 
in mufflers, exhaust silenc
