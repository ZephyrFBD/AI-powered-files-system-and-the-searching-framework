ible for the 
properties of metals, in terms of two models—
the electron-sea model and the molecular-
orbital model. Learn how overlap of atomic 
orbitals gives rise to bands in metals.
 12.5  ▶ Ionic Solids Examine the structures 
and properties of solids held together by 
the mutual attractions between cations and 
anions. Learn how the structures of ionic 
solids depend on the relative sizes of the 
ions and their stoichiometry.
 12.6  ▶ Molecular Solids Examine solids that 
form when molecules are held together by 
weak intermolecular forces.
 12.7  ▶ Covalent-Network Solids Learn 
about solids in which the atoms are held 
together by extended networks of covalent 
bonds. Learn how the electronic structure 
and properties of semiconductors differ from 
those of metals.
 12.8  ▶ Polymers Learn about polymers—long 
chain-like molecules in which the motif of 
a small molecule is repeated many times 
over. Explore how both molecular shape and 
interactions between polymer chains affect
