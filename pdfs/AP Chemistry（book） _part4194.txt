ffer because HNO3 is a strong acid 
and the NO3
  - ion is merely a spectator ion. page 723 (a) The OH- 
of NaOH (a strong base) reacts with the acid member of the buffer 
1CH3COOH2, abstracting a proton. Thus, 3CH3COOH4 decreases 
and 3CH3COO-4 increases. (b) The H+ of HCl (a strong acid) reacts 
with the base member of the buffer 3CH3COO-4. Thus, 3CH3COO-4 
decreases and 3CH3COOH4 increases. page 726 HClO would be 
more suitable for a pH = 7.0 buffer solution. To make a buffer we 
would also need a salt containing ClO-, such as NaClO. page 732 
The pH = 7. The neutralization of a strong base with a strong acid 
gives a salt solution at the equivalence point. The salt contains ions 
that do not change the pH of water. page 736 The conjugate base 
of the weak acid is the majority species in solution at the equivalence 
point, and this conjugate base reacts with water in a Kb reaction  
to produce OH-. Therefore, the pH at the equivalence point for a 
weak acid/strong base titration is
