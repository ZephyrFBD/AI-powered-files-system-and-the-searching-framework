t answer is (B). (A) is incorrect because although the mRNA
sequence contains 52 codons, the last codon does not encode an
amino acid. (C) and (D) are incorrect because three nucleotides encode
one amino acid. The number of nucleotides is divided by 3, not
multiplied by 3.

Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotides made of a pentose sugar, a
phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. RNA contains the pentose
sugar ribose, whereas DNA contains deoxyribose. Both RNA and DNA
contain the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine, and cytosine, but
diﬀer in that RNA contains uracil and DNA has thymine. Thus, the
correct answer is (D). Typically, DNA is present in double-stranded
form, and RNA is present in single-stranded form. However, some
viruses have a double-stranded RNA genome, so (A) is incorrect. (B) is
incorrect because adenine is present in both DNA and RNA. (C) is
incorrect because phosphate is found in all nucleic acids.
