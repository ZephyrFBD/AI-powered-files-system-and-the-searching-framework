eem to play a role in growth as there is no obvious pattern and all of
the times had similar growth. Both plants prefer pH 7.
30. A
The top growth conditions for Species B are pH 7, 40 mL, and any time of day. In those conditions, the
Species B plants grew the tallest.
31. D
The plants in the watering time experiment seemed to be around 60 and 20 cm in height. This corresponds to a
pH of 7 rather than 4, and a watering volume of 80 mL rather than 40 mL.
32. D
Choices (A), (B), and (C) would all give interesting information about the experiment, but the only one that
would make the results more statistically significant is to increase the number of plants in each group. Two
plants is not enough to be sure about the results of the experiment.
33. D
Photoperiodism is a response of plants to the changing length of day or night. It is a way that plants respond to
a signal from the environment. Animal circadian rhythms are also a response to the environment, making the
correct answer (D). Vi
