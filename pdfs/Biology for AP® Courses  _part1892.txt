In Search box on the left panel, type any gene name or phenotypic characteristic, such as iris pigmentation (eye color).
Select the species you want to study, and then press Enter. The genome map viewer will indicate which chromosome
encodes the gene in your search. Click each hit in the genome viewer for more detailed information. This type of search
is the most basic use of the genome viewer; it can also be used to compare sequences between species, as well as m
