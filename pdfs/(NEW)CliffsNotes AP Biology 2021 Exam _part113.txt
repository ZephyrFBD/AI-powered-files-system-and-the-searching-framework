ic and the solution in the dialysis bag is hypertonic when their solute concentrations are
compared.
18. B. Since sucrose cannot pass through the membrane, no sucrose will enter the tube. However, since there is a
concentration gradient, water will diffuse down the gradient. The beginning concentrations of water in the tube and
in the beaker are 100% and 90%, respectively. Therefore, water will move from the tube and into the beaker. The
water level in the tube will drop (and the beaker level will rise), and the concentration of sucrose in the beaker will
decrease.
