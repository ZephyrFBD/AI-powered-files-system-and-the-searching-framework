 process. The rate 
constant for the decomposition at 660 K is 4.5 * 10-2 s-1. 
(a) If we begin with an initial SO2Cl2 pressure of 450 torr, 
what is the partial pressure of this substance after 60 s? 
(b) At what time will the partial pressure of SO2Cl2 de-
cline to one-tenth its initial value?

N2O5, 2 N2O51g2 ¡ 4 NO21g2 + O21g2,  a t  70 °C  i s 
6.82 * 10-3 s-1. Suppose we start with 0.0250 mol of 
N2O51g2 in a volume of 2.0 L. (a) How many moles of 
N2O5 will remain after 5.0 min? (b) How many minutes 
will it take for the quantity of N2O5 to drop to 0.010 mol? 
(c) What is the half-life of N2O5 at 70 °C ?
