er it is acidic 
or basic. Because Na+ is a cation of group 1A, it has no influence 
on pH. Thus, our analysis of whether the solution is acidic or basic 
must focus on the behavior of the HPO4
2- ion. We need to con-
sider that HPO4
2- can act as either an acid or a base:
As acid  HPO4
2-1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + PO4
3-1aq2 
[16.46]
As base  HPO4
2-1aq2 + H2O ∆
               H2PO4
-1aq2 + OH-1aq2 
[16.47]
Of these two reactions, the one with the larger equilibrium 
constant determines whether the solution is acidic or basic.
Solve The value of Ka for Equation 16.46 is Ka3 for 
H3PO4: 4.2 * 10-13 (Table 16.3). For Equation 16.47, we 
must calculate Kb for the base HPO4
2- from the value of 
Ka for its conjugate acid, H2PO4
-, and the relationship 
Ka * Kb = Kw 1Equation 16.402. The relevant value of Ka for 
H2PO4
- is Ka2 for H3PO4: 6.2 * 10-8 (from Table 16.3). We there-
fore have
 Kb1HPO4
2-2 * Ka1H2PO4
-2 = Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
 Kb1HPO4
2-2 = 1.0 * 10-14
6.2 * 10-8 = 1.6 * 10-7.
This Kb value is
