ts, as illustrated in Sample 
Exercise 15.11. The calculations frequently involve the quadratic formula, as you will 
see in this exercise.
A 1.000-L flask is filled with 1.000 mol of H21g2 and 2.000 mol of I21g2 at 448 °C. The value of the equilibrium constant Kc for 
the reaction
H21g2 + I21g2 ∆ 2 HI1g2
at 448 °C is 50.5. What are the equilibrium concentrations of H2, I2, and HI in moles per liter?
Solve
(1) We note the initial concentrations of 
H2 and I2:
Analyze We are given the volume of a container, an equilibrium 
constant, and starting amounts of reactants in the container and 
are asked to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all species.
Plan In this case, we are not given any of the equilibrium concen-
trations. We must develop some relationships that relate the initial 
concentrations to those at equilibrium. The procedure is similar in 
many regards to that outlined in Sample Exercise 15.8, where we 
calculated an equilibrium constant using initial concentrations.
