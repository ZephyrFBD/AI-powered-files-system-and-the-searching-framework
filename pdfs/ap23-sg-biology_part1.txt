Question 1: Interpreting and Evaluating Experimental Results  
with Experimental Design 
9 points 
In eukaryotic microorganisms, the PHO signaling pathway regulates the expression of certain genes. These 
genes, Pho target genes, encode proteins involved in regulating phosphate homeostasis. When the level of 
extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) is high, a transcriptional activator Pho4 is phosphorylated by a complex 
of two proteins, Pho80–Pho85. As a result, the Pho target genes are not expressed. When the level of 
extracellular Pi is low, the activity of the Pho80–Pho85 complex is inhibited by another protein, Pho8
