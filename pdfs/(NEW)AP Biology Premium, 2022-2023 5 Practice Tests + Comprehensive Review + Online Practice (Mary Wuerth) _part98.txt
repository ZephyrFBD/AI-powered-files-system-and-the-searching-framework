uch higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acids than the
membrane surrounding cell B. Predict which cell would have a more flexible membrane.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at which 50% of double-stranded DNA is separated
into single-stranded DNA. The greater the guanine-cytosine (poly-GC) of the DNA, the higher the Tm
compared to DNA with more adenine-thymine (poly-AT) content. The following graph shows the Tm of a
poly-AT DNA strand, a poly-GC DNA strand, and DNA from two different organisms (A and B).
(a) Describe how the Tm of DNA from organism A compares to the Tm of DNA from organism B.
(b) Describe the differences between the Tm of poly-AT and the Tm of poly-GC DNA.
(c) DNA sequencing finds that DNA from organism A has a GC content of 39% and that DNA from organism
B has a GC content of 48%. A student claims that DNA from organism C (with a GC content of 55%)
would have a Tm greater than 85Â° Celsius. Usi
