Sex Determination
Mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous
for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome causes the
development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some
insects and plants.
Avian sex determination is dependent on the presence of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male
and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar
to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this
system.
The sex of some species is not determined by genetics but
