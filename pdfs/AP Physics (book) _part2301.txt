1–2 Faraday’s Law of Induction; Lenz’s Law
Faraday investigated quantitatively what factors influence the magnitude of the emf
induced. He found first of all that the more rapidly the magnetic field changes, the
greater the induced emf. He also found that the induced emf depends on the area
of the circuit loop (and also the angle it makes with ). In fact, it is found that the
emf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux,
passing through
the circuit or loop of area A. Magnetic flux for a uniform magnetic field through
a loop of area A is defined as

Here 
is the component of the magnetic field 
perpendicular to the face of the
loop, and 
is the angle between 
and a line perpendicular to the face of the
loop. These quantities are shown in Fig. 21–3 for a square loop of side whose
area is 
When the face of the loop is parallel to

When
