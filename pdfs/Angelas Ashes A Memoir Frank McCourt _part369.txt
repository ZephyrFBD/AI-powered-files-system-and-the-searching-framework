ing for Ireland since the beginning 
 
 of time and look at the state of the country. 
 
 It’s bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he 
 
 drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the 
 
 morning she has the bitter face and she won’t talk to him. He has his 
 
 tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country.When 
 
 he returns in the evening she still won’t talk to him and she won’t make 
 
 his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there’s no way 
 
 of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of 
 
 a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. 
 
 He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting 
 
 sound.When she’s not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and 
 
 we know we’re not supposed to talk to him either for fear she’ll give us 
 
 the bitter look.We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you 
 
 can make anyone suffer
