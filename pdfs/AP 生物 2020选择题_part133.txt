(B)
Justify the decision of the researchers to hold lighting conditions constant in 
their experiment.
•	Since pigeons clean their feathers by sight, variable light conditions would 
affect the effectiveness of this behavior.

(C)
Predict the most likely effect of the pigeons cleaning their feathers on the 
phenotypes of the lice after four years.
Accept one of the following:
•	Louse phenotypes that blended with their host’s feather color would increase 
in frequency.
•	Louse phenotypes that contrasted with their host’s feather color would 
decrease in frequency.

(D)
Provide reasoning to support your prediction in part (C).
•	Lice with a contrasting coloration to the host feathers were removed before 
they could reproduce. Lice with a similar coloration to the host feathers 
survived to reproduce.
