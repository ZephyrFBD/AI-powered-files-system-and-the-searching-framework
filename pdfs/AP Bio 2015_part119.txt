ed skin cells secrete a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF). 
Epidermal (skin) cells in the vicinity of the injury possess proteins in their cell membranes called 
epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). 
(a) Identify the THREE major stages of interphase, and describe the sequence in which they occur. 
Identification (3 points maximum) 
Growth/G1
DNA Synthesis/S
Preparation for mitosis/G2 
Description (1 point) 
Growth, DNA synthesis, preparation for mitosis/G1, S, G2 
(b) Describe the most likely role of EGF and the role of EGFR in a cell signaling pathway. Describe 
how the cellular response to EGF results in tissue repair. 
Description (3 points maximum) 
EGF is a ligand/binds to EGFR/activates the receptor 
Activated receptor (EGFR) initiates cell signaling pathway/internal signaling cascade 
Cellular response initiates cell cycle progression/cell division
