Give It Some Thought
Xenon is the heaviest stable noble gas with a molar mass of 131 g>mol. Do any  
of the gases listed in Table 10.1 have molar masses larger than Xe?

CHAPTER 10 Gases
In the seventeenth century, many scientists and philosophers believed that the 
atmosphere had no weight. Evangelista Torricelli (1608–1647), a student of Galileo’s, 
proved this untrue. He invented the barometer (Figure 10.2), which is made from a glass 
tube more than 760 mm long that is closed at one end, completely filled with mercury, 
and inverted into a dish of mercury. (Care must be taken so that no air gets into the tube.) 
When the tube is inverted into the dish, some of the mercury flows out of the tube, but a 
column of mercury remains in the tube. Torricelli argued that the
