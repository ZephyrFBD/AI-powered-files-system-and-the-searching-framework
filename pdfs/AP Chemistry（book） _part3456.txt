he accompanying graph illustrates the decay of 88
42Mo, 
which decays via positron emission. (a) What is the half-
life of the decay? (b) What is the rate constant for the 
decay? (c) What fraction of the original sample of 88
42Mo 
remains after 12 min? (d) What is the product of the decay 
process? [Section 21.4]
