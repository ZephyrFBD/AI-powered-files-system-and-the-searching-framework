e disorders are not always passed on to
male oﬀspring; a mother who is simply a carrier for the disorder could pass on her
unaﬀected X chromosome. (C) is incorrect because a human female needs to have the
recessive allele on both of her X chromosomes in order to be aﬀected. (D) is incorrect
because human males only have one X chromosome, so they only need one copy to be
aﬀected.
3. D
While neither electrons nor protons are directly transferred from glucose to oxygen, both
are indirectly combined with oxygen to form water. The second equation shows the “big
picture,” wherein glucose loses hydrogen atoms and oxygen gains hydrogen atoms (and
electrons) to form water. (D) is thus correct.
4. A
The first equation shown is photosynthesis, the process by which plants harvest the
Sun’s energy to fix carbon dioxide and produce glucose. An important step in the light-
independent reactions of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle, involves the reduction of fixed
carbon dioxide to the three-carbon pre
