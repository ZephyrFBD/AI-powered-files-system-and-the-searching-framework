rotein or nucleic acid. Thus, an acid digestion of a protein followed 
by column or thin layer chromatography can be used to determine the amino acid 
composition (combination), while the use of a biochemical procedure can be used 
to determine the sequence (permutation) of that same protein with that particular 
composition.

As students work through various problems, it is important for them to discuss the 
heuristics or algorithms that they are developing. Likewise, they should share visual 
tools, such as concept maps, Punnett squares, forked-lined diagrams, pedigrees, maps, 
graphs, trees, charts, and tables that help them identify goals, patterns, wrong avenues, or

How does one prepare students for discovering meaningful patterns in the masses of 
biological information that are readily available in public databases (and that grow 
larger every day)? One such area emphasized in the c
