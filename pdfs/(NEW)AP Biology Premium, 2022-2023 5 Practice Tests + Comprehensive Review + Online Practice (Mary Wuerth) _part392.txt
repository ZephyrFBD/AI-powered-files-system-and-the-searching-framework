merase
and results in reduced gene expression.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules can also affect gene expression. siRNA is single-stranded and binds
to complementary mRNA molecules, forming double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules. Enzymes in the cell detect
and destroy these dsRNA molecules, resulting in no translation of the targeted mRNA molecules and reduced gene
expression.
Gene Expression Helps Cells Specialize
The regulation of gene expression results in different genes being expressed in different cells (also known as
differential gene expression). This differential gene expression influences the functions of cells and the resulting
phenotype of the organism. Different tissue types express different genes, which results in cell differentiation.
The phenotype of an organism is determined not only by which genes are expressed but also by the levels at
which the genes are expressed. For example, a skin cell expressing higher levels of the melanin protein would
appear darker in
