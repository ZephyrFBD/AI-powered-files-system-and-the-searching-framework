20. (III) The pendulum in a grandfather clock is made of brass
and keeps perfect time at 17°C. How much time is gained or
lost in a year if the clock is kept at 29°C? (Assume the fre-
quency dependence on length for a simple pendulum applies.)

21. (I) Absolute zero is what temperature on the Fahrenheit
scale?
22. (II) Typical temperatures in the interior of the Earth and
Sun are about 4000°C and
respectively.
(a) What are these temperatures in kelvins? (b) What 
percent error is made in each case if a person forgets to
change °C to K?

23. (I) If 
of a gas initially at STP is placed under a
pressure of 3.20 atm, the temperature of the gas rises to
38.0°C. What is the volume?
24. (I) In an internal combustion engine, air at atmospheric
pressure and a temperature of about 20°C is compressed 
in the cylinder by a piston to 
of its original volume 
(compression 
). Estimate the temperature of
