ntain carbon atoms are called inorganic compounds. For example, salt (NaCl) is an inorganic compound.
Carbon is important for life because it is a versatile atom, meaning that it has the ability to bind not only with other
carbons but also with a number of other elements including nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. The resulting
molecules are key in carrying out the activities necessary for life.
To recap:
Organic compounds contain carbon atoms AND hydrogen atoms (and sometimes other
things too).
Inorganic compounds don’t contain both carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms.
Now let’s focus on the following four classes of organic compounds central to life on Earth:
carbohydrates
proteins
lipids
nucleic acids
Most macromolecules are chains of building blocks, called polymers. The individual building blocks of a polymer
are called monomers.
A Structured Approach
While it’s a good idea to be familiar with the variety of molecules and to know
how they differ, note that for the AP Exam, you will not
