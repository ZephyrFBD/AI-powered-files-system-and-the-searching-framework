opulation can be explained this way:
Imagine that a lava flow suddenly covered an expansive plain,
substantially darkening it, while leaving the adjacent highlands
unaffected and light-colored. What was once a large, light,
homogeneous area became divided into two differently colored
regions. The animals that once moved freely across the plains
now had to contend with two different environments, and the
two populations became separated by this change in the
environment. Thus, they became two distinct populations over
time.
In this scenario, as shown on the graph in part (c), one original

bell-shaped population (that included a wide variety of
individuals) evolved into two distinct populations. Dark-
colored animals were safer in the darker regions and tended to
remain in that environment. Light-colored animals were safer
in the lighter regions and tended to remain in that environment.
Over time, pressure from the environment c
