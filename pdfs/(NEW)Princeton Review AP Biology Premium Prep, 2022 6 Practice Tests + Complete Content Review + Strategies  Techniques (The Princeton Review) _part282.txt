 to produce trisomy-7
(C) Nondisjunction of chromosome 8 to produce monosomy-8
(D) Deletion of 400 base pairs, resulting in the loss of an enhancer
Summary
Sometimes cells do not need to pass any molecules through the membrane, but instead they just pass a message.
This is signal transduction. A ligand binds to a receptor on the outside of the cell and causes changes to the
inside of the cell. Ligand-gated ion channels, catalytic receptors, and G-protein-linked receptors are common
examples.
The cell cycle is divided into interphase and mitosis, or cellular division.
The three stages of interphase are G1, G2, and S phase.
S phase is the “synthesis” phase, when chromosomes replicate.
Growth and preparation for mitosis occur in G1 and G2.
Cell cycle progression is controlled by checkpoint pathways and CDK/cyclin complexes.
Cancer occurs when cells grow abnormally and spread to other parts of the body. Tumor-suppressor genes are
genes that prevent the cell from dividing when it shouldn’t.
