transmitted through meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and
plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles
for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the
gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other
gametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual
producing gametes. But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow
alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that
the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two
genes increases, the probability of one or
