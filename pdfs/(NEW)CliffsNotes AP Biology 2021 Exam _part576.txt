he release of ADP and Pi. This, in turn, causes a change in shape of the myosin head from its high
energy to its low energy state, which generates a sliding movement of the actin toward the center of the sarcomere.
This pulls the two Z-lines together, effectively contracting the muscle fiber.
5. ATP causes the cross bridges to unbind. When a new ATP molecule attaches to the myosin head, the cross
bridge between the actin and myosin breaks, returning the myosin head to its unattached position.
Without the addition of a new ATP molecule, the cross bridges remain attached to the actin filaments. This is why
corpses are stiff. (New ATP molecules are unavailable.)
Neurons form specialized synapses with muscles called neuromuscular junctions. Muscle contraction is stimulated
through the following steps:
1. Action potential generates release of acetylcholine. When an action potential of a neuron reaches the
neuromuscular junction, the neuron secretes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which
