om organic molecules into useful energy for the
cell. The most common energy molecule in the cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
More Mitochondria = More Energy
Since mitochondria are the cell’s powerhouses, you’re likely to find more of
them in cells that require a lot of energy. Muscle cells, for example, are rich in
mitochondria.
The mitochondrion is usually an easy organelle to recognize because it has a unique oblong shape and a
characteristic double membrane consisting of an inner portion and an outer portion. The inner mitochondrial
membrane forms folds known as cristae and separates the innermost area called the matrix from the intermembrane
space. The outer membrane separates the intermembrane space from the cytoplasm. As we’ll see later, most of the
production of ATP is done on the cristae. Having folds in the membrane increases the surface area for making ATP.
Lysosomes
Throughout the cell are small, membrane-enclosed structures called lysosomes. These tiny sacs carry dige
