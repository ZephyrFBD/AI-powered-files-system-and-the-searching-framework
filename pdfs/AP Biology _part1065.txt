Dicotyledon A subdivision of flowering plants whose members possess an
embryonic seed leaf made of two halves or cotyledons.
Dihybrid cross A cross between individuals that are hybrid for two
different traits, such as height and seed color.

layer called the mesoglea. Animal phyla that are diploblastic are the
Porifera (sponges) and the Cnidaria (jellyfish and hydra).
Directional selection Selection in which one phenotype replaces another

Disruptive selection Selection that increases the extreme types in a
population at the expense of intermediate forms.
Divergent evolution Evolution that occurs when a population becomes
isolated (for any reason) from the rest of the species, becomes exposed
to new selective pressures, and evolves into a new species.
