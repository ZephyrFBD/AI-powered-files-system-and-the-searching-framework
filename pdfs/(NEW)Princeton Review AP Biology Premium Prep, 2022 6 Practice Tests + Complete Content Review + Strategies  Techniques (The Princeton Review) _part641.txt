set different temperatures and then measure
the germination rate. The outdoor temperature is interesting, but it is too variable to be a good control for
the groups with a set temperature.

D
Sympatric speciation occurs when there is no geographic barrier separating the two species (as is the case
here). Allopatric speciation requires a geographic barrier.

B
Every cell in an organism has the same set of genes. Differences in the timing and expression levels of
these genes lead to structural and functional differences.

C
Deoxygenated blood flows through all chambers before going to the lungs. This means the correct answer
is chambers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

C
The action potentials cause the heart to contract. If chamber 3 is full of more blood, then that would
indicate that the preceding chamber, chamber 2 (right atrium), had suddenly contracted a larger amount.

B
Normal cells can become cancerous when a virus invades the cell and takes over the replicative
machinery. This wo
