ds at their active sites.
(B) Ritzolinine is stabilized in the presence of Vitamin C.
(C) Ascorbic acid and JB-76 each have a pocket of negatively charged amino acids.
(D) JB-76 and ascorbic acid have an identical number of amino acids.
7. Which is the best explanation for the differing effects on reaction rate caused by ascorbic acid at low and high
concentrations of JB-76?
(A) At high concentrations of JB-76, there are fewer free active sites for the ascorbic acid to bind to.
(B) At low concentrations of JB-76, there are fewer free allosteric sites for the RZN45 to bind to.
(C) At high concentrations of JB-76, there are more free allosteric sites for the ascorbic acid to bind to.
(D) At low concentrations of JB-76, there are more free active sites for the RZN45 to bind to.
8. A patient with Ritzolierre’s Disease would likely benefit from which of the following:
   I. Injections of RZN45
​ II. Injections of JB-76
III. Injections of ascorbic acid
(A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D)
