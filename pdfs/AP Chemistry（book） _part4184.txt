e OH- ion for bases.  
page 668 CH3NH2 is the base because it accepts a H+ from H2S as 
the reaction moves from the left-hand to the right-hand side of the 
equation. page 671 As the conjugate base of a strong acid, we 
would classify ClO4
  - as having negligible basicity. page 675 pH 
is defined as -log3H+4. This quantity will become negative if the 
H+ concentration exceeds 1 M, which is possible. Such a solution 
would be highly acidic. page 677 pH = 14.00 - 3.00 = 11.00. 
This solution is basic because pH 7 7.0. page 679 Both NaOH 
and Ba1OH22 are soluble hydroxides. Therefore, the hydrox-
ide concentrations will be 0.001 M for NaOH and 0.002 M for 
Ba1OH22. Because the Ba1OH22 solution has a higher 3OH-4, it is 
more basic and has a higher pH. page 680 Because CH3
  - is the 
conjugate base of a substance that has negligible acidity, CH3
  -  
must be a strong base. Bases stronger than OH- abstract H+ from 
water molecules: CH3
