eater in the tube with oxygen than in the tube 
without oxygen? 
(A) The rate of proton pumping across the inner 
mitochondrial membrane is lower in the 
sample without oxygen. 
(B) Electron transport is reduced in the absence 
of a plasma membrane. 
(C) In the absence of oxygen, oxidative 
phosphorylation produces more ATP than 
does fermentation.

Table I shows the results of breeding experiments to examine the inheritance of flower color (purple versus white) 
and pod shape (inflated versus constricted). For the crosses recorded in Table I, true-breeding parents were crossed 
to produce F1 offspring, which were then testcrossed to homozygous recessive individuals. Table II shows the results 
of computer-simulated crosses to model the inheritance of leaf s
