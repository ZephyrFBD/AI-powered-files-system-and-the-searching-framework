between 
sodium bicarbonate in the baking soda and acetic 
acid in the vinegar.
 
3.1 ▶ Chemical Equations Use chemical 
formulas to write equations representing 
chemical reactions.
 
3.2 ▶ Simple Patterns of Chemical 
Reactivity Examine some simple 
chemical reactions: combination reactions, 
decomposition reactions, and combustion 
reactions.
 
3.3 ▶ Formula Weights Learn to obtain 
quantitative information from chemical 
formulas by using formula weights.
 
3.4 ▶ Avogadro’s Number and the 
Mole Use chemical formulas to relate the 
masses of substances to the numbers of 
atoms, molecules, or ions contained in the 
substances, a relationship that leads to the 
crucially important concept of the mole, 
defined as 6.022 * 1023 objects (atoms, 
molecules, ions, and so on).
 
3.5 ▶ Empirical Formulas from 
Analyses Apply the mole concept to 
determine chemical formulas from the 
masses of each element in a given quantity 
of a compound.
 
3.6 ▶ Quantitative Information from 
Balanced Equ
