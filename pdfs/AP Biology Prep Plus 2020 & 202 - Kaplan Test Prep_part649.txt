e male is probably
homozygous dominant for both traits.

5. The pedigree diagram below shows the inheritance of a rare
disorder over three generations. Circles represent females, and
squares represent males. Shaded symbols indicate individuals
with the disorder.
An individual with a rare disorder investigated the incidence of the
disorder in his family and drew the pedigree diagram above. He
contends that the gene for the disorder is on the mitochondrial

cytoplasm of the egg. The sperm does not donate mitochondria.
Is he correct? Why or why not?
He is correct. The pedigree supports mitochondrial inheritance.
All children of aﬀected women have the disorder. No children

likely to have the disorder than females.
(B)
He is incorrect. The pedigree supports autosomal dominant
