entrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient
increases as it moves deeper into the medulla. Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions, as
illustrated in Figure 32.9, it acts as a countercurrent multiplier. The vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent
exchanger.

Figure 32.9 The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration
gradients. The descending limb is water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so
osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal medulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher
inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na+ and Cl– ions exit through
ion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na+ is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl–
follows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).
