n produced can also change the phenotype of an organism. Mutations provide
genetic variation in populations. These variations are acted upon by natural selection and can lead to the evolution of
populations.
Two of the most common aneuploidies in humans are Klinefelter syndrome and Down syndrome (also known as trisomy 21). Individuals with
Klinefelter syndrome have three sex chromosomes: two X and one Y. Individuals with Down syndrome typically have three copies of
chromosome 21.
Not all mutations are harmful. The organism’s environment determines whether a mutation is beneficial, harmful,
or has no effect on the survival of the organism. If the organism’s environment changes, the benefit or harm a
mutation confers on the organism can change. Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein
at all because of the redundancy of the genetic code.
Mutations can be caused by environmental factors, such as chemicals or radiation, or by random errors in DNA
replication or DNA
