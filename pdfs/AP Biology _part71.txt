ls have a nucleus bound by a double membrane.
Eukaryotic cells also have organelles and internal membranes that
compartmentalize each cell so that complex chemical reactions can be
carried out efficiently in separate regions of a cell. All cells of the human
body are eukaryotic cells; see Figures 3.1, 3.5 and Table 3.1.
