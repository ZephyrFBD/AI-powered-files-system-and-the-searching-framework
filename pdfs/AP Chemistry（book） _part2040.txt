 bond dipoles. The attraction between the polar water molecules and the nonpolar 
hydrocarbon molecules is not sufficiently strong to allow the formation of a solution. 
Nonpolar liquids tend to be insoluble in polar liquids, as Figure 13.8 shows for hexane 1C6H142 
and water.
Many organic compounds have polar groups attached to a nonpolar frame-
work of carbon and hydrogen atoms. For example, the series of organic compounds in 
 
Table 13.2 all contain the polar OH group. Organic compounds with this molecular fea-
ture are called alcohols. The O ¬H bond is able to form hydrogen bonds. For example, 
ethanol 1CH3CH2OH2 molecules can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules as 
well as with each other (Figure 13.9). As a result, the solute–solute, solvent–solvent, and 
solute–solvent forces are not greatly different in a mixture of CH3CH2OH and H2O. No 
major change occurs in the environments of the molecules as they are mixed. Therefore, 
the increased entropy when the components mix pl
