digests DNA), and extract C with RNase H (which digests RNA).
Aȇer treatment with enzymes, each extract is incubated with live
lac– cells and grown on a medium containing an indicator. Blue
colonies indicate that lactose is being fermented. Colorless
colonies indicate that the cells cannot ferment lactose.
Which of the following would most likely be observed aȇer
growing the cultures?
Only colorless colonies appear from cells incubated with
extract A.
(A)
Only colorless colonies appear from cells incubated with
extract B.
(B)
Only colorless colonies appear from cells incubated with
extract C.
(C)
Blue colonies appear from cells grown with all three extracts.
(D)
3. A molecular biologist is studying a mutant strain of E. coli that has
a defect occurring during DNA replication. In order to understand
the cells’ mutation, she labels the cells with radioactive thymidine
to monitor the synthesis of DNA. Aȇer several hours of incubation,
she recovers both long and short strands of label
