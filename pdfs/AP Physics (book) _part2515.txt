e object going in many
directions (as in Fig. 23–1), but only those that enclose the bundle of rays that
enter the eye from each of the two points are shown. Each set of diverging rays
that reflect from the mirror and enter the eye appear to come from a single point
behind the mirror, called the image point, as shown by the dashed lines. That is,
our eyes and brain interpret any rays that enter an eye as having traveled straight-
line paths. The point from which each bundle of rays seems to come is one point
on the image. For each point on the object, there is a corresponding image point.
(This analysis of how a plane mirror forms an image was published by Kepler in
1604.)
FIGURE 23–6 When you look in a

and objects around you. You don’t

because left and right appear
