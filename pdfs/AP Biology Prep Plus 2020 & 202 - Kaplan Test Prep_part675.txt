7. The common cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of other birds so
that other species will take on the costs of raising the baby
cuckoos. The ashy-throated parrotbill is one species of bird that is
parasitized by the cuckoo in this way. Based on this information,
what selection pressures are most likely faced by cuckoo
populations that parasitize parrotbills?
There is strong selection pressure on the cuckoos to produce
distinctive eggs that can be quickly recognized as unique.
(A)
There is strong selection pressure on the cuckoos to produce
large eggs so that their oﬀspring can outcompete parrotbill
oﬀspring.
(B)
There is strong selection pressure on the cuckoos to produce
eggs with variable coloration to increase the likelihood that
some will resemble parrotbill eggs.
(C)
There is strong selection pressure on the cuckoos to produce
eggs that are as similar as possible to those of the parrotbills.
