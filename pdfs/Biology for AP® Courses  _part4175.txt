lation sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary
processes affecting diversity.
For example, Karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants. Mutualism is a form of a long-
term relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each species benefits. For mutualism to
exist between individual organisms, each species must receive some benefit from the other as a consequence of the
relationship. Researchers have shown that there is an increase in the probability of survival when Karner blue butterfly
larvae (caterpillars) are tended by ants. This might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage when tended
by ants, which provides an advantage for the larvae. Meanwhile, the Karner blue butterfly larvae secrete a carbohydrate-
rich substance that is an important energy source for the ants. Both the Karner blue larvae and the ants benefit from their
interaction.
