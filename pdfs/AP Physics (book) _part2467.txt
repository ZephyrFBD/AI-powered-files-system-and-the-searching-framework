Solar pressure. Radiation from the Sun that
reaches the Earth’s surface (after passing through the atmosphere) transports
energy at a rate of about 
Estimate the pressure and force exerted
by the Sun on your outstretched hand.
APPROACH The radiation is partially reflected and partially absorbed, so let
us estimate simply
SOLUTION
An estimate of the area of your outstretched hand might be about 10 cm by 
20 cm, so 
Then the force is
NOTE These numbers are tiny. The force of gravity on your hand, for compari-
son, is maybe a half pound, or with
The radiation pressure on your hand is imperceptible compared to gravity.
