of guaiacol will represent the relative changes that
occurred during the reaction. You will use reference tubes (ranging from 1
to 10) to compare the relative amounts of oxygen produced.

Mash up and liquefy a piece of turnip, and then filter it with cheesecloth
and filter paper. Next, add the filtrate to distilled water to make your stock
solution of peroxidase. To be consistent, use the same stock solution of
peroxidase for every experiment.
Combine the H2O2 solution with the peroxidase enzyme at 4Â°C, and
begin timing and observing the color changes. Take measurements at
appropriate intervals (i.e., every 30 seconds). Repeat this procedure for
different temperatures. Record your data.
A spectrophotometer has a detector that measures the transmittance or
absorbance of light of a sample, depending upon how you set the dials.
Transmittance refers to the amount of light that passes through the
sample and strikes the detector. A perfec
