respiration.
(A)
Red blood cells generate ATP and NADH via anaerobic
fermentation.
(B)
Red blood cells metabolize glucose via glycolysis followed by
carbon dioxide and ethanol production to produce ATP.

4. Thermogenin, an uncoupling protein found in brown adipose
tissue, increases the permeability of the inner mitochondrial
membrane. Which of the following accurately describes how the
uncoupler aï¬€ects the electron transport chain?
Thermogenin decreases the proton gradient and thus
decreases ATP production.
(A)
Thermogenin decreases the proton gradient and thus
increases ATP production.
(B)
Thermogenin increases the proton gradient and thus
decreases ATP production.
(C)
Thermogenin increases the proton gradient and thus
increases ATP production.
(D)
