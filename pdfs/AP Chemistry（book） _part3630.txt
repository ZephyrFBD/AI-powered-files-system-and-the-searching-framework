 22.86  (a) The P4, P4O6 and P4O10 molecules have a common struc-
tural feature of four P atoms arranged in a tetrahedron 
(Figures 22.27 and 22.28). Does this mean that the bonding 
between the P atoms is the same in all these cases? Explain. 
(b) Sodium trimetaphosphate 1Na3P3O92 and sodium 
tetrametaphosphate 1Na4P4O122 are used as water-softening 
agents. They contain cyclic P3O9
