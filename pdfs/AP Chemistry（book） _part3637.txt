roduces a greater thrust per 
gram total mass of oxidizer plus fuel? (Assume that both 
fuels generate the same temperature and that H2O1g2 is 
formed.)
 22.104  Borazine, 1BH231NH23, is an analog of C6H6, benzene. It can 
be prepared from the reaction of diborane with ammonia, 
with hydrogen as another product; or from lithium boro-
hydride and ammonium chloride, with lithium chloride 
and hydrogen as the other products. (a) Write balanced 
chemical equations for the production of borazine using 
both synthetic methods. (b) Draw the Lewis dot structure 
of borazine. (c) How many grams of borazine can be pre-
pared from 2.00 L of ammonia at STP
, assuming diborane is 
in excess?

designing an Experiment
You are given samples of five substances. At room temperature, 
three are colorless gases, one is a colorless liquid, and one is a white 
solid. You are told that the substances are NF3, PF3, PCl3, PF5, and 
PCl5. Letâ€™s design experiments to determine which
