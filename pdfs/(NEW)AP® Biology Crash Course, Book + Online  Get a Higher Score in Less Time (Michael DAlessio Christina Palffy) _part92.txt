 G as
nitrogenous bases, deoxyribose as 5 carbon sugar, and phosphate. RNA consists of A, U, G, C as nitrogenous bases, ribose as
5-carbon sugar, and phosphate. Structurally DNA is a double-stranded helix, while RNA is single-stranded.

DNA Structure
A. The structure of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule is based on the pairing of nucleotides along the
lengths of two complementary DNA strands, each of which has a sugar-phosphate backbone and twists to
form a double helix.
B. Sugar-phosphate backbone—of each DNA strand is a repeating chain of the 5-carbon sugar, deoxyribose,
and a phosphate group composed of a phosphorus atom surrounded by 4 oxygen atoms.
1. The sugar-phosphate chains are held together by covalent bonds that are generally only broken or
formed by enzymes.
2. The sugar-phosphate backbone of each strand is an identical feature of all DNA molecules.
C. Nitrogenous bases—attached to each sugar is one of the four nitrogenous bases composed of carbon and
nitrogen ring
