In Section 19.3 we will see that this increase in entropy is a measure 
of the increased randomness of the molecules due to the expansion.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The key idea of the first law of thermodynamics is that energy is conserved in any pro-
cess. 
 (Section 5.2) Is entropy also conserved in a spontaneous process in the same 
way that energy is conserved?
Let’s try to answer this question by calculating the entropy change of a system and 
the entropy change of its surroundings when our system is 1 mol of ice (a piece roughly 
the size of an ice cube) melting in the palm of your hand, which is part of the surround-
ings. The process is not reversible because the system and surroundings are at different 
temperatures. Nevertheless, because ∆S is a sta
