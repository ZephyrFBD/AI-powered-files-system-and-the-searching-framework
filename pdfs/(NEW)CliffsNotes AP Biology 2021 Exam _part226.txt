ustrates the production of gametes by meiosis and subsequent growth by mitosis (Figure
7-5). Note that the number of chromosomes in diploid and haploid cells is indicated by 2n and n, respectively.
Human cells (except gametes) contain 46 chromosomes (23 homologous pairs). Thus, 2n = 46. For human gametes,
n = 23. In humans, gametes are produced in the reproductive organsâ€”the ovaries and the testes.

Genetic Variation
In mitosis, barring an error in DNA replication (mutation), every daughter cell is exactly like the parent cell. Meiosis
and sexual reproduction, however, result in a reassortment of the genetic material. This reassortment, called genetic
recombination, originates from three events during the reproductive cycle:
1. Crossing over. During prophase I, nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange pieces of genetic
material. As a result each homologue no longer entirely represents a single parent.
2. Independent assortment of homologues. During metaphase I,
