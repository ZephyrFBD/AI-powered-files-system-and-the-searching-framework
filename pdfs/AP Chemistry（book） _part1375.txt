electron domains, 
are summarized in Table 9.1. If you compare the geometries in Table 9.1 with those in 
 
Figure 9.3, you will see that they are the same.
The shapes of different ABn molecules or ions depend on the number  
of electron domains surrounding the central atom.
The arrangement of electron domains about the central atom of an ABn molecule or 
ion is called its electron-domain geometry. In contrast, the molecular geometry 
is the arrangement of only the atoms in a molecule or ionâ€”any nonbonding pairs in the 
molecule are not part of the description of the molecular geometry.
Applying the VSEpr Model to Determine Molecular Shapes
In determining the shape of any molecule, we first use the VSEPR model to predict the 
 
electron-domain geometry. From knowing how many of the domains are due to nonbond-
ing pairs, we can then predict the molecular geometry. When all the electron domains in a 
molecule arise from bonds, the molecular geometry is identical to the electron-domain ge
