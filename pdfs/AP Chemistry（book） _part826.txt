roton is increased to 1.0 nm? 
(c) Does the potential energy of the two particles increase or 
decrease when the distance is increased to 1.0 nm?
 5.14 (a) What is the electrostatic potential energy (in joules) be-
tween two protons that are separated by 62 pm? (b) What 
is the change in potential energy if the distance separating 
the two is increased to 1.0 nm? (c) Does the potential en-
ergy of the two particles increase or decrease when the dis-
tance is increased to 1.0 nm?
 5.15 (a) The electrostatic force (not energy) of attraction between 
two oppositely charged objects is given by the equation 
F = k1Q 1Q 2>d22 where k = 8.99 * 109 N@m2>C2, Q1 and 
Q2 are the charges of the two objects in Coulombs, and d is 
the distance separating the two objects in meters. What is 
the electrostatic force of attraction (in Newtons) between an 
electron and a proton that are separated by 1.00 * 102 pm? 
(b) The force of gravity acting between two objects is given 
by the equation F = G1m1m2>d
