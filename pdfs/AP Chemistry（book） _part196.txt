 in the numerator.
Note that you could have used 100 cm = 1 m as a conversion factor as well in the 
second parentheses. As long as you keep track of your given units and cancel them prop-
erly to obtain the desired units, you are likely to be successful in your calculations.
Calculators are wonderful devices; they enable you to get to the 
wrong answer very quickly. Of course, that’s not the destination you 
want. You can take certain steps to avoid putting that wrong answer 
into your homework set or on an exam. One is to keep track of the 
units in a calculation and use the correct conversion factors. Second, 
you can do a quick mental check to be sure that your answer is rea-
sonable: you can try to make a “ballpark” estimate.
A ballpark estimate involves making a rough calculation using 
numbers that are rounded off in such a way that the arithmetic can 
be done without a calculator. Even though this approach does not 
give an exact answer, it gives one that is roughly the correct
