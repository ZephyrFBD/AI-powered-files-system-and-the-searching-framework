Writing Chemical Equations for a Neutralization Reaction
For the reaction between aqueous solutions of acetic acid 1CH3COOH2 and barium hydroxide, Ba1OH22, write (a) the balanced 
molecular equation, (b) the complete ionic equation, (c) the net ionic equation.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the chemical formulas for an acid and a base 
and asked to write a balanced molecular equation, a complete 
ionic equation, and a net ionic equation for their neutralization 
reaction.
Plan As Equation 4.11 and the italicized statement that follows it 
indicate, neutralization reactions form two products, H2O and a 
salt. We examine the cation of the base and the anion of the acid 
to determine the composition of the salt.
Solve
(a)  
The salt contains the cation of the base 1Ba2+2 and the 
anion of the acid 1CH3COO-2. Thus, the salt formula is 
Ba1CH3COO22. According to Table 4.1, this compound is 
soluble in water. The unbalanced molecular equation for the 
neutralization reaction
