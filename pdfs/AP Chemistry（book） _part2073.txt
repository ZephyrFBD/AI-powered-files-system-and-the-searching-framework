pressure of the water above this solution is 
 
80.0 % of that of pure water:
 
P
solution = 10.8002117.5 torr2 = 14.0 torr 
The presence of the nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of the volatile solvent by 
17.5 torr - 14.0 torr = 3.5 torr.
The vapor–pressure lowering, ∆P, is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the 
solute, Xsolute :
 
∆P = Xsolute P°

Thus, for the example of the solution of glucose in water, we have
 
∆P = XC6H12O6 P°
H2O = 10.2002117.5 torr2 = 3.50 torr 
The vapor–pressure lowering caused by adding a nonvolatile solute depends on the 
total concentration of solute particles, regardless of whether they are molecules or ions. 
Remember that vapor–pressure lowering is a colligative property, so its value for any solu-
tion depends on the concentration of solute particles and not on their kind or identity.
Give It Some Thought
Does adding 1 mol of NaCl to 1 kg of water lower the vapor pressure of water to the 
same extent, a lesser e
