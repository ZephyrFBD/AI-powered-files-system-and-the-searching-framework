 Some Thought
What change in the mass number of a nucleus occurs when the nucleus emits an 
alpha particle?
Types of Radioactive Decay
The three most common kinds of radiation given off when a radionuclide decays are 
alpha 1a2, beta 1b2, and gamma 1g2 radiation. 
 (Section 2.2) Table 21.1 summarizes 
some of the important properties of these types of radiation.
Alpha Radiation As described earlier, alpha radiation consists of a stream of helium-4 
nuclei known as alpha particles, which we denote as 4
2He or simply a.

When a nucleus spontaneously decomposes in this way, it is said to be radioactive and to 
have decayed or to have undergone radioactive decay. Because an alpha particle is involved 
in this reaction, scientists also describe the p
