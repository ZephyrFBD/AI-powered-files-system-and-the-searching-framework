ere by rainfall or by dissolution in the oceans. Unfor-
tunately, the lack of reactivity that makes them commercially useful also allows them to 
survive in the atmosphere and to diffuse into the stratosphere. It is estimated that several 
million tons of chlorofluorocarbons are now present in the atmosphere.
As CFCs diffuse into the stratosphere, they are exposed to high-energy radiation, 
which can cause photodissociation. Because C¬Cl bonds are considerably weaker than 
C¬F bonds, free chlorine atoms are formed readily in the presence of light with wave-
lengths in the range from 190 to 225 nm, as shown in this typical reaction:
 
CF2Cl21g2 + hn ¡ CF2Cl1g2 + Cl1g2 
[18.6]
Calculations suggest that chlorine atom formation occurs at the greatest rate at an alti-
tude of about 30 km, the altitude at which ozone is at its highest concentration.
Atomic chlorine reacts rapidly with ozone to form chlorine monoxide and molecu-
lar oxygen:
 
Cl1g2 + O31g2 ¡ ClO1g2 + O21g2
