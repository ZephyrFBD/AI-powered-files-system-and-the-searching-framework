ng vibrates as a standing wave.)
51. (I) A particular string resonates in four loops at a frequency
of 240 Hz. Give at least three other frequencies at which 
it will resonate. What is each called?
52. (II) The speed of waves on a string is 
If the fre-
quency of standing waves is 475 Hz, how far apart are two
adjacent nodes?

53. (II) If two successive overtones of a vibrating string are
280 Hz and 350 Hz, what is the frequency of the fundamental?
54. (II) A guitar string is 92 cm long and has a mass of 3.4 g.
The distance from the bridge to the support post is
and the string is under a tension of 520 N.
What are the frequencies of the fundamental and first 
two overtones?
55. (II) One end of a horizontal string is attached to a small-
amplitude mechanical 60.0-Hz oscillator. The string’s mass
per unit length is
The string passes over a
pulley, a distance
away, and weights are hung
from this end, Fig. 11–55. What mass m must be hung from
this end of the str
