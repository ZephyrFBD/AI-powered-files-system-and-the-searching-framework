 or Ψtotal, a
decrease in Ψs will cause a decrease in Ψtotal. The internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water
because of the cytoplasm’s high solute content (Figure 23.32). Because of this difference in water potential water will move
from the soil into a plant’s root cells via the process of osmosis. This is why solute potential is sometimes called osmotic
potential.
Plant cells can metabolically manipulate Ψs (and by extension, Ψtotal) by adding or removing solute molecules. Therefore,
plants have control over Ψtotal via their ability to exert metabolic control over Ψs.

Figure 23.32 In this example with a semipermeable membrane between two aqueous systems, water will move
from a region of higher to lower water potential until equilibrium is reached. Solutes (Ψs), pressure (Ψp), and
gravity (Ψg) influence total water potential for eac
