 hear the news from the BBC 
 
 or Radio Eireann from other people’s wirelesses.Mrs.Meagher and her 
 
 children are gone in and there’s only the dim light of a candle from their 
 
 kitchen.They’re ashamed too.They stay inside on Saturday nights and 
 
 they don’t even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told 
 
 Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags 
 
  
  
 they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the 
 
 public assistance. Mam says that’s the worst thing that could happen to 
 
 any family. It’s worse than going on the dole, it’s worse than going to 
 
 the St.Vincent de Paul Society, it’s worse than begging on the streets 
 
 with the tinkers and the knackers. It’s the last thing you’d do to keep 
 
 yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage. 
 
 There’s a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red 
 
 and itching. Grandma says, Don’t touch that sore and don’t put water
