■ ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK  
This investigation will generally be conducted during the study of interactions (big 
idea 4). It could also be conducted during the study of cellular processes (big idea 
2). In addition, some questions uncovered by students during the initial phase of 
the investigation will connect well with evolution and natural selection (big idea 
1). As always, it is important to make connections between big ideas and enduring 
understandings, regardless of where in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts 
align with the enduring understandings and learning objectives from the AP Biology 
Curriculum Framework, as indicated below.
