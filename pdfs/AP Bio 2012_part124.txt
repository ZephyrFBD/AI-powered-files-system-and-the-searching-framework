Question 28
Essential Knowledge
3.C.1: Changes in genotype can result in changes  
in phenotype.
Science Practice
7.2: The student can connect concepts in and across 
domain(s) to generalize or extrapolate in and/or across 
enduring understandings and/or big ideas.
Learning Objective 
3.26: The student is able to explain the connection 
between genetic variations in organisms and phenotypic 
variations in populations.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the leaves in dish A could have been yellow 
because they had not been exposed to light yet and could have changed to green 
in response to light, which would not be a genetic difference. Some yellow leaves 
did change to green when exposed to light.
(B)
This option is incorrect because the only variable in this experiment was light. 
If genes responsible for leaf color also had an impact on germination rate, then 
germination should have been similar in each dish, which is not supported.
(C)
This option is incorrect because acc
