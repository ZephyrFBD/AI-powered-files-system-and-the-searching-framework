13. Can the terminal voltage of a battery ever exceed its emf?
Explain.
14. Explain in detail how you could measure the internal
resistance of a battery.
15. In an RC circuit, current flows from the battery until the
capacitor is completely charged. Is the total energy sup-
plied by the battery equal to the total energy stored by the
capacitor? If not, where does the extra energy go?
16. Given the circuit shown in Fig. 19–38, use the words
“increases,” “decreases,” or “stays the same” to complete
the following statements:
(a) If 
increases, the potential difference between A and
E __________. Assume no resistance in 
and 
(b) If 
increases, the potential difference between A and
E __________. Assume
