and is lost as heat, and the feces of organisms are
passed to decomposers.
(A)
Energy is lost as heat, gets trapped in unusable forms like bone, and
is consumed in metabolism, and the remains of dead organisms are
passed to decomposers.
(B)
Energy gets trapped in unusable forms like bone, is consumed in
metabolism, and is lost through photosynthesis, and the feces of
organisms are passed to decomposers.
(C)
Energy is consumed in metabolism, gets trapped in unusable forms
like fur, and is lost as heat, and the remains of dead organisms are
passed to apex consumers.
(D)
protein X and protein Y with respect to the regulation of the X and Y operons, the
researcher does three experiments:
Experiment 1: The researcher adds wild-type protein X at hour one to E. coli cells;
Experiment 2: The researcher adds wild-type protein Y at hour one to E. coli cells;
Experiment 3: The researcher adds both wild-type protein X and wild-type protein
Y at hour one to E. coli cells.
For each experiment, the a
