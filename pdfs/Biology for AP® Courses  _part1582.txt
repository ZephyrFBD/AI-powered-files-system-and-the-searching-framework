after the
replication fork, thereby relieving the pressure.
Single-stranded binding proteins prevent
reforming of DNA. Primase synthesizes RNA
primer which is used by DNA polymerase to
form a daughter strand. If helicase is mutated,
the DNA strands will not be joined together at
the beginning of replication.

Helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin
of replication. Topoisomerase breaks and
reforms DNA’s sugar backbone ahead of the
replication fork, thereby increasing the pressure.
