a.
The chromosomes randomly align during
metaphase I at the equator, and separation of
homologous chromosomes occurs during
anaphase I. Similarly separation of sister
chromatids occurs at anaphase II of meiosis II.
At the end of meiosis II, four different gametic
combinations are produced, each containing a
haploid set of chromosomes.
b.
The chromosomes randomly align during
anaphase I at the equator. Separation of bivalent
chromosomes occur during metaphase I of
meiosis I. Similarly, separation of sister
chromatids occurs at metaphase II of meiosis II.
