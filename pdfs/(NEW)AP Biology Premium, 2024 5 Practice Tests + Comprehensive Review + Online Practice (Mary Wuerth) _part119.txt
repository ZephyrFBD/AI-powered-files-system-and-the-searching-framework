nd a less efficient exchange of materials with the cellâ€™s environment. For this reason, it can be advantageous
for an organism to be made of many smaller cells rather than fewer large ones.
One way the surface area to volume ratio can be increased is by folding membranes, as seen in the cristae of the
inner mitochondrial membrane. The membrane folds on the inner mitochondrial membrane allow for greater surface
area for the electron transport chains that are required for cellular respiration. The lining of the human intestine has
many folds called villi that increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption.
Structure of the Plasma Membrane
Plasma membranes are critical in allowing cells to maintain an internal environment that is favorable to life.
Plasma (or cell) membranes are selectively permeable, which means that some materials can cross the membrane
while other materials cannot. This selective permeability allows the cell to maintain its internal environment.
The plasma
