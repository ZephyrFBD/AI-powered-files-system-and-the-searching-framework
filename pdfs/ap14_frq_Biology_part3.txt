1. Trichomes are hairlike outgrowths of the epidermis of plants that are thought to provide protection against being
eaten by herbivores (herbivory). In a certain plant species, stem trichome density is genetically determined.
To investigate variation in stem trichome density within the plant species, a student counted the number of
trichomes on the stems of six plants in each of three different populations. The student used the data to calculate
the mean trichome density (numbers of hairs per square centimeter) for each population. The results are provided
in the table below.
