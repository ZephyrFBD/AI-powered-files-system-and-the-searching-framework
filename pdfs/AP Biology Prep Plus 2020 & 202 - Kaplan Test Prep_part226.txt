e the nucleoprotein is actually structure 1, the
genetic material of the virus. (B) is incorrect because it reverses the
identities of structures 2 and 3. (C) is incorrect because the
neuraminidase is structure 4, a surface enzyme that facilitates viral
replication.

In step 1, the influenza virus attaches to the host cell and prepares for
infection. In step 2, the virus is engulfed by the epithelial cell and, in
step 3, the virus is released and enters the nucleus, where it will begin
replicating by using the resources of the host cell. Only in step 4 does
the viral mRNA begin synthesizing new viral proteins. (D) is thus
correct.
3. A
Learning Objective: 6.3
Minor mutations that alter the antigens of the virus are quite common
and, if enough of these mutations accumulate, can make an immune
system exposed to an earlier form of the virus unable to recognize the
new form. (A) is thus correct. (B) is incorrect because major mutations
resulting from two strains
