nd plasmids.
d.
It has a cell wall enclosing nuclear membrane,
cytoplasm, mitochondria, vacuoles and nucleoid
region with genetic material. It may have a
protective capsule, flagellum, pili and plasmids.
41. Explain the statement that both Archaea and Bacteria
have the same basic structures, but these structures are
built from different chemical components.
a.
Typical cells in Archaea and Bacteria contain a
cell wall, cell membrane, nucleoid region,
ribosomes, and often a capsule, flagellum, and
pili. However, these are sometimes made from
different chemical compounds. Cell walls of
Bacteria contain peptidoglycan while Archaea
do not. Plasma membrane lipids of Bacteria are
fatty acids while those of Archaea are phytanyl
groups.
b.
Typical cells in Archaea and Bacteria contain a
cell wall, cell membrane, nucleoid region and
often a capsule, flagellum, and pili but in some
instances different chemical compounds make
them. Cell walls of Bacteria contain
peptidoglycan while Archaea do not.
