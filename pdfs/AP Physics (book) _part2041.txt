length
of the cord (containing two wires) is 3.5 m, how much power is
dissipated in the wiring? (c) If no. 12 wire, with a diameter
of 2.053 mm, was used instead, how much power would be
dissipated in the wiring? (d) Assuming that the air condi-
tioner is run 12 h per day, how much money per month
(30 days) would be saved by using no. 12 wire? Assume
that the cost of electricity is 12 cents per kWh.
85. An electric wheelchair is designed to run on a single 12-V
battery rated to provide 100 ampere-hours (100
).
(a) How much energy is stored in this battery? (b) If the
wheelchair experiences an average total retarding force
(mainly friction) of 210 N, how far can the wheelchair travel
on one charge?
86. If a wire of resistance R is stretched uniformly so that its
length doubles, by what factor does the power dissipated
in the wire change, assuming it remains hooked up to the
same voltage source? Assume the wireâ€™s volume and density
remain constant.
87. Copper wire of diameter 0.259 cm is
