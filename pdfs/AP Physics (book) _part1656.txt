ture. Entropy increases, as we saw in Example 15â€“14. At the beginning of the process
we can distinguish two classes of molecules: those with a high average kinetic energy
(the hot object), and those with a low average kinetic energy (the cooler object).After
the process in which heat flows, all the molecules are in one class with the same average
kinetic energy; we no longer have the more orderly arrangement of molecules in two
classes. Order has gone to disorder. Furthermore, the separate hot and cold objects
could serve as the hot- and cold-temperature regions of a heat engine, and thus
could be used to obtain useful work. But once the two objects are put in contact and
reach the same temperature, no work can be obtained. Disorder has increased,
because a system that has the ability to perform work must surely be considered to
have a higher order than a system no longer able to do work.
When a stone falls to the ground, its macroscopic kinetic energy is transformed
