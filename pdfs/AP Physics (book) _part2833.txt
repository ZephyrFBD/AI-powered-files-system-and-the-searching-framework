25–10 Specialty Microscopes and Contrast
All the resolving power a microscope can attain will be useless if the object to be
seen cannot be distinguished from the background. The difference in brightness
between the image of an object and the image of the surroundings is called contrast.
Achieving high contrast is an important problem in microscopy and other forms
of imaging. The problem arises in biology, for example, because cells consist largely
of water and are almost uniformly transparent to light. We now briefly discuss
two special types of microscope that can increase contrast: the interference and
