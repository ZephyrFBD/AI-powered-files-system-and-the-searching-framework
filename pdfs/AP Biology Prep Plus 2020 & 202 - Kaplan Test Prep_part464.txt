At p = 0.05 in the chi-square table, the value obtained from the previous
equation would have to be at least 3.8 for your observations to be
statistically diﬀerent from what is expected. The value calculated was
only 0.16, so it can be concluded that although your observations weren’t
exactly 
 they were not statistically significantly diﬀerent from the
expected outcome. There are many considerations and assumptions to
make when performing statistical analyses, which would be covered in
greater depth in a class on statistical analysis. For the chi-square analysis,
there are three key points to remember:
AP EXPERT NOTE
The formula for chi-square and the degrees of freedom table will
be provided to you in the equations sheet on Test Day, so you do
not need to memorize them. You are most likely to see chi-square
tested in grid-in questions, but it could also appear in other
question types.
The formula for the chi-square statistic:
The formula for degrees of freedom: d.f. = # of categorie
