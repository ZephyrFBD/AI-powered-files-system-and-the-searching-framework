not temporary encounters, metabolism would grind to a halt.
As each amino acid is added to the next, the protein molecule grows in length
until it is complete. Even as it is being made, this chain is being buffeted about in
the cell—we might think of a wiggling worm. But a protein molecule has electrically
charged polar groups along its length. And as it takes on various shapes, the
electric forces of attraction between different parts of the molecule will even-
tually lead to a particular shape of the protein which is quite stable. Each type of
protein has its own special shape, depending on the location of charged atoms. In
the last analysis, the final shape depends on the order of the amino acids.

When atoms combine to form molecules, the probability distributions of the outer
electrons overlap and this interaction alters the energy levels. Nonetheless, mol-
ecules can undergo transitions between electron energy levels just as atoms do.
For example, the
