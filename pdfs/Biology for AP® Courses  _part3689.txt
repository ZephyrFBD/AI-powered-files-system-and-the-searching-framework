Blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste. Blood plays a protective role by
transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents or white blood
cells to sites of infection.
Figure 31.5 The cells and cellular components of human blood are shown. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the
cells and remove carbon dioxide. White blood cells—including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils—are involved in the immune response. Platelets form clots that prevent blood loss after injury.
Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythro- = “red”; -cyte = “cell”), are specialized cells that circulate through the body
delivering oxygen to cells; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow. In mammals, red blood cells are small
biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7–8 µm in size. In birds and non-
avian reptiles, a
