n approaching train or truck. In
this case the ground does not actually touch your eardrum, but the longitudinal
wave transmitted by the ground is called a sound wave just the same, since its vibra-
tions cause the outer ear and the air within it to vibrate. Sound cannot travel in
the absence of matter. For example, a bell ringing inside an evacuated jar cannot
be heard, and sound cannot travel through the empty reaches of outer space.
The speed of sound is different in different materials. In air at 0°C and 1 atm,
sound travels at a speed of 
The speed of sound in various materials is
given in Table 12–1. The values depend somewhat on temperature, especially for
gases. For example, in air near room temperature, the speed increases approxi-
mately 
for each Celsius degree increase in temperature:

where T is the temperature in °C. Unless stated otherwise, we will assume in this
