need for fertilizers or tending. Because of these differences, the energy 
return for sugarcane is much higher than the energy return for corn. 
It is estimated that for each 1.0 J of energy expended in growing and 
processing sugarcane, 8.0 J of energy is produced as bioethanol.
Other biofuels that are also becoming a major part of the world 
economy include biodiesel, a substitute for petroleum-derived diesel 
fuel. Biodiesel is typically produced from crops that have a high oil 
content, such as soybeans and canola. It can also be produced from
