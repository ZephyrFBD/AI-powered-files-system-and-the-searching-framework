act to form 
phosphorus pentachloride gas: PCl31g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ 
PCl51g2. A 7.5-L gas vessel is charged with a mixture of 
PCl31g2 and Cl21g2, which is allowed to equilibrate at 450 
K. At equilibrium the partial pressures of the three gases are 
P
PCl3 = 0.124 atm, P
Cl2 = 0.157 atm, and P
PCl5 = 1.30 atm. 
(a) What is the value of Kp at this temperature? (b) Does 
the equilibrium favor reactants or products? (c) Calculate 
Kc for this reaction at 450 K.
 15.35 A mixture of 0.10 mol of NO, 0.050 mol of H2, and 0.10 
mol of H2O is placed in a 1.0-L vessel at 300 K. The follow-
ing equilibrium is established:
2 NO1g2 + 2 H21g2 ∆ N21g2 + 2 H2O1g2
 
 At equilibrium 3NO4 = 0.062 M. (a) Calculate the equilib-
rium concentrations of H2, N2, and H2O. (b) Calculate Kc.
 15.36 A mixture of 1.374 g of H2 and 70.31 g of Br2 is heated in a 
2.00-L vessel at 700 K. These substances react according to
H21g2 + Br21g2 ∆ 2 HBr1g2
 
 At equilibrium, the vessel is found to contain 0.566 g 
of H2. (a) Calcu
