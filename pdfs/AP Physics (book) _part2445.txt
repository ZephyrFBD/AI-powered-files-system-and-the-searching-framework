FIGURE 22–6 (a) The radiation fields (far from the antenna)
produced by a sinusoidal signal on the antenna. The red
closed loops represent electric field lines. The magnetic field
lines, perpendicular to the page and represented by blue 
and 
also form closed loops. (b) Very far from the antenna,
the wave fronts (field lines) are essentially flat over a fairly
large area, and are referred to as plane waves.

The magnitudes of both 
and 
in the radiation field are found to decrease
with distance as 
(Compare this to the static electric field given by Coulomb’s
law where 
decreases as 
) The energy carried by the electromagnetic wave
is proportional (as for any wave, Chapter 11) to the square of the amplitude,
or 
as will be discussed further in Section 22–7, so the intensity of the wave
decreases as 
Thus the energy carried by EM waves follows the inverse
square law just as for sound waves (Eqs. 11–16).
