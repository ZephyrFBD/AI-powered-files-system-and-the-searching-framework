se the amount of light and
oxygen entering the ocean. The phytoplanktons
may increase. The mobility of marine animals
increases. Biodiversity and, therefore, net
primary productivity increases. Some chemicals
and bioremediation can help oil clean up.
c.
Oil spills cover the surface of the ocean,
reducing the amount of light entering the ocean.
The marine organisms that can survive
independent of light will not be affected. Some
chemicals and bioremediation can help oil clean
up.
d.
Oil spills cover the surface of the ocean,
reducing the amount of light and oxygen
entering the ocean. The phytoplankton may
perish. Presence of oil would limit mobility of
marine animals and may result in death. Some
chemicals and bioremediation can help oil clean
up.
67. Global climate change has led to butterflies emerging
earlier and amphibians mating earlier in the United
Kingdom. What impact is it most likely to have on their
populations in the next few years?
a.
There will be no impact on butterfly an
