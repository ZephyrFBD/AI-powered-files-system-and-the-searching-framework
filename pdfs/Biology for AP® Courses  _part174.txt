 oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with
eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H2O. The electrons are
shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.

What makes ionic bonds different from covalent bonds?
a.
Ionic bond involves the transfer of electrons whereas covalent bond involves the sharing of electrons.
b.
Ionic bond involves the van der Waals force of interaction whereas covalent bond involves the sharing of
electrons.
c.
Ionic bond involves the sharing of electrons whereas a covalent bond involves the transfer of electrons.
d.
An ionic bond involves the transfer of electrons whereas a covalent bond involves the van der Waals force
of interaction.
Polar Covalent Bonds
There are two types of covalent bonds: polar a
