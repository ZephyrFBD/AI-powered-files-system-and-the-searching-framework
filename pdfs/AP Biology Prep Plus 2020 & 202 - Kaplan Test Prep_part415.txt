consumed.
Because measuring the consumption of carbon dioxide typically requires
expensive equipment and complex procedures, you will use the floating
disk procedure to measure the production of oxygen.
In this procedure, you use a vacuum to remove all air and then add a
bicarbonate solution to plant (leaf) disk samples. These leaves sink until
placed in suﬀicient light, when photosynthesis produces enough oxygen

bubbles to change the buoyancy of the disk, causing it to float to the
surface. Many diﬀerent factors can aﬀect the rate of photosynthesis in the
real world (i.e., intensity of light, color of light, leaf size, type of plant), but
the results of this experiment can also be influenced by diﬀerent
procedural factors (i.e., depth of solution, method of cutting disks, size of
leaf disks). You will eﬀectively be measuring net photosynthesis. The

disk to float to
