 force it 
 
 into my mouth and I’m so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly 
 
 sticking out a mile.

 It’s early in the morning and there’s a motor car outside our door, the 
 
 first one we’ve ever seen in the lane.There are men in suits looking in 
 
 the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something 
 
 wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane. 
 
 It’s Finn the Horse. He’s lying on the floor of the stable looking up 
 
 the lane and there’s white stuff like milk around his mouth.The stable 
 
 man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this 
 
 morning and it’s strange because he’s always up and ready for his feed. 
 
 The men are shaking their heads.My brother Michael says to one of the 
 
 men, Mister, what’s up with Finn? 
 
 Sick horse, son. Go home. 
 
 The stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on 
 
 him. He says to Michael,That horse is a goner.We have to shoot him.
