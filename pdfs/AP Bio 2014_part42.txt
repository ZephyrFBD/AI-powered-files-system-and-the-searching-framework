ts were eliminated. The treated 
termites continued to behave normally and to eat 
wood, but they began to starve after a short time. 
When the treated termites were instead fed wood 
contaminated with the feces of untreated termites, 
the treated termites regained the ability to digest 
wood and no longer starved. The best analysis of 
the results of the experiment is that 
  
(A) infection with protozoa causes the termites to 
switch to fermentation 
(B) cooperative interactions between the termites 
and the protozoa allow termites to extract 
energy from wood to survive 
(C) the termite immune system eliminates 
protozoa from the gut 
(D) termites digest protozoa as their main source 
of energy 
 
 
 
 
 4. Ethylene is an organic compound produced by 
ripening fruits. In a controlled experiment, 
researchers found that ethylene gas stimulated  
the ripening process in newly harvested fruits. 
Which of the following describes the most likely 
connection between natural ethylene produ
