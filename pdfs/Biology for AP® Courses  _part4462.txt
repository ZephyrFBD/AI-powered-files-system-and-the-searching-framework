behavior in the future, termed reciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each
other, often the result of living in the same social group, and that cheaters (those that never “give back”) are punished.
Evolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called
“altruistic behaviors” are not altruistic at all. The definition of “pure” altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that
benefits another without any direct benefit to oneself. Most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this
definition, and game theorists are good at finding “selfish” components in them. Others have argued that the terms “selfish”
and “altruistic” should b
