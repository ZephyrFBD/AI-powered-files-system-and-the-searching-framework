 14.25 (a) Consider the combustion of hydrogen, 2 H21g2 +
O21g2 ยก  2 H2O1g2. If hydrogen is burning at the rate 
of 0.48 mol>s, what is the rate of consumption of oxygen? 
What is the rate of formation of water vapor? (b) The re-
action 2 NO1g2 + Cl21g2 ยก 2 NOCl1g2 is carried out in 
a closed vessel. If the partial pressure of NO is decreasing 
at the rate of 56 torr/min, what is the rate of change of the 
total pressure of the vessel?
 14.26 (a) Consider the combustion of ethylene, C2H41g2 +
3 O21g2 ยก 2 CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2. If the concentra-
tion of C2H4 is decreasing at the rate of 0.036 M>s, 
what are the rates of change in the concentrations of 
CO2 and H2O? (b) The rate of decrease in N2H4 partial 
pressure in a closed reaction vessel from the reaction 
N2H41g2 + H21g2 ยก 2 NH31g2 is 74 torr per hour. What 
are the rates of change of NH3 partial pressure and total 
pressure in the vessel?
