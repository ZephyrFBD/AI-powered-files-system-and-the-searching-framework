be replaced. In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from the splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste
product. In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron transport chain discussed below.
The actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem,
two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI)
(Figure 8.16). The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron
supply) and what they reduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons).
Both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are
bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by the light-
harvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consist
