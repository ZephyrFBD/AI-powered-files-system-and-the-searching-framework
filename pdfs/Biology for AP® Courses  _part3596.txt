concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body.
Knowing the RQ, the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated:
alveolar PO2 = inspired PO2 − (
alveolar PO2
RQ
)
With an RQ of 0.8 and a PCO2 in the alveoli of 40 mm Hg, the alveolar PO2 is equal to:
alveolar PO2 = 150 mm Hg − (40 mm Hg
0.8
) = mm Hg.
Notice that this pressure is less than the external air. Therefore, the oxygen will flow from the inspired air in the lung ( PO2
= 150 mm Hg) into the bloodstream ( PO2 = 100 mm Hg) (Figure 30.13).
In the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Oxygen (about 98 percent)
binds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues
where oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar PO2
is higher in the alveoli ( PALVO 2 = 100 mm Hg) than blood PO2 (40 mm Hg) in the capi
