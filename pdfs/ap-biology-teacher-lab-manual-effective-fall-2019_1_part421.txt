espiration. 
•  When does it occur? Are there any situations when living cells are not respiring? 
•  Why might some living cells respire more than others? 
•  Are there differences between major groups of organisms in how fast they respire? 
•  What is the difference, if any, in the rate of cellular respiration between germinating 
seeds and nongerminating seeds? 
•  Does the temperature of germinating seeds affect the rate of cellular respiration? 
Do plant seeds consume more oxygen at higher temperatures than at lower 
temperatures? 
•  Do germinating seeds just starting to germinate consume oxygen at a greater rate 
than seeds that have been germinating for several days (age dependence)? 
•  Do seeds such as Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds (which store energy as oil) respire at a 
different rate from small grass seeds (which store energy as starch)? 
•  Do small seeds of spring flowers, weeds, or grasses respire at a different rate from 
seeds from summer, fall, or winter plants? 
•  Do
