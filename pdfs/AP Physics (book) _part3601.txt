Elementary Particles
Baryon decay. Show that the decay modes of the 
baryon
given in Table 32–2 do not violate the conservation laws we have studied up to
now: energy, charge, baryon number, lepton numbers.
APPROACH Table 32–2 shows two possible decay modes, (a)
(b) 
All the particles have lepton numbers equal to zero.
SOLUTION (a) Energy: for
the change in mass-energy is
so energy can be conserved with the resulting particles having kinetic energy.
Charge:
so
