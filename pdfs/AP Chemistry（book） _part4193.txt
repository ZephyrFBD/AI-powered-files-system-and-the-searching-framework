which is a weak acid. The conjugate base of a weak acid acts as a weak 
base, so CO3
  2- ions will increase the pH. page 702 HBrO3.  
For an oxyacid, acidity increases as the electronegativity of the 
central ion increases, which would make HBrO2 more acidic than 
HIO2. Acidity also increases as the number of oxygens bound to 
the central atom increases, which would make HBrO3 more acidic 
than HBrO2. Combining these two relationships we can order 
these acids in terms of increasing acid-dissociation constant, 
HIO2 6 HBrO2 6 HBrO3. page 703 Basic. page 704 It must have 
an empty orbital that can interact with the lone pair on a Lewis base.
