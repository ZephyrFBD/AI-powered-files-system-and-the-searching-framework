Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)
RNA is a single-stranded helix consisting of repeating nucleotides:
adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil (U), which replaces thymine. The 5-
carbon sugar in RNA is ribose.
Figure 9.3 shows structural formulas for the purines—adenine and
guanine—and for the pyrimidines—cytosine, thymine, and uracil. Notice
that purines have a double-ring structure, while pyrimidines have a single-
ring structure.

DNA REPLICATION IN EUKARYOTES
DNA replication, the making of an exact replica of the DNA molecule by
semiconservative replication, was predicted by Watson and Crick and
proven by Meselson and Stahl. The DNA double helix unzips, and each
strand serves as a template for the formation of a new strand composed of
complementary nucleotides: A with T and C with G. The two new
molecules each consist of one old strand and one new strand. The
following describes
