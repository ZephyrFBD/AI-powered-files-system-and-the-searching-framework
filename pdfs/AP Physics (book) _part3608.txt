but did not decay at a fast rate characteristic of the strong interaction (even
though they decayed into strongly interacting particles).
To explain these observations, a new quantum number, strangeness, and a
new conservation law, conservation of strangeness, were introduced. By assigning
the strangeness numbers (S) indicated in Table 32–2, the production of strange
particles in pairs was explained. Antiparticles were assigned opposite strange-
ness from their particles. For example, in the reaction
the initial state has strangeness 
and the final state has
so strangeness is conserved. But for
the
initial state has 
and the final state has 
so strangeness
would not be conserved; and this reaction is not observed.
To explain the decay of strange particles, it is assumed that strangeness is
conserved in the strong interaction but is not conserved in the wea
