▲ Figure 8.11 Charge separation in the hydrogen halides. In HF
, the strongly electronegative F pulls 
much of the electron density away from H. In HI, the I, being much less electronegative than F
, does 
not attract the shared electrons as strongly, and, consequently, there is far less polarization of the bond.
Go Figure
As you go from HF to HI, does the H—X bond become more  
or less polar?
* There are some exceptions to this statement, such as network solids, including diamond, 
 
silicon, and germanium, where an extended structure is formed even though the bonding is 
clearly covalent. These substances are discussed in Section 12.7.

8.5 ∣ Drawing Lewis Structures
Lewis structures can help us understand the bonding in many compounds and are fre-
quently used when discussing the properties of molecules. For this reason, drawing Lewi
