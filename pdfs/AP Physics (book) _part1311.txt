Interference in Space
We saw in Section 11–11 that when two waves simultaneously pass through the
same region of space, they interfere with one another. Interference also occurs
with sound waves.
Consider two large loudspeakers, A and B, a distance d apart on the stage of
an auditorium as shown in Fig. 12–16. Let us assume the two speakers are emit-
ting sound waves of the same single frequency and that they are in phase: that is,
when one speaker is forming a compression, so is the other. (We ignore reflections
from walls, floor, etc.) The curved lines in the diagram represent the crests of
sound waves from each speaker at one instant in time. We must remember that
for a sound wave, a crest is a compression in the air whereas a trough—which
falls between two crests—is a rarefaction. A human ear or detector at a poi
