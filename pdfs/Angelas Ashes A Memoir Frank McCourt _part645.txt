ways closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of 
 
 the passage, 
 
  
  
 Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, 
 
 The love he bore to learning was in fault. 
 
 The village all declared how much he knew. 
 
 ’Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. 
 
 Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, 
 
 And even the story ran that he could gauge. 
 
 In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, 
 
 For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, 
 
 While words of learned length and thundering sound 
 
 Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around. 
 
 And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, 
 
 That one small head could carry all he knew. 
 
 We know he loves these lines because they’re about a schoolmaster, 
 
 about him, and he’s right because we wonder how one small head could 
 
 carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, 
 
 Ah, boys, boys,You can make up your own minds but first stock them. 
 
 Are you listening to me?
