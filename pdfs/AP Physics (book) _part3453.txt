y large for a self-sustaining chain reaction to take place.
The minimum mass of uranium needed is called the critical mass. The value of
the critical mass depends on the moderator, the fuel (
may be used instead
of 
), and how much the fuel is enriched, if at all. Typical values are on the
order of a few kilograms (that is, neither grams nor thousands of kilograms).
Critical mass depends also on the average number of neutrons released per
fission: 2.5 for 
2.9 for 
so the critical mass for 
is smaller.
To have a self-sustaining chain reaction, on average at least one neutron
produced in each fission must go on to produce another fission. The average
number of neutrons per fission that do go on to produce further fissions is 
called the neutron multiplication factor, f. For a self-sustaining chain reaction,
we must have
