Scientists normally do their research as if the accepted laws and theories
were true. But they are obliged to keep an open mind in case new information
should alter the validity of any given law or theory.
1–4 Measurement and Uncertainty;
Significant Figures
In the quest to understand the world around us, scientists seek to find relation-
ships among physical quantities that can be measured.
Uncertainty
Reliable measurements are an important part of physics. But no measurement is
absolutely precise. There is an uncertainty associated with every measurement.

Among the most important sources of uncertainty, other than blunders, are the
limited accuracy of every measuring instrument and the inability to read an
instrument beyond some fraction of the smallest division shown. For example,
if you were to use a centimeter ruler to measure the width of a board (Fig. 1–5),
the result could be claimed to be precise
