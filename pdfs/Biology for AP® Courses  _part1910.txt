ommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death
from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer
treatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result
in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think?
Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be
screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?
a.
In general, all men should be screened as it is necessary to take the risk.
b.
In general, all men should be given treatment irrespective of the presence or absence of cancer symptoms.
c.
In general, only men suspecting cancer should be screened.
d.
There is no requirement of any screening, as cancer shows no problems.
