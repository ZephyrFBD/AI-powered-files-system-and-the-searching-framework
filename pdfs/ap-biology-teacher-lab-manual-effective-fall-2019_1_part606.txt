“fingerprint” that is unique to each organism. The unique fragments, called restriction 
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), can, for instance, be used to confirm that a 
mutation is present in one fragment of DNA but not in another, to determine the size of 
an unknown DNA fragment that was inserted into a plasmid, to compare the genomes 
of different species and determine evolutionary relationships, and to compare DNA

samples from different individuals within a population. This latter application is widely 
used in crime scene investigations. 
Consider your classmates. More than 99% of your DNA is the same as their DNA. 
The small difference is attributed to differences in your genetic makeup, with each 
person having a genetic profile or “fingerprint” as unique as the ridges, arches, loops, 
and grooves at the ends of his or her fingers.
