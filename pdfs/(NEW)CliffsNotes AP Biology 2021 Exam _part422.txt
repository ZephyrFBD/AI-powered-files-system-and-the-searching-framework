occurs in plants (and occasionally animals) where triploid (3n), tetraploid (4n), and higher ploidy
chromosome numbers are found. Polyploidy occurs as a result of nondisjunction of all chromosomes during meiosis,
producing two viable diploid gametes and two sterile gametes with no chromosomes. A tetraploid zygote can be
established when a diploid sperm fertilizes a diploid egg. Since normal meiosis in the tetraploid individual will
continue to produce diploid gametes, reproductive isolation with other individuals in the population (and thus
speciation) occurs immediately in a single generation.
Hybridization occurs when two distinctly different forms of a species (or closely related species that are normally
reproductively isolated) mate and produce progeny along a geographic boundary called a hybrid zone. In some
cases, the genetic variation of the hybrids is greater than that of either parent and permits the population of hybrids
to evolve adaptations to environmental conditions in t
