genous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain
carbon and nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra
hydrogen, thus decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. Each nucleotide in
DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).
Adenine and guanine are classified as purines. The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings. Cytosine,
thymine, and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure
(Figure 3.33). Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. In molecular biology
shorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C
whereas RNA contains A, U, G, and C.
