ntral carbon atom, also known as the alpha (Î±) carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH2), a carboxyl group (COOH),
and to a hydrogen atom. Every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as
the R group (Figure 3.24).
Figure 3.24 Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen
atom, and a side chain (R group) are attached.
The name "amino acid" is derived from the fact that they contain both amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic
structure. As mentioned, there are 20 common amino acids present in proteins. Nine of these are considered essential amino
acids in humans because the human body cannot produce them and they are obtained from the diet. For each amino acid,
the R group (or side chain) is different (Figure 3.25).
