approach correctly predicts the bonding in SnCl4 to be polar covalent based on an elec-
tronegativity difference of 1.2 and at the same time correctly predicts the bonding in 
NaCl to be predominantly ionic based on an electronegativity difference of 2.1.
Evaluating bonding based on electronegativity difference is a useful system, but it 
has one shortcoming. The electronegativity values given in Figure 8.8 do not take into 
account changes in bonding that accompany changes in the oxidation state of the 
metal. For example, Figure 8.8 gives the electronegativity difference between manganese 
and oxygen as 3.5 - 1.5 = 2.0, which falls in the range where the bonding is normally 
considered ionic (the electronegativity difference for NaCl is 3.0 - 0.9 = 2.1). Therefore, 
it is not surprising to learn that manganese(II) oxide, MnO, is a green solid that melts at 
1842 Â°C and has the same crystal structure as NaCl.
However, the bonding between manganese and oxygen is not always ionic. M
