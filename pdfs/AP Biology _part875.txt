tion would be inhibited
and the rate of the reaction would decrease until the reaction
ceased totally. Refer to the following graph:

I made this prediction because each enzyme functions in the
way that it does because of its unique shape or conformation.
The rate of an enzyme reaction is optimal within a narrow range
of temperatures. Outside that narrow range, the intramolecular
bonds that hold an enzyme in its specific conformation break,
causing the enzyme to lose its special shape. Enzymes denature
at high temperatures, and, when they do, the reaction is
inhibited.
ANALYSIS OF SAMPLE ANSWER
General Guidelines
The numbers in the margins of the sample answer represent points of merit
in each part of the answer. Although the student may have presented many
correct statements in each part of his or her responses, remember that it is
only possible to earn the maximum number of points that are stated for
each part of the question. For example
