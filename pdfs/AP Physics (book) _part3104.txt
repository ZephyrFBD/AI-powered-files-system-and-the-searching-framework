of 4.8 MeV. How close could they get to the surface of a 
gold nucleus 
Ignore the recoil motion of the nucleus.
78. By what fraction does the mass of an H atom decrease
when it makes an 
to
transition?
79. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational force to the electric
force for the electron in the ground state of a hydrogen
atom. Can the gravitational force be reasonably ignored?
80. Electrons accelerated from rest by a potential difference
of 12.3 V pass through a gas of hydrogen atoms at room
temperature. What wavelengths of light will be emitted?
81. In a particular photoelectric experiment, a stopping
potential of 2.10 V is measured when ultraviolet light of
wavelength 270 nm is incident on the metal. Using the
same setup, what will the new stopping potential be if blue
light of wavelength 440 nm is used, instead?
82. Neutrons can be used in diffraction experiments to probe
the lattice structure of crystalline solids. Since the neutronâ€™s
wavelength needs to be on the ord
