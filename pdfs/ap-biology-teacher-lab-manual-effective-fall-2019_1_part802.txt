is enzyme. Peroxidase is one of several enzymes 
that break down peroxide, a toxic metabolic waste product of aerobic respiration. Using 
peroxidase, you will develop essential skills to examine your own questions about 
enzyme function. 
Later, you will have an opportunity to select an enzyme, research its properties 
and mode of reaction, and then design an experiment to explore its function. The 
investigation also provides an opportunity for you to apply and review concepts you 
have studied previously, including the levels of protein structure, energy transfer, abiotic 
and biotic influences on molecular structure, entropy and enthalpy, and the role of 
enzymes in maintaining homeostasis. 
■ Learning Objectives 
•  ENE-1.F: Explain how changes to the structure of an enzyme may affect its function. 
•  ENE-1.G: Explain how the cellular environment affects enzyme activity. 
•  SYI-3.A: Explain the connection between variation in the number and types of 
molecules within cells to the
