forestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of
forests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide. Methane (CH4) is produced when bacteria break down organic
matter under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in
rice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores. Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition
that occurs in landfills. Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates. Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and
methane found at the bottom of the ocean. When water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is released. As the
oceanâ€™s water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more methane. This leads
to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming. This is an example
of the positive feedback loop that is leading to
