ts designed to measure temperature are called thermometers.
There are many kinds of thermometers, but their operation always depends on
some property of matter that changes with temperature. Many common thermom-
eters rely on the expansion of a material with an increase in temperature. The first
idea for a thermometer, by Galileo, made use of the expansion of a gas. Common
thermometers today consist of a hollow glass tube filled with mercury or with alco-
hol colored with a red dye, as were the earliest usable thermometers (Fig. 13–4).
Inside a common liquid-in-glass thermometer, the liquid expands more than
the glass when the temperature is increased, so the liquid level rises in the tube
(Fig. 13–5a). Although metals also expand with temperature, the change in length
of a metal rod, say, is generally too small to measure accurately for ordinary changes
in temperature. However, a useful thermometer can be made by bonding together
two different metals with different rates of expansion
