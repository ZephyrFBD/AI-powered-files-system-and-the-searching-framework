 orbitals among the subsequent mem-
bers of the series.
After the lanthanide series, the third transition element series is completed by the 
filling of the 5d orbitals, followed by the filling of the 6p orbitals. This brings us to radon 
(Rn), the heaviest naturally occurring noble-gas element.
The final row of the periodic table begins by filling the 7s orbitals. The actinide 
elements, of which uranium (U, element 92) and plutonium (Pu, element 94) are the 
best known, are then built up by completing the 5f orbitals. All of the actinide elements 
are radioactive, and most of them are not found in nature.

Electron Configurations and  
the Periodic Table
We just saw that the electron configurations of the elements correspond to their loca-
tions in the periodic table. Thus, elements in the same column of the table have related 
outer-shell (valence) electron configurations. As Table 6.4 shows, for example, all 2A ele-
ments have an ns2 outer configuration, and all 3A elements
