possible to shift the luminescence so 
that the emitted photons are in the visible region of the spectrum 
by making appropriately sized nanocrystals?
Quantum dots are being explored for applications ranging from 
electronics to lasers to medical imaging because they are very bright, 
very stable, and small enough to be taken up by living cells even after 
being coated with a biocompatible surface layer.
Semiconductors do not have to be shrunk to the nanoscale in all 
three dimensions to show new properties. They can be laid down in 
relatively large two-dimensional areas on a substrate but be only a few 
nanometers thick to make quantum wells. Quantum wires, in which the 
semiconductor wire diameter is only a few nanometers but its length 
is very long, have also been made by various chemical routes. In both 
quantum wells and quantum wires, measurements along the nanoscale 
dimension(s) show quantum behavior, but in the long dimension, the 
properties seem to be just like those of th
