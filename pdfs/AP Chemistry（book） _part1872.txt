Intermetallic compounds play many important roles in modern society. The 
intermetallic compound Ni3Al is a major component of jet aircraft engines because of 
its strength at high temperature and its low density. Razor blades are often coated with 
Cr3Pt, which adds hardness, allowing the blade to stay sharp longer. Both compounds 
have the structure shown on the left-hand side of Figure 12.17. The compound Nb3Sn, 
also shown in Figure 12.17, is a superconductor, a substance that, when cooled below a 
critical temperature, conducts electricity with no resistance. In the case of Nb3Sn super-
conductivity is observed only when the temperature falls below 18 K. Superconductors 
are used in the magnets in MRI scanners widely employed for medical imaging. 
 (Sec-
tion 6.7, “Nuclear Spin and Magnetic Resonance Imaging”) The need to keep the mag-
nets cooled to such a low temperature is part of the reason why MRI devices are expens
