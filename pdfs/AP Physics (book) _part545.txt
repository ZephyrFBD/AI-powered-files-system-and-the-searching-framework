f his arms are capable of 
exerting a force of 1150 N on
the vine, what is the maximum
speed he can tolerate at the
lowest point of his swing? His
mass is 78 kg and the vine is
4.7 m long.
20. (II) Highway curves are marked with a suggested speed. If this
speed is based on what would be safe in wet weather, estimate
the radius of curvature for an unbanked curve marked
Use Table 4–2 (coefficients of friction).
21. (III) A pilot performs an evasive maneuver by diving verti-
cally at 
If he can withstand an acceleration of
8.0 g’s without blacking out, at what altitude must he begin
to pull his plane out of the dive to avoid crashing into the sea?
22. (III) If a curve with a radius of 95 m is properly banked 
for a car traveling 
what must be the coefficient of
static friction for a car not to skid when traveling at 
23. (III) A curve of radius 78 m is banked for a design speed 
of 
If the coefficient of static friction is 0.30 (wet
pavement), at what range of speeds can a car safely make
