monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal. Termites are also able to break down cellulose because of the
presence of other organisms in their bodies that secrete cellulases.
Carbohydrates serve various functions in different animals. Arthropods (insects, crustaceans, and others) have an outer
skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts (as seen in the bee in Figure 3.12). This
exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin, which is a polysaccharide-containing nitrogen. It is made of
repeating units of N-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosamine, a modified sugar. Chitin is also a major component of fungal cell walls; fungi
are neither animals nor plants and form a kingdom of their own in the domain Eukarya.
