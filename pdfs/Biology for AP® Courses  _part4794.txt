e. DNA barcoding is one molecular genetic method, which takes
advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene present in eukaryotes, excepting the plants, to identify species
using the sequence of portions of the gene. Plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes. Rapid
mass sequencing machines make the molecular genetics portion of the work relatively inexpensive and quick. Computer
resources store and make available the large volumes of data. Projects are currently underway to use DNA barcoding to
catalog museum specimens, which have already been named and studied, as well as testing the method on less studied
groups. As of mid 2012, close to 150,000 named species had been barcoded. Early studies suggest there are significant
numbers of undescribed species that looked too much like sibling species to previously be recognized as different. These
now can be identified with DNA barcoding.
Numerous computer databases now provide information about named species and
