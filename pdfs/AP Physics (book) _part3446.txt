he two ends via the short-range nuclear force is greatly weakened by the
increased separation distance. Then the electric repulsive force becomes dominant,
and the nucleus splits in two (Fig. 31–3d). The two resulting nuclei,
and 
are called fission fragments, and in the process a number of neutrons (typically
two or three) are also given off. The reaction can be written
(31;3)
The compound nucleus,
exists for less than 
so the process occurs
very quickly. The two fission fragments,
and 
rarely split the original
uranium mass precisely half and half, but more often as about 40%–60%. A typical
fission reaction is

although many others also occur.
Counting nucleons. Identify the element X
in the fission reaction
RESPONSE The number of nucleons is conserved (Section 30–7). The uranium
nucleus with 235 nucleons plus the incoming neutron make 
nucleons. So there must be 236 nucleons after the reaction. The Sr has 93 nucleons,
and the two neutrons make 95 nucleons, so X has
