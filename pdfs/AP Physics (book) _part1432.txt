n the walls of its container is,
according to our model, due to the collisions of the molecules with the walls. Let
us focus our attention on the wall, of area A, at the left end of the container and
examine what happens when one molecule strikes this wall, as shown in Fig.13–18b.
This molecule exerts a force on the wall, and according to Newton’s third law 
the wall exerts an equal and opposite force back on the molecule. The magnitude 
of this force on the molecule, according to Newton’s second law, is equal to the
molecule’s rate of change of momentum,
(Eq. 7–2). Assuming
the collision is elastic, only the x component of the molecule’s momentum changes,
and it changes from 
(it is moving in the negative x direction) to 
Thus
the change in the molecule’s momentum,
which is the final momentum
minus the initial momentum, is
for one collision. This molecule will make many collisions with the wall, each
separated by a time 
which is the time it takes the molecule to travel across 
the co
