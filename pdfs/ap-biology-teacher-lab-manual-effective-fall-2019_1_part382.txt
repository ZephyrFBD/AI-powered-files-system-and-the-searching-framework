ters that match the 
organism(s) being tested. Having various sizes or syringes available also mitigates the 
problem of seeds getting stuck after germinating. Larger syringes can be disassembled, 
cleaned, and reused. Students can then compare species — plants versus animals, 
annelids versus arthropods, slow versus fast moving, flying versus not flying, etc. 
Students also can examine the effects of different temperatures or light levels on 
respiration rates. Table 1 indicates appropriate syringe sizes for various organisms.
