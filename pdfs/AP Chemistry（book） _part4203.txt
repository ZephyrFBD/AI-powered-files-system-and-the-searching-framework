Figure 2.3 Cathode rays would still be generated but without  
the fluorescent screen you would not be able to see them.  
Figure 2.4 The electron beam would be deflected downward 
because of repulsion by the upper negative plate and attraction 
toward the positive plate. Figure 2.5 No, the electrons are of 
negligible mass compared with an oil drop. Figure 2.7 Beta rays 
are equivalent to electrons. (a) They are lighter. Figure 2.9 The 
beam consists of alpha particles, which carry a +2 charge. They are 
repelled from the positively charged gold nuclei. Figure 2.10 10-2 
pm Figure 2.13 Based on the periodic trend, we expect that ele-
ments that precede a nonreactive gas, as F does, will also be reactive 
nonmetals. The elements fitting this pattern are H and Cl.  
Figure 2.16 All of the metals shown here are solids, that exhibit 
varying degrees of luster to their appearance. In contrast, bromine is 
a liquid and none of the nonmetals shown her
