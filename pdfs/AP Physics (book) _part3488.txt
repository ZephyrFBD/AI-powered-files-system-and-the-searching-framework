ical damage produced by radiation because equal doses of
different types of radiation cause differing amounts of damage. For example,
1 rad of 
radiation does 10 to 20 times the amount of damage as 1 rad of 
or 
rays. This difference arises largely because 
rays (and other heavy particles
such as protons and neutrons) move much more slowly than and rays of equal
energy due to their greater mass. Hence, ionizing collisions occur closer together,
