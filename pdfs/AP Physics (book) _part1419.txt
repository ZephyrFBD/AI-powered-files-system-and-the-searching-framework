d the universal gas constant because its value is found experimentally to
be the same for all gases. The value of R, in several sets of units (only the first is
the proper SI unit), is
[SI units]
†
Equation 13–3 is called the ideal gas law, or the equation of state for an ideal gas.
We use the term “ideal” because real gases do not follow Eq. 13–3 precisely, par-
ticularly at high pressure (and density) or when the gas is near the liquefaction point
However, at pressures less than an atmosphere or so, and when
T is not close to the liquefaction point of the gas, Eq. 13–3 is quite accurate and
useful for real gases.
Always remember, when using the ideal gas law, that temperatures must be
given in kelvins (K) and that the pressure P must always be absolute pressure, not
gauge pressure (Section 10–4).
