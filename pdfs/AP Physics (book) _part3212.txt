(a) What
is the wavelength of this bullet? (b) If the position of the
bullet is known to a precision of 0.60 cm (radius of the
barrel), what is the minimum uncertainty in its momentum?
49. If an electron’s position can be measured to a precision of
what is the uncertainty in its momentum?
Assuming its momentum must be at least equal to its
uncertainty, estimate the electron’s wavelength.
50. The ionization (binding) energy of the outermost electron
in boron is 8.26 eV. (a) Use the Bohr model to estimate the
“effective charge,”
seen by this electron. (b) Estimate
the average orbital radius.

51. Using the Bohr formula for the radius of an electron orbit,
estimate the average distance from the nucleus for an
electron in the innermost 
orbit of a uranium atom
Approximately how much energy would be
required to remove
