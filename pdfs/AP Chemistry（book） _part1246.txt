What would happen to the 
concentration of electron density 
between the nuclei in (b) if you pulled 
the nuclei further apart?
Give It Some Thought
Ionizing an H2 molecule to H2
+ changes the strength of the bond. Based on the 
description of covalent bonding given previously, do you expect the H¬H bond in 
H2
+ to be weaker or stronger than the H  ¬   
H bond in H2?
Lewis Structures
The formation of covalent bonds can be represented with Lewis symbols. The formation 
of the H2 molecule from two H atoms, for example, can be represented as
H

H H

In forming the covalent bond, each hydrogen atom acquires a second electron, achiev-
ing the stable, two-electron, noble-gas electron configuration of helium.
Formation of a covalent bond between two Cl atoms to give a Cl2 molecule can be 
represented in a similar way:
Cl +
Cl
Cl
