er lakes that act to move the
nutrients and oxygen at the bottom of deep lakes to the top. Turnover occurs because water has a maximum
density at 4 Â°C. Surface water temperature changes as the seasons progress, and denser water sinks.
The spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move nutrients and water from the
bottom to the top. Explain how this is different in temperate regions as compared to the tropics.
a.
Spring turnover occurs in tropical lakes, but not in temperate lakes. Stratification occurs in temperate lakes.
b.
Temperate lakes do not freeze so they do not undergo spring turnover or stratification.
c.
Stratification and spring turnover occur in tropical lakes. Temperate lakes do not freeze so they do not
undergo spring turnover.
d.
Stratification and spring turnover occur in temperate lakes. Tropical lakes do not freeze so they do not
undergo spring turnover.
In springtime, air temperatures increase and surface ice melts. When the te
