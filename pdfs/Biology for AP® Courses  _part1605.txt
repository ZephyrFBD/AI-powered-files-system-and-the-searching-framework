4.
bacteriophages from a bacterial culture grown in
a nutrient-containing medium and radioactively
labeled using a sulfur isotope did not transfer the
label to bacteria incubated in an unlabeled
nutrient-containing medium
C. Transformation and transduction increase variation
within populations of bacteria and archaebacteria by the
following:
a.
transferring DNA among different species
b.
transferring free DNA across the cell membrane
without energy expenditure
c.
transferring DNA between different strains of
the same species of bacteria
d.
phagocytosis of bacteriophages
The evolution of antibiotic resistance via HGT poses a
challenge to medical technology. On the other hand,
transformation is often assayed by incorporating an
antibiotic-resistance gene in the plasmid to be transferred
into the host organism. In natural environments, bacterial
and archaebacter
