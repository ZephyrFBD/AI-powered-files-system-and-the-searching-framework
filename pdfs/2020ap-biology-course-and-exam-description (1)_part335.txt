Describe any significant change in the susceptibility of mosquitoes from region B to each of the two 
insecticides over the two-year period.
•	 For permethrin, there was little significant change in susceptibility until the June 2010 test, when the 
mosquitoes were significantly less susceptible than they had been for the previous three tests. For 
deltamethrin, there was a significant decrease in susceptibility from June 2009 to October 2009 and 
then a further significant decrease from October 2009 to June 2010.
