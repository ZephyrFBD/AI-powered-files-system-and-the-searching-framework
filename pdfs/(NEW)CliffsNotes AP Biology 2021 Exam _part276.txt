dy, called
a Barr body. Barr bodies are mostly inactive X chromosomesâ€”most of the genes are not expressed nor do they
interact (in a dominant/recessive or codominant manner) with their respective alleles on the X chromosome that is
expressed. Thus, only the alleles of the genes on the one active X chromosome are expressed by that cell. When
Xinactivation begins, one of the two chromosomes in each embryonic cell randomly and independently becomes
inactive. Subsequent daughter cells will have the same X chromosome inactivated as did the embryonic parent cell
from which they originated. In the fully developed fetus, then, some groups of cells will have one X chromosome
inactivated, while other groups will have the other X chromosome inactivated. Thus, all of the cells in a female
mammal are not functionally identical.
A very visible example of X-inactivation can be seen in the different groups of cells producing different patches of
color in an individual calico cat. Calico cats have oran
