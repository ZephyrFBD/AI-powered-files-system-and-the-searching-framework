he new species can be explained by the allopatric model of speciation. A
new species arises in a different place and expands its range, outcompeting
and replacing the ancestral species. See Figure 11.6, which illustrates
gradualism and punctuated equilibrium.

EVO-DEVO
How is it that humans and chimps are so different when our DNA is
almost identical? (We share 98.9% of our DNA sequence.) We are bipedal
(walk upright) and can send rockets to the moon, while chimps still walk
on four legs in the rainforest. We donâ€™t know all the answers. However,

the field of evo-devo, evolutionary developmental biology, provides some
answers. In essence, major changes in body form and function can come
about when some genes regulate other genes.
Certain Genes Alter Other Genes to Influence Development
The DNA sequence that codes for a particular structure might be identical
in different species. However, these
