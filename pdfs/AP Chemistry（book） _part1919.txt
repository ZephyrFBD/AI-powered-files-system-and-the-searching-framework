An external voltage pushes 
electrons from the n-type 
side and holes from the 
p-type side into the junction.
Electrons fall into the empty 
holes, and photons are 
emitted with energy equal 
to the band gap.

applied voltage drives electrons and holes together, where they combine and give off light.
Artificial lighting is so widespread we take it for granted. Major sav-
ings in energy would be realized if incandescent lights could be re-
placed by light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Because LEDs are made from 
semiconductors, this is an appropriate place to take a closer look at 
the operation of an LED.
The heart of an LED is a p–n diode, which is formed by bringing 
an n-type s
