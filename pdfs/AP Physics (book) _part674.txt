 must
the pump motor have?
68. (II) A ski area claims that its lifts can move 47,000 people
per hour. If the average lift carries people about 200 m (ver-
tically) higher, estimate the maximum total power needed.
69. (II) A 65-kg skier grips a moving rope that is powered by
an engine and is pulled at constant speed to the top of a 23°
hill. The skier is pulled a distance
along the
incline and it takes 2.0 min to reach the top of the hill. If
the coefficient of kinetic friction between the snow and skis
is  
what horsepower engine is required if 30 such
skiers (max) are on the rope at one time?
70. (II) What minimum horsepower must a motor have to be
able to drag a 370-kg box along a level floor at a speed of
if the coefficient of friction is 0.45?
71. (III) A bicyclist coasts down a 6.0° hill at a steady speed 
of 
Assuming a total mass of 75 kg (bicycle plus
rider), what must be the cyclist’s power output to climb the
same hill at the same speed?
