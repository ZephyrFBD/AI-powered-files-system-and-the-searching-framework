cycle. 
(B) Gas is fixed by plants as part of the 
nitrogen cycle. 
(C) Gas is directly obtained by plants as part of

32. Which of the following best explains how the 
phospholipid bilayer of a transport vesicle 
contributes to cellular functions? 
(A) The phospholipid bilayer allows the vesicle 
to fuse with the Golgi apparatus and the 
plasma membrane, allowing the 
exocytosis of proteins. 
(B) The phospholipid bilayer physically 
connects the nuclear 
 to the 
rough endoplasmic reticulum, thus 
increasing the rate of transcription and 
translation. 
(C) The phospholipid bilayer of a transport 
vesicle contains chemicals that digest the 
proteins made in the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum. 
(D) The phospholipid bilayer contains enzymes 
that catalyze the conversion of hydrogen 
peroxide to water and oxygen.
