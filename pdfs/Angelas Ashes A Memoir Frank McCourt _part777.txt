 look and tells the boys,Ye are not to be looking at those dirty

 Eamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an 
 
 American magazine, Collier’s, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. 
 
 Eamon says,Do you know what he’s doing in there? At himself.Five 
 
 times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in 
 
 with the women’s underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. 
 
 Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and 
 
 God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he 
 
 fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide. 
 
 I’d like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I 
 
 don’t want them saying,There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, 
 
 already at himself.Won’t light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an 
 
  
  
 oul’ billygoat.
