r each possible
combination of traits is calculated by multiplying the probability for each individual trait. Thus, the probability of F2
offspring having yellow, round, and tall traits is 3 × 3 × 3, or 27.
Probability Method
While the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method
gives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance.
Both methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately. Earlier, we examined the
phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to
examine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes.
For a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method.
To fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genet
