It is recommended that you use a computer projector to demonstrate the steps of the 
procedure and work through the first gene sequence with the entire class after you work 
through the steps yourself. After modeling the analysis of the first gene, the students 
should then continue the lab in groups. 
Screenshots of each step in the procedure are provided in the Student Manual version 
of this lab. In addition to the screenshots, the following video tutorials may be helpful. 
However, please note that these tutorials do not match the exact procedures of this lab.
