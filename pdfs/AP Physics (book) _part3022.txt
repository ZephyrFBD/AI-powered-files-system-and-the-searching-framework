FIGURE 27–9 The Compton effect.
A single photon of wavelength 
strikes an electron in some material,
knocking it out of its atom. The
scattered photon has less energy
(some energy is given to the
electron) and hence has a longer
wavelength 
(shown exaggerated).
Experiments found scattered X-rays
of just the wavelengths predicted by
conservation of energy and
momentum using the photon model.

27–6 Photon Interactions; Pair Production
When a photon passes through matter, it interacts with the atoms and electrons.
There are four important types of interactions that a photon can undergo:
1. The photoelectric effect: A photon may knock an electron out of an atom and
in the process the photon disappears.
2. The photon may knock an atomic electron
