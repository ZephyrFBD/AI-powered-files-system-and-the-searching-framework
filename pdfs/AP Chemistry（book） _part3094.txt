▲ Figure 19.16 Schematic representation of free-energy changes during cell metabolism. The oxidation of 
glucose to CO2 and H2O produces free energy that is then used to convert ADP into the more energetic 
ATP. The ATP is then used, as needed, as an energy source to drive nonspontaneous reactions, such as 
the conversion of simple molecules into more complex cell constituents.

CHAPTER 19 Chemical Thermodynamics
Consider the simple salts NaCl(s) and AgCl(s). We will examine the equilibria in which these salts dissolve in water to form 
aqueous solutions of ions:
NaCl1s2 ∆Na+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2
AgCl1s2 ∆Ag+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2
(a) Calculate the value of ∆G° at 298 K for each of the preceding reactions. (b) The two values from part (a) are very different. 
Is this difference primarily due to the enthalpy term or the entropy term of the standard free-energy change? (c) Use the values
