Question 2: Interpreting and Evaluating Experimental Results  
with Graphing 
9 points 
Elevated levels of 
2
CO  increase the rate of photosynthesis and growth in plants. Scientists studying the 
mechanisms involved in these increases examined a variety of species and found that when plants are 
exposed to elevated levels of 
2
CO , there is an increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell. To investigate 
whether the elevated levels of 
2
CO  have a similar effect on the number of mitochondria in plant cells, the 
scientists then selected six of these species to quantify the number of mitochondria per cell when the plants 
were exposed to both normal and elevated levels of 
2
CO  (Table 1).
