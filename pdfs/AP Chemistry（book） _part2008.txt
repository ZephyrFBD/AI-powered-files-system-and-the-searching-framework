s the diamond structure. A classmate 
of yours tells you that density is the reason aluminum is 
a metal but silicon is not; therefore, if you were to put sili-
con under high pressure, it too would act like a metal. Dis-
cuss this idea with your classmates, looking up data about 
Al and Si as needed.

Silicon carbide, SiC, has the three-dimensional structure 
shown in the figure.

Pure iron crystallizes in a body-centered cubic structure, 
but small amounts of impurities can stabilize a face- 
centered cubic structure. Which form of iron has a higher 
density?

Introduction of carbon into a metallic lattice generally re-
sults in a harder, less ductile substance with lower electrical 
and thermal conductivities. Explain why this might be so.

Ni3Al is used in the turbines of aircraft engines because 
of its strength and low density. Nickel metal has a cubic 
close-packed structure with a face-centered cubic unit cell, 
while Ni3Al has the ordered
