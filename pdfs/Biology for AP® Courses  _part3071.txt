Electrical Synapse
While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play
important and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical
synapses. In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually
physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell
to the next. In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap
junction pores.
There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. Because chemical s
