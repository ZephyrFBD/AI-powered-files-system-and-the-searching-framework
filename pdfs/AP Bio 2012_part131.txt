rption of a mineral is not part of a signal 
transduction pathway.
(B)
This option is correct. The student is asked to justify the claim that changes in 
signal transduction pathways can alter cellular response. Second messengers 
are involved in signal transduction pathways, and if the second messenger is 
not present, the pathway is blocked.
(C)
This option is incorrect. A mutagen would cause a change in the DNA, not the 
signal transduction pathway.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Transcription of ribosomal RNA is not part of a signal 
transduction pathway.

2.E.1: Timing and coordination of specific events are 
necessary for the normal development of an organism, 
and these events are regulated by a variety of mechanisms.

to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively  
and quantitatively.
