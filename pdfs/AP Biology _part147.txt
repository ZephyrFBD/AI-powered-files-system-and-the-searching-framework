 cyclin-Cdk complex. Notice that the peaks
of MPF activity correspond to a rise in cyclin concentration. The cyclin
levels rise during the S and G2 phases and then fall abruptly during the M
phase. MPF triggers the cell’s passage past the G2 checkpoint into the M
phase.

the Cell Cycle
Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF)
PDGF is an external signal that drives the cell cycle. Specialized cells
called fibroblasts have PDGF receptors on their surface membrane. When
PDGF binds to a receptor, it triggers a signal transduction pathway that
allows cells to pass the G1 checkpoint and divide. When an injury occurs
in the body, platelets release PDGF near the injury, and a massive
proliferation (cell division) of fibroblasts heals the wound.
