24. Why are mesocosm and microcosm experiments not
considered to represent the true nature of ecosystems?
a.
The ecosystem is either recreated or partitioned

aiming to analyze.
b.
In both the experiments, dynamics of the
ecosystem may get altered due to differences in
species numbers and diversity although there are
no alterations in the environment.
c.
In both the experiment
