 of RNA in retroviruses. This DNA
copy can then insert itself into the genome of the host cell. Reverse transcriptase has a higher error rate than
DNA polymerase, which results in more mutations in the DNA copy of the RNA. Reverse transcriptase is not
typically used by eukaryotic cells for any function.
(a) Describe which nucleotides you would expect to find in the genome of a virus that uses reverse
transcriptase.
(b) The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contains RNA as its genetic material. Reverse transcriptase
inhibitors have been shown to be effective in slowing the replication of HIV. Explain why reverse
transcriptase inhibitors have few side effects in eukaryotic cells.
(c) Predict the rate of mutation in a retrovirus compared to that of a DNA virus.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. An experiment is conducted to study the effect of a ligase inhibitor on DNA replication.
(a) Describe the function of ligase in DNA replication.
(b) Identify an appropriate control fo
