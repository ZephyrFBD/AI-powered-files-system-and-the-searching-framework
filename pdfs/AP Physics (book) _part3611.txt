In 1963, M. Gell-Mann and G. Zweig proposed that none of the hadrons, not
even the proton and neutron, are truly fundamental, but instead are made up of
combinations of three more fundamental pointlike entities called (somewhat
whimsically) quarks.† Today, the quark theory is well-accepted, and quarks are
considered truly fundamental particles, like leptons. The three quarks originally
proposed were named up, down, and strange, with abbreviations u, d, s. The
theory today has six quarks, just as there are six leptons—based on a presumed
symmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top (c, b, t).
The names apply also to new properties of each quark (quantum
