u may wonder why an
unstable nucleus doesn’t fall apart immediately. In other words, why do 
nuclei 
and other isotopes have such long half-lives? Why
don’t parent nuclei all decay at once?
The answer has to do with quantum theory and the nature of the forces
involved. One way to view the situation is with the aid of a potential-energy
diagram, as in Fig. 30–12. Let us consider the particular case of the decay
The blue line represents the potential energy, including
rest mass, where we imagine the 
particle as a separate entity within the 
nucleus. The region labeled A in Fig. 30–12 represents the 
of the 
particle
when it is held within the uranium nucleus by the strong nuclear force (
is the
nuclear radius). Region C represents the 
when the 
particle is free of the
nucleus. The downward-curving 
(proportional to 1 r) represents the electrical
repulsion (Coulomb’s law) between the positively charged and the 
nucleus.
To get to region C, the particle has to get through the “Coulomb ba
