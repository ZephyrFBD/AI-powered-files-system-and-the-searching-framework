 you provide a 
general procedure, but the expected outcome is unknown; once students are comfortable 
with techniques and the construction of the choice chambers, they can design and 
conduct their own investigation based on questions they have raised. Structured inquiry 
is particularly suited for introducing scientifically naïve students to inquiry. 
■ PREPARATION 
Materials and Equipment 
•  Fruit fly cultures (approximately 30–40 fruit flies per lab group each day) 
•  Choice chambers constructed from two matching plastic water bottles and caps per  
lab group  
•  Extra caps to fit water bottles (at least six extra caps per lab group) 
•  Cotton balls with tape to secure the cotton balls (20 per lab group) 
•  A variety of materials to test on Day 2 of the experiment. Use household substances,  
including condiments like capers, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, salad dressing,
