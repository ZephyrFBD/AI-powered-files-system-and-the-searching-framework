CHAPTER 7
A nuclear collision. A proton (p) of mass 
(unified
atomic mass units) traveling with a speed of
has an elastic 
head-on collision with a helium (He) nucleus  
initially at rest.
What are the velocities of the proton and helium nucleus after the collision?
(As mentioned in Chapter 1,
but we won’t need this 
fact.) Assume the collision takes place in nearly empty space.
APPROACH Like Example 7–7, this is an elastic head-on collision, but now the
masses of our two particles are not equal. The only external force could be 
Earth’s gravity, but it is insignificant compared to the powerful forces between the 
two particles at the moment of collision. So again we use the conservation laws of
momentum and of kinetic energy, and apply them to our system of two particles.
SOLUTION We use the subscripts p for the proton and He for the helium
nucleus. We are given  
and  
We want to find the
velocities 
and 
after the collision. From conservation of momentum,
Because
