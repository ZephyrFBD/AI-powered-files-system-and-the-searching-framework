lant. In
contrast, an induced response to an assault leads to the production of a chemical that is not usually present in the
plant. One type of induced response is the wound response, illustrated in the preceding example by the production
of a volatile substance to attract insect predators. Two other examples follow:
In some plants, the hormone systemin is produced in response to the saliva of a chewing insect. As a hormone,
systemin is distributed via phloem throughout the plant, where it elicits the production of proteinase inhibitors.
Proteinase inhibitors bind to and inactivate the digestive enzymes inside the gut of the browsing insect.
In the hypersensitive response (HR), a plant recognizes an invading pathogen (virus, bacterium, or fungus) and, in
response, initiates the death of plant cells at and around the invasion site. The dead tissues serve as a blockade
against the pathogen spreading to other parts of the plant. The mechanism requires that the plant possess a resistance
