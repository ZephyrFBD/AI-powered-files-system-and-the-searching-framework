where they hang out until they get a signal to reenter the normal cell cycle.
Every cell has a life cycle—the period from the beginning of one division to the beginning of the next. The cell’s
life cycle is known as the cell cycle. The cell cycle is divided into two periods: interphase and mitosis. Take a look
at the cell cycle of a typical cell.
Special gametes split their time between interphase and meiosis.
Notice that most of the life of a cell is spent in interphase.
INTERPHASE: THE GROWING PHASE
Interphase is the time span from one cell division to another. We call this stage interphase (inter- means between)
because the cell has not yet started to divide. Although biologists sometimes refer to interphase as the “resting
stage,” the cell is definitely not inactive. During this phase, the cell carries out its regular activities. All the proteins
and enzymes it needs to grow are produced during interphase.
The Three Stages of Interphase
Interphase can be divided into three stages:
