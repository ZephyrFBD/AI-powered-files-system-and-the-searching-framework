ing and to the particular time at which that 
amount remained. (A heavy dot is made opposite both of these two related quantities.) 
When all the measurements have been recorded in this way, we connect the dots with a 
line, shown in Figure A.3. (Figures A.21–A.23 explain when to connect the data points.)

It should be clear by looking at our graph that the only measurements we actually made 
are those indicated by the dots. However, because the information on both scales of the 
graph is assumed to be continuous, we can use the graph to find out how much A would 
have been found if we had made our measurements at some other time, say 2.5 hours. 
We merely locate the line that corresponds to 2.5 hours on our time scale and follow 
it up until it crosses our line graph at the point X; then we look opposite X to the “Mg 
of A Remaining” scale, and read off 50 mg. We conclude, then, that if we had ma
