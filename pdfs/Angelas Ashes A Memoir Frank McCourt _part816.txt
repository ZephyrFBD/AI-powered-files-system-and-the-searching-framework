us back to the ship.When we’re leaving Frieda leans 
 
 toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night 
 
 in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the 
 
 361 
 
 street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in 
 
 the night air. 
 
 We climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind 
 
 yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn’t that a grand 
 
 night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father. 
 
 We watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Poughkeepsie 
 
 riverbank.The priest says good night and goes below and the 
 
 First Officer follows him. 
 
 I stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights 
 
 of America twinkling. He says,My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. 
 
 Isn’t this a great country altogether?
