10.7 ▶  The Kinetic-Molecular Theory of 
Gases Relate the macroscopic properties 
of gases to their behavior at the molecular 
level. According to the theory, the atoms 
or molecules that make up a gas are in 
constant random motion and move with an 
average kinetic energy that is proportional to 
the temperature of the gas.
 
10.8 ▶  Molecular Effusion and 
Diffusion Use kinetic-molecular theory 
to predict relative rates of effusion and 
diffusion.
 
10.9 ▶  Real Gases: Deviations from 
Ideal Behavior Consider how real gases 
deviate from ideal behavior because the gas 
molecules have finite volume and because 
attractive forces exist between molecules. 
The van der Waals equation accounts for 
real gas behavior at high pressures and low 
temperatures.
