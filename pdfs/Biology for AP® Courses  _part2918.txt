ntary canal has two openings: a mouth for ingesting food,
and an anus for eliminating waste, as shown in this nematode.
Vertebrate Digestive Systems
Through evolution, vertebrate digestive systems have adapted to different diets. Some animals have a single stomach, while
others have multi-chambered stomachs. Birds have developed a digestive system adapted to eating unmasticated food.
Monogastric: Single-chambered Stomach
As the word monogastric suggests, this type of digestive system consists of one (“mono”) stomach chamber (“gastric”).
Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in Figure 25.6ab. The process of digestion
begins with the mouth and the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically
breaking down food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The
esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smoot
