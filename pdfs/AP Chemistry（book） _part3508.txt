cess known as cracking. Hydrogen is also used to manufacture methanol via the catalytic 
reaction of CO and H2 at high pressure and temperature:
 
CO1g2 + 2 H21g2 ยก CH3OH1g2  
[22.13]
Binary Hydrogen Compounds
Hydrogen reacts with other elements to form three types of compounds: (1) ionic 
hydrides, (2) metallic hydrides, and (3) molecular hydrides.
The ionic hydrides are formed by the alkali metals and by the heavier alkaline 
earths (Ca, Sr, and Ba). These active metals are much less electronegative than hydrogen. 
 (Figure 8.8) Consequently, hydrogen acquires electrons from them to form hydride 
ions 1H -2:
 
Ca1s2 + H21g2 ยก CaH21s2 
[22.14]
The hydride ion is very basic and reacts readily with compounds having even weakly acidic 
protons to form H2 as shown in Figure 22.5 and summarized by the following equation:
 
H -1aq2 + H2O1l2 ยก H21g2 + OH -1aq2 
[22.15]
Ionic hydrides can therefore be used as convenient (although expensive) sources of H2.
