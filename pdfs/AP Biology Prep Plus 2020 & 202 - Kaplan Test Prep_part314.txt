s that rapidly
transmit chemical or electrical signals across tissues, gap junctions are
everywhere. Because chemical and electrical transmission is mediated
through the movement of ions and other messengers, gap junctions
allow for undisrupted and very fast signal transmission across wide areas
of tissue. In heart cells, gap junctions allow for rhythmic contractions of
large sections of the heart all at once. In the digestive tract, gap junctions
allow for waves of muscle contraction such as those found in the
esophagus. These junctions also allow for coordination of rapid and
complex movements, such as a fish’s tail-flip to escape an oncoming
predator. The following diagram shows a generic gap junction with many
connexin proteins that form a connexon.
Communication in Plants
Plasmodesmata are plant cells’ equivalent of gap junctions, which are
particularly useful for the free flow of nuclei from one cell to another.
These junctions in plants are not nearly as complex in structure as
