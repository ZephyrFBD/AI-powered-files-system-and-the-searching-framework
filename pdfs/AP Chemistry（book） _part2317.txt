 14.29 The decomposition reaction of N2O5 in carbon tetrachlo-
ride is 2 N2O5 ¡ 4 NO2 + O2. The rate law is first order 
in N2O5. At 64 °C the rate constant is 4.82 * 10-3 s-1.

of reaction when 3N2O54 = 0.0240 M? (c) What happens 
to the rate when the concentration of N2O5 is doubled to 
0.0480 M? (d) What happens to the rate when the con-
centration of N2O5 is halved to 0.0120 M?
 14.30 Consider the following reaction:

 (a) The rate law for this reaction is first order in H2 and 
second order in NO. Write the rate law. (b) If the rate 
constant for this reaction at 1000 K is 6.0 * 104 M -2 s-1, 
what is the reaction rate when 3NO4 = 0.035 M and 
3H24 = 0.015 M? (c) What is the reaction rate at 1000 K 
when the concentration of NO is increased to 0.10 M, 
while the concentration of H2 is 0.010 M? (d) What is the 
reaction rate at 1000 K if [NO] is decreased to 0.010 M and 
3H24 is in
