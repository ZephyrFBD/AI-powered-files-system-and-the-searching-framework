explanations for why there is emission and absorp-
tion of light by atoms at only certain wavelengths. The wavelengths of the
line spectra and the ionization energy for hydrogen (and one-electron ions) are
in excellent agreement with experiment. But the Bohr model had important 
limitations. It was not able to predict line spectra for more complex atoms—atoms
with more than one electron—not even for the neutral helium atom, which has only
two electrons. Nor could it explain why emission lines, when viewed with great
precision, consist of two or more very closely spaced lines (referred to as fine
structure). The Bohr model also did not explain why some spectral lines were
brighter than others. And it could not explain the bonding of atoms in molecules
or in solids and liquids.
From a theoretical point of view, too, the Bohr model was not satisfactory: it
was a strange mixture of classical and quantum ideas. Moreover, the wave–particle
duality was not really resolved.
