Question 17
Essential Knowledge
2.A.2: Organisms capture and store free energy for use in 
biological processes. 
2.D.1: All biological systems from cells and organisms to 
populations, communities, and ecosystems are affected 
by complex biotic and abiotic interactions involving 
exchange of matter and free energy.
Science Practice
6.2: The student can construct explanations of phenomena 
based on evidence produced through scientific practices.
Learning Objective 
2.5: The student is able to construct explanations of the 
mechanisms and structural features of cells that allow 
organisms to capture, store, or use free energy.
(A)
This option is correct. There is no change in gas volume measured by the 
respirometer unless carbon dioxide is removed, because oxygen is consumed 
at the same rate that carbon dioxide is produced during cellular respiration.
(B)
This option is incorrect because the production of oxygen by plants is by the 
process of photosynthesis, which is not the focu
