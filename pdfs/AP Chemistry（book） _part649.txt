ium(III) hydroxide reacts with nitrous acid.
 
 (c)  
Aqueous nitric acid and aqueous ammonia react.
 4.41 Write balanced molecular and net ionic equations for the 
following reactions, and identify the gas formed in each: 
 
(a) solid cadmium sulfide reacts with an aqueous solution of 
sulfuric acid; (b) solid magnesium carbonate reacts with an 
aqueous solution of perchloric acid.
 4.42 Because the oxide ion is basic, metal oxides react readily with ac-
ids. (a) Write the net ionic equation for the following reaction:
 
FeO1s2 + 2 HClO41aq2 ยก Fe1ClO4221aq2 + H2O1l2 
 
 (b) Based on the equation in part (a), write the net ionic 
equation for the reaction that occurs between NiO(s) and an 
aqueous solution of nitric acid.
