37. (II) A softball player swings a bat, accelerating it from rest
to 
in a time of 0.20 s. Approximate the bat as 
a 0.90-kg uniform rod of length 0.95 m, and compute the
torque the player applies to one end of it.
38. (II) A small 350-gram ball on the end of a thin, light rod 
is rotated in a horizontal circle of radius 1.2 m. Calculate
(a) the moment of inertia of the ball about the center of
the circle, and (b) the torque needed to keep the ball 
rotating at constant angular velocity if air resistance exerts
a force of 0.020 N on the ball. Ignore air resistance on 
the rod and its moment of inertia.
39. (II) Calculate the moment of inertia of the array of point
objects shown in Fig. 8–47 about (a) the y axis, and (b) the
x axis.Assume 
and the objects are
wired together by very light, rigid pieces of wire. The a
