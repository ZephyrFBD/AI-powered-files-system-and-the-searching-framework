le, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle.
We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic DNA is found in a central part of
the cell: the nucleoid (Figure 4.5).

Figure 4.5 This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell. All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA
localized in a nucleoid, ribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall. The other structures shown are present in some,
but not all, bacteria.
While the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old, the earliest fossil evidence for life are of microbial
mats that date back to 3.5 billion years.
What type of evidence for life was most likely found in a 3.5 billion year old rock?
a.
Scientists found bones buried in the rock that resemble bones of living animals.
b.
Dead cells buried in the rock superficially
