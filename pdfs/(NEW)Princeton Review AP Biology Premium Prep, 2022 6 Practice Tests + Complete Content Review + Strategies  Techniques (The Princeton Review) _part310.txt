here is in a population, the more likely it is that some members of the population will survive
extreme changes in the environment. Meiosis is far more likely to produce these sorts of variations than is mitosis,
which therefore confers selective advantage on sexually reproducing organisms. We’ll come back to this theme in
Chapter 10.
A Closer Look at Meiosis
Meiosis actually involves two rounds of cell division: meiosis I and meiosis II.
Before meiosis begins, the diploid cell goes through interphase. Just as in mitosis, double-stranded chromosomes are
formed during S phase.
Meiosis I
Meiosis I consists of four stages: prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I.
Prophase I
Prophase I is a little more complicated than regular prophase. As in mitosis, the nuclear membrane disappears, the
chromosomes become visible, and the centrioles move to opposite poles of the nucleus. But that’s where the
similarity ends.
The major difference involves the movement of the chromosomes. In me
