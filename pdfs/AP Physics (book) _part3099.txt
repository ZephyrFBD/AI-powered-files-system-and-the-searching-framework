5 or 6 significant figures.)
55. (II) What is the longest wavelength light capable of
ionizing a hydrogen atom in the ground state?
56. (II) What wavelength photon would be required to ionize
a hydrogen atom in the ground state and give the ejected
electron a kinetic energy of 11.5 eV?
57. (II) In the Sun, an ionized helium 
atom makes a
transition from the 
state to the 
state, emit-
ting a photon. Can that photon be absorbed by hydrogen
atoms present in the Sun? If so, between what energy
states will the hydrogen atom transition occur?
58. (II) Construct the energy-level diagram for the 
ion
(like Fig. 27–29).
59. (II) Construct the energy-level diagram for doubly ionized
lithium,
60. (II) Determine the electrostatic potential energy and the
kinetic energy of an electron in the ground state of the
hydrogen atom.
61. (II) A hydrogen atom has an angular momentum of
