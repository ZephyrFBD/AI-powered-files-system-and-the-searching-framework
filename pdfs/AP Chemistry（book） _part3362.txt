series occur in nature: uranium-238 to lead-206, uranium-235 to lead-207, and 
 
thorium-232 to lead-208. All of the decay processes in these series are either alpha 
emissions or beta emissions.

Further Observations
Two further observations can help us to predict stable nuclei:
t Nuclei with the magic numbers of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, or 82 protons or 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 
82, or 126 neutrons are generally more stable than nuclei that do not contain these 
numbers of nucleons.
t Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable 
than those with odd numbers of protons and/or neutrons. Approximately 60% of 
stable nuclei have an even number of both protons and neutrons, whereas less than 
2% have odd numbers of both (Table 21.4).
These observations can be understood in terms of the shell model of the nucleus, in 
which nucleons are described as residing in shells analogous
