is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells
are responsible for carrying the gases (red cells) and immune the response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood
clotting. Interstitial fluid that surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. In humans,
cellular components make up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. Blood is 20 percent

The Role of Blood in the Body
Blood, like the human blood illustrated in Figure 31.5 is important for regulation of the body’s systems and homeostasis.
Blood helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat.
