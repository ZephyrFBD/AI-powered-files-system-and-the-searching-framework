 avoid the
costs of parasitism. To counteract this, there will be a strong selective
pressure on the cuckoos to have eggs as similar as possible to
parrotbill eggs, to make it more diﬀicult for the parrotbills to recognize
the parasitic eggs. (D) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because unique
eggs would make it easier for parrotbills to recognize the intruders. (B)
is incorrect because the size of the eggs is not at issue in the question
stem; if anything, eggs that are the same size as the parrotbill eggs
(thereby making them harder to recognize as parasitic) would be
selected for. (C) is incorrect because a uniform, parrotbill-like
appearance would be favored over greater variation in egg

When researchers choose rats to breed based upon one characteristic,
such as running ability, there is also selection on related traits and
closely linked genes, making (A) correct. (B) is incorrect because the
question stem states that the rats were speci
