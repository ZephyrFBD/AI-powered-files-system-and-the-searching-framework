 p53 protein
(coded for by the p53 gene), a major regulator at the G1 checkpoint. Normally, p53 proteins monitor DNA. If they find cells
with damaged DNA, p53 will trigger repair mechanisms or destroy the cells, thus suppressing the formation of a tumor.
However, mutations in p53 can result in abnormal p53 proteins that fail to stop cell division if the cell’s DNA is damaged.
This results in an increased number of mutations, leading to abnormal daughter cells. Eventually, all checkpoints in the cell
become nonfunctional, and the abnormal cells can crowd out normal cells.
