lohexane. Suggest an explanation for 
cyclopropaneâ€™s reactivity. (b) Suggest a method of prepar-
ing ethylbenzene, starting with benzene and ethylene as 
the only organic reagents.
 24.38  (a) One test for the presence of an alkene is to add a small 
amount of bromine, which is a red-brown liquid, and look 
for the disappearance of the red-brown color. This test does 
not work for detecting the presence of an aromatic hydro-
carbon. Explain. (b) Write a series of reactions leading to 
para-bromoethylbenzene, beginning with benzene and 
using other reagents as needed. What isomeric side prod-
ucts might also be formed?
 24.39  The rate law for addition of Br2 to an alkene is first order 
in Br2 and first order in the alkene. Does this informa-
tion suggest that the mechanism of addition of Br2 to an 
alkene proceeds in the same manner as for addition of HBr? 
Explain.
 24.40  Describe the intermediate that is thought to form in the 
addition of a hydrogen halide to an alkene, using cycl
