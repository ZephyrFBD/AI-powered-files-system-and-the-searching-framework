Electric field obtained from voltage. Two parallel plates
are charged to produce a potential difference of 50 V. If the separation between
the plates is 0.050 m, calculate the magnitude of the electric field in the space
between the plates (Fig. 17–5).
APPROACH We apply Eq.17–4b to obtain the magnitude of E, assumed uniform.
SOLUTION The magnitude of the electric field is
NOTE Equations 17–4 apply only for a uniform electric field. The general rela-
tionship between 
and V is more complicated.

EXAMPLE 17;3
General Relation between 
and V
In a region where 
is not uniform, the connection between 
and V takes on a
different form than Eqs. 17–4. In general, it is possible to show that the electric field
in a given direction at any point in space is equal to th
