 the star appears to have a wobble.
Irregularities in the star’s motion can be measured to high accuracy, yielding
information on the size of the planets’ orbits and their masses. See Fig. 5–30 in
Chapter 5.

for this two-object system.
Total energy is also conserved. But this may not be helpful
unless kinetic energy is conserved, in which case the collision is
called an elastic collision and we can write
(7;6)
If kinetic energy is not conserved, the collision is called
inelastic.
Macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic.
A completely inelastic collision is one in which the colliding
objects stick together after the collision.
The center of mass (CM) of an extended object (or group of
objects) is that point at which the net force can be considered
to act, for purposes of determining the translational motion of
the object as a whole. The x component of the CM for objects
with mass 
is given by
