larger cells. The finger-like projection
shape is present in the middle of microvilli,
which have more surface area over the small
intestines from which they absorb nutrients and
also contains blood vessels so nutrients can enter
the blood easily.
c.
They have a greater surface area-to-volume ratio
than larger cells. The finger-like projections
prevent large particles of food from passing
through the digestive system and also contain
blood vessels so nutrients passed through them
can readily enter the bloodstream.
d.
They have a greater surface area-to-volume ratio
than larger cells. The finger-like projections aid
in mechanical digestion of food particles and
contain blood vessels so nutrients passing
through them can enter the bloodstream readily.
59. Birds have several unique physical differences from
other vertebrates, and several pertain to how birds process
food. Some differences are obvious, such as the presence
of a beak and no teeth, whereas other differences can be
observed i
