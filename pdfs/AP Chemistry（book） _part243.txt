supply two typical households for 1.00 yr. (a) If de-
salinated water costs $1950 per acre-foot, how much does 
desalinated water cost per liter? (b) How much would it cost 
one household per day if it were the only source of water?
 1.77  By using estimation techniques, determine which of 
the following is the heaviest and which is the lightest: a 
5-lb bag of potatoes, a 5-kg bag of sugar, or 1 gal of water 
1density = 1.0 g>mL2.
 1.78  Suppose you decide to define your own temperature scale 
with units of O, using the freezing point 113 째C2 and boiling 
point 1360 째C2 of oleic acid, the main component of olive 
oil. If you set the freezing point of oleic acid as 0 째O and the 
boiling point as 100 째O, what is the freezing point of water 
on this new scale?
 1.79  The liquid substances mercury 1density = 13.6 g>mL2, wa-
ter 11.00 g>mL2, and cyclohexane 10.778 g>mL2 do not form 
a solution when mixed but separate in distinct layers. Sketch 
how the liquids would position themselves in
