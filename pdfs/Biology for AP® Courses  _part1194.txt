28. Explain the roles of the positive cell cycle regulators
compared to the negative regulators.
a.
Positive regulators promote the cell cycle but
negative regulators block the cell cycle.
b.
Positive regulators block the cell division in
cancerous cells but negative regulators promote
in such cells.
c.
Positive regulators promote the cell cycle but
negative regulators arrest the cell cycle until
certain events have occurred.
d.
Positive regulators show positive feedback
mechanisms but negative regulators show
negative feedback in the cell cycle.
29. Describe what occurs at the M checkpoint and predict
what would happen if the M checkpoint failed.
a.
The M checkpoint checks for proper separation
of sister chromatids and if it fails, then cells may
undergo nondisjunction of chromosomes.
b.
The M checkpoint checks if the DNA is
damaged and promotes its repair. If it fails, then
the daughters end up with damaged DNA.
c.
The M checkpoint ensures the proper duplicat
