 reduce the dye. (D) is incorrect since oxygen is not consumed by chloroplasts.
21. (C) is correct. Energy contained in any ecosystem originates in the producers. Thus, the only way to
impact the total energy is to increase or decrease the producers. Increasing Species 1 will mean there
is more photosynthesis and therefore more energy available for the other trophic levels. On this
diagram, there are arrows from Species 1 to Organisms 2, 3, and 4. No arrows point to Species 1.
22. (B) is correct. Since these yeast cells are aerobic, they produce carbon dioxide. Yeast are not
photosynthetic, so no oxygen is being produced.
23. The correct answer is (B). (A) is incorrect since low temperatures do not cause the denaturing of
enzymes, but the low temperatures do slow the molecules and cause fewer collisions per minute. (B)
is correct since there is little to no enzyme action above 45 degrees Celsius and heat will cause
vibrations which cause the intermolecular forces in the secondary and t
