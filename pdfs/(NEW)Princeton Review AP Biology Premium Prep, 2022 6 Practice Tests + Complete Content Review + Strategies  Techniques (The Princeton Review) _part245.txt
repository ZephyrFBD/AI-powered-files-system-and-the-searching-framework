 explains the “aerobic” in aerobic respiration. If oxygen weren’t available
to accept the electrons, they wouldn’t move down the chain at all, thereby shutting down the whole process of
electron transport.
NADP+ is the terminal electron acceptor in photosynthesis, while oxygen is the
terminal electron acceptor in cellular respiration.
Chemiosmosis
At the same time that electrons are being passed down the electron transport chain, another mechanism is at work.
Remember those hydrogen ions (also called protons) that split off from the original hydrogen atom? The energy
released from the electron transport chain is used to pump hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane
from the matrix into the intermembrane space. The pumping of hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space creates
a pH gradient, or proton gradient. The hydrogen ions really want to diffuse back into the matrix. The potential
energy established in this gradient is responsible for the production of ATP. This pumpin
