they contain any N, O, or F. Phospholipids form phospholipid bilayers and
are the primary components of membranes.

6. Phospholipids have a polar end that can form hydrogen bonds
and is hydrophilic, and a nonpolar end that is hydrophobic. Based
on this information and the information given in the preceding
material, which of the following is true about the fatty acid shown
in Figure I?
The fatty acid is unlike the phospholipid because the fatty acid
does not have a hydrophilic end that interacts with water. (The
(A)
fatty acid is completely hydrophobic.) Therefore, phospholipids
can form bilayers in water while fatty acids cannot.
Like the phospholipid, the fatty acid has both a hydrophilic end
and a hydrophobic end. Therefore, fatty acids can also form
bilayers in water.

The fatty acid is unlike the phospholipid because the fatty acid
does not have a hydrophobic
