low plants to 1 green plant is expected in the offspring. It is
found that out of 100 plants phenotyped, 84 are yellow and 16 are green. Do the experimental data match the
expected data?
(A) Yes, the χ2 value is greater than 3.84.
(B) Yes, the χ2 value is smaller than 3.84.
(C) No, the χ2 value is greater than 3.84.
(D) No, the χ2 value is smaller than 3.84.
7. A mating is set up between two pure breeding strains of plants. One parent has long leaves and long shoots.
The other parent has short leaves and stubby shoots. F1 plants are collected, and all have long leaves and long
shoots. F1 plants are self-crossed, and 1,000 F2 plants are phenotyped. The data is as follows:
Phenotype
# of F2
Long leaves, long shoots
   382
Long leaves, stubby shoots
   109
Short leaves, long shoots
   112
Short leaves, stubby shoots
   397
Total
1,000
Are the genes for leaf and shoot length segregating independently?
(A) Yes; the degrees of freedom are 3, and the calculated χ2 value is small.
(B) No; the
