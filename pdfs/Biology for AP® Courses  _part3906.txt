s. A neutrophil
is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils, shown in Figure 33.3, are the most abundant
leukocytes of the immune system. Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called
lysosomes, that digest engulfed pathogens. An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a
parasite; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms).
Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi.
A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens. A
basophil is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated
in Figure 33.5. Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of
inflammatory responses. Eosinophils
