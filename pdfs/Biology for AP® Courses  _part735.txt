CHAPTER SUMMARY
6.1 Energy and Metabolism
Cells perform the functions of life through various chemical reactions. A cellâ€™s metabolism refers to the chemical reactions
that take place within it. There are metabolic reactions that involve the breaking down of complex chemicals into simpler
ones, such as the breakdown of large macromolecules. This process is referred to
