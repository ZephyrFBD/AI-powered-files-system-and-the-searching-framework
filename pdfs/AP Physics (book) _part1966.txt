t 
at the high temperature needed to make it glow (
3000 K). Thus Ohm’s 
“law” is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a description of a certain
class of materials: metal conductors, whose temperature does not change much.
Such materials are said to be “ohmic.” Materials or devices that do not follow
Ohm’s law are said to be nonohmic. See Fig. 18–9.
The unit for resistance is called the ohm and is abbreviated 
(Greek capital
letter omega). Because
we see that 
is equivalent to 
Flashlight bulb resistance. A small flashlight bulb (Fig.18–10)
draws 300 mA from its 1.5-V battery. (a) What is the resistance of the bulb?
(b) If the battery becomes weak and the voltage drops to 1.2 V, how would the
current change? Assume the bulb is approximately ohmic.
APPROACH We apply Ohm’s law to the bulb, where the voltage applied across
it is the battery voltage.
SOLUTION (a) We change 300 mA to 0.30 A and use Eq. 18–2:
(b) If the resistance stays the same, the current would be
or a decrease of
