e absence of the Coriolis effect, air would rush directly into a
region of low pressure, as shown in Fig. C–3a. But because of the Coriolis effect,
the winds are deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. C–3b),
since the Earth rotates from west to east. So there tends to be a counterclockwise
wind pattern around a low-pressure area. The reverse is true in the Southern
Hemisphere. Thus cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere
and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The same effect explains the easterly
trade winds near the equator: any winds heading south toward the equator will be
deflected toward the west (that is, as if coming from the east).
The Coriolis effect also acts on a falling object. An object released from the
top of a high tower will not hit the ground directly below the release point, but will
be deflected slightly to the east. Viewed from an inertial frame, this happens
because the top of the tower revolves with the Earth at a slightly
