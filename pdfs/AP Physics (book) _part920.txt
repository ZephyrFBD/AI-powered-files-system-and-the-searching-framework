EXAMPLE 9;2
Referring to Eq. 8–14,
we see that if an object is to remain at rest, the
net torque applied to it (calculated about any axis) must be zero. Thus we have
the second condition for equilibrium: that the sum of the torques acting on an
object, as calculated about any axis, must be zero:
(9;2)
This condition will ensure that the angular acceleration,
about any axis will 
be zero. If the object is not rotating initially
it will not start rotating.
Equations 9–1 and 9–2 are the only requirements for an object to be in equilibrium.
We will mainly consider cases in which the forces all act in a plane (we call it
the xy plane). In such cases the torque is calculated about an axis that is perpen-
dicular to the x
