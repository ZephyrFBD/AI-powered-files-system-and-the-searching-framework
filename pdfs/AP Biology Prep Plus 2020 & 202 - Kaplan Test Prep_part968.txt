the fastest rate of reaction. Therefore, as
(C) correctly states, any change in pH above or below this optimum
value would cause the enzyme to change shape, thereby decreasing
the reaction rate. (A) is incorrect because an overabundance of
cofactor has no known detrimental eﬀects; cofactors and substrates
bind to the enzyme at diﬀerent sites, so they would not be competing
against each other. Increasing the temperature increases the rate of
the reaction to a certain extent. However, raising the temperature too
high will cause bond breakage, causing the enzyme to denature and
the active site to change shape, thereby lowering the rate of reaction.
Thus, (B) is incorrect. Similarly, increasing enzyme concentration

increases the reaction rate until the point when the enzyme is no
longer the limiting factor. Therefore, the rate does not increase linearly
but rather increases rapidly before plateauing, making (D) incorrect.
