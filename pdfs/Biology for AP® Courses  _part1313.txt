esenting their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the
combinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. Each box then
represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility
is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant or
recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents,
each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible. All offspring are Yy and have yellow
seeds (Figure 12.4).
Figure 12.4 In the P generation, pea plants that are true-breeding for the dominant yellow phenotype are crossed with
plants with the recessive green phenotype. This cross produces F1 heterozygotes with a yellow phenotype. Punnett
square analysis can be used to predict the genotypes of the F2 generation.
