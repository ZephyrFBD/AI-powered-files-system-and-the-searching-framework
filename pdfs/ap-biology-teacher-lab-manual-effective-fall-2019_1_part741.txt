placed on the slide. Students make the 2% agar by mixing 
agar powder and water (2 g and 100 mL water) and heating it. Then they place it with 
an eyedropper in a puddle on the slide. They need to wait for the agar to harden to 
use as a platform for any experiments using larvae. They could also use Knox gelatin 
to make a smooth surface by following the recipe to make gelatin with one package of 
Knox gelatin to 1 cup of water. 
â–  Potential Challenges 
Students must design a controlled experiment for the choice chamber. They must be 
sure to test the chamber with distilled water to determine if there are any variables, such 
as light or the angle of the chamber, that could affect the experiment. They should be 
advised to make observations and then turn the chamber to see if the fruit flies respond 
differently. 
Although it is difficult to count fruit flies accurately, the students should work as 
a team to count as accurately as possible. One technique that works is to divide the
