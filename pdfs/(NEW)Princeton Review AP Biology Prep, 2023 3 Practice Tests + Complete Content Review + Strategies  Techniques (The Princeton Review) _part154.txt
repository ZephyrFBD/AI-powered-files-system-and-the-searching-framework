the two
monomers.
Look for This Theme!
Dehydration synthesis is a common reaction for joining things, and hydrolysis
is a common reaction for separating things.
To recap:
Organic compounds contain carbon atoms AND hydrogen atoms (and sometimes other
things too).
Inorganic compounds don’t contain both carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms.
Polymers are formed through dehydration synthesis reactions and broken down through
hydrolysis reactions.
Now let’s focus on the following four classes of organic compounds central to life on Earth:
carbohydrates
proteins
lipids
nucleic acids
A Structured Approach
While it’s a good idea to be familiar with the variety of molecules and to know
how they differ, note that for the AP Exam, you will not have to memorize the
structures of specific nucleotides, amino acids, proteins, lipids, or
carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They usually contain these three
elements in a ratio of approxim
