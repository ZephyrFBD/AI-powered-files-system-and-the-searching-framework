Plant Cultivation: Second-Generation Plants 
Step 11 You should now have two populations of second-generation seeds: (1) a 
population that is the offspring of the selected plants from generation one and (2) a 
population that is the offspring of the remaining plants from generation one. Take seeds 
from the selected population and plant them to grow the second generation of plants 
under conditions that are identical to those you used for generation one. Use new bottle 
containers or, if you choose to use the previous bottle systems, make sure that you 
thoroughly clean the systems and sterilize with a dilute (10%) bleach solution. Use new 
wicking cord and new soil. To get your seed, break open the seedpods into a small plastic 
petri dish lid. 
Step 12 When the second-generation plants are about seven to 12 days old, reexamine the 
plants and score for the trait you selected. Score the plants at the same life history stage 
using the same method. 
Step 13 Unless you plan on gr
