 linked together by a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide. The 
structures of two common disaccharides, sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar), are 
shown in Figure 24.21.
The word sugar makes us think of sweetness. All sugars are sweet, but they differ 
in the degree of sweetness we perceive when we taste them. Sucrose is about six times 
sweeter than lactose, slightly sweeter than glucose, but only about half as sweet as

fructose. Disaccharides can be reacted with water (hydrolyzed) in the presence of an 
acid catalyst to form monosaccharides. When sucrose is hydrolyzed, the mixture of glu-
cose and fructose that forms, called invert sugar,* is sweeter to the taste than the origi-
nal sucrose. The sweet syrup present in canned fruits and candies is largely invert sugar 
formed from hydrolysis of added sucrose.
Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are made up of many monosaccharide units joined toget
