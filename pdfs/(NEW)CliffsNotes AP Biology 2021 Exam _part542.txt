ated by metabolizing fat (in some animals in specialized fat deposits called brown fat). In this process,
oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is decoupled from the electron transport chain when the permeability of
the inner mitochondrial membrane to H+ is increased. This neutralizes the proton gradient, and, as a result, heat is
generated instead of ATP.
3. Adjusting surface area to regulate temperature. The extremities of bodies (arms, hands, feet, ears) add
considerable surface area to the body. By changing the volume of blood that flows to these areas by vasodilation or
vasoconstriction (increasing or decreasing the diameter of blood vessels), heat can be lost or conserved. In hot
environments, for example, elephants and jackrabbits increase blood flow to their large ears to reduce body
temperature. In contrast, animals in cold environments reduce blood flow to their ears, hands, and feet to conserve
heat. Surface area can also be adjusted by behavioral mechanisms: Huddling in
