anisms, as long as the appropriate region of DNA can be isolated and
the right combination of restriction enzymes can be determined. The
most important thing to remember from this lab is that smaller
fragments move farther on the gel. They move farther because they are
smaller. All of the fragments move for the same reason: they are charged
molecules moving away from an applied charge of the same kind
(positive or negative).

CHAPTER:
Nitrogenous base pairs make up DNA and RNA: adenine pairs
with thymine (DNA only) or uracil (RNA only) and cytosine pairs
with guanine.
1.
DNA replication is a semiconservative process, in which one of
the antiparallel strands of DNA is preserved and the other
strand is newly synthesized. New nucleotides are added in a 5′
to 3′ direction.
2.
In transcription, the DNA strands separate and mRNA copies
one side. The mRNA takes the information to the ribosome,
where protein sy
