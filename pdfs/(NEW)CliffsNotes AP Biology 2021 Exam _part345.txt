 strains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an
HIV-like virus in monkeys, recombined to create HIV.
The high rates of mutation in viruses intensify their pathogenicity because host populations do not evolve immune-
system defenses as fast as the viruses evolve. Note that HIV, influenza (flu) viruses, and most of the viruses that
cause the common cold are all RNA viruses. These viruses mutate and evolve quickly, producing new strains on a
regular (or seasonal) basis and, as a result, remain infectious throughout the human lifetime.
Prokaryotes
Archaea and bacteria are prokaryotes. They do not contain a nucleus, nor do they possess any of the specialized
organelles of eukaryotes. The primary genetic material of prokaryotes is a chromosome consisting of a single,
circular DNA molecule without the proteins associated with the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes. A prokaryotic
cell reproduces by binary fission. In binary fission, the chromosome replicates and the cell divides into two cells,
