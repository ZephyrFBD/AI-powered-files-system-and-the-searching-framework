Imperial College funded by the Gates Foundation and GAVI, the
‘vaccine alliance’, created by Gates as his personal vaccine
promotion operation? To compound the human catastrophe that
Ferguson’s ‘models’ did so much to create he was later exposed for
breaking his own lockdown rules by having sexual liaisons with his
married girlfriend Antonia Staats at his home while she was living at
another location with her husband and children. Staats was a
‘climate’ activist and senior campaigner at the Soros-funded Avaaz
which I wouldn’t trust to tell me that grass is green. Ferguson had to
resign as a government advisor over this hypocrisy in May, 2020, but
aĞer a period of quiet he was back being quoted by the ridiculous
media on the need for more lockdowns and a vaccine rollout. Other
government-advising ‘scientists’ from Imperial College’ held the fort
in his absence and said lockdown could be indeﬁnite until a vaccine
was found. The Cult script was being sung by the payrolled choir.
