Compare orbits of objects

Other Centers for Kepler’s Laws
The derivation of Eq. 5–7b, Kepler’s third law, compared two planets revolving
around the Sun. But the derivation is general enough to be applied to other systems.
For example, we could apply Eq. 5–7b to compare an artificial satellite and our
Moon, both revolving around Earth (then 
would be replaced by 
the mass
of the Earth). Or we could apply Eq. 5–7b to compare two moons revolving around
Jupiter. But Kepler’s third law, Eq. 5–7b, applies only to objects orbiting the same
attracting center. Do not use Eq. 5–7b to compare, say, the Moon’s orbit around
Earth to the orbit of Mars around the Sun:they depend on different attracting centers.
Distant Planetary Systems
Starting in the mid-1990s, planets revolving around distant stars (Fig. 5–30)
were inferred from the regular “wobble” in position
