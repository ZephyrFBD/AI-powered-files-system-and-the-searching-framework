ry that organisms descend from a common ancestor
gradually, over a long period of time, in a linear or branching fashion. Big
changes occur by an accumulation of many small ones. According to this
theory, fossils should exist as evidence of every stage in the evolution of
every species with no missing links. However, the fossil record is at odds
with this theory because scientists rarely find transitional forms or
missing links.

Populations of organisms continue to evolve.
Punctuated Equilibrium
The favored theory of evolution today is called punctuated equilibrium
and was developed by Stephen J. Gould and Niles Eldredge after they
observed that the gradualism theory was not supported by the fossil record.
This theory proposes that new species appear suddenly after long periods
of stasis. A new species changes most as it buds from a parent species and
then changes little for the rest of its existence. The sudden appearance of
