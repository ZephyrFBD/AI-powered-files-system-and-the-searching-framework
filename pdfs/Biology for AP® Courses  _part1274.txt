the support for the theory of evolution provided by this
evidence and, additionally, by the absence of any
alternative process.
31. Meiotic phases of yeast cells were observed
microscopically with fluorescent markers (Nachman et al.,
Cell, 131(3), 2007) to determine the time intervals of
meiosis I and meiosis II. The data are displayed in the
following figure:
Figure 11.11
The duration of meiosis I is measured relative to the
transfer of spores to the growth medium. The duration of
meiosis II is measured relative to the emergence from
meiosis I. On the y-axis, the fraction of cells observed to
enter each phase are shown, where the sampling has been
made in increments of 0.5 hours.
A.
Qualitatively compare the mean and standard
deviation for these two distributions.
B.
The gene Ime1 is transcribed at the start of
meiosis I in response to nitrogen starvation. This
activates Ime2 that interacts with Ime1. If,
during meiosis I, the cells are supplied with
nitrogen, meiosis is halted.
