CHAPTER 17 Additional Aspects of Aqueous Equilibria
To understand how a buffer works, let’s consider one composed of a weak acid HA 
and one of its salts MA, where M+ could be Na+, K+, or any other cation that does not 
react with water. The acid-dissociation equilibrium in this buffered solution involves 
both the acid and its conjugate base:
 
HA1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + A-1aq2 
[17.3]
The corresponding acid-dissociation-constant expression is
 
Ka =
3H+43A-4
3HA4
 
[17.4]
Solving this expression for 3H+4, we have
 
3H+4 = Ka
3HA4
3A-4  
[17.5]
We see from this expression that 3H+4 and, thus, the pH are determined by two factors:
t
the value of Ka for the weak-acid component of the buffer;
t the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate acid–base pair, 3HA4>3A-4.
If OH- ions are added to this buffered solution, they react with the buffer acid com-
ponent to produce water and A-:
 
OH-1aq2 + HA1aq2 ¡ H2O1l2 + A-1aq2  
[17.6]
This neutralization reaction causes 3HA4
