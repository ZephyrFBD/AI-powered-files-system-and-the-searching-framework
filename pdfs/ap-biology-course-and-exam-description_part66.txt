Required Course Content 
TOPIC 1.1
Structure of Water and 
Hydrogen Bonding
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-1.A
Explain how the properties 
of water that result from 
its polarity and hydrogen 
bonding affect its biological 
function.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.A.1
The subcomponents of biological molecules 
and their sequence determine the properties of 
that molecule.
SYI-1.A.2
Living systems depend on properties of water 
that result from its polarity and hydrogen 
bonding.
SYI-1.A.3
The hydrogen bonds between water 
molecules result in cohesion, adhesion, 
and surface tension.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-1
Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural level
