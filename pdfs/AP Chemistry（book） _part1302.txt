 an octet of electrons around the central atom 
are often called hypervalent. Other examples of hypervalent species are SF4, AsF -
6 , and 
ICl4
-. The corresponding molecules with a second-period atom as the central atom, such 
as NCl5 and OF4, do not exist.
Hypervalent molecules are formed only for central atoms from period 3 and below in the 
periodic table. The principal reason for their formation is the relatively larger size of the central 
atom. For example, a P atom is large enough that five F (or even five Cl) atoms can be bonded to 
it without being too crowded. By contrast, an N atom is too small to accommodate five atoms 
bonded to it. Because size is a factor, hypervalent molecules occur most often when the central 
atom is bonded to the smallest and most electronegative atomsâ€”F
, Cl, and O.
The notion that a valence shell can contain more than eight electrons is also consistent 
with the presence of unfilled nd orbitals in atoms from period 3 and below.
