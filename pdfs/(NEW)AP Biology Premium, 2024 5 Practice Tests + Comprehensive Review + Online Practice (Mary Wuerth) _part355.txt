would require the least amount
of energy to break those hydrogen bonds and separate the DNA strands. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all
incorrect because they have higher G-C contents than choice (A).
4. (B) Only DNA contains thymine, and only RNA contains uracil. Choice (A) is incorrect because RNA has a
five-carbon sugar (ribose), not a four-carbon sugar. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine and cytosine, so
choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because DNA is typically double-stranded and RNA is typically
single-stranded.
5. (A) After one round of DNA replication, every molecule of DNA would contain one parent strand (containing
N-15) and one newly synthesized strand (containing N-14). Choice (B) is incorrect because it describes the
expected result from conservative DNA replication, not semiconservative replication. Choices (C) and (D) are
both incorrect because after one round of DNA replication, no DNA molecules would contain solely N-15 or N-
14.
6. (D) As shown in Figure
