use the eggs are divided unequally, the quality of cytoplasmic substances varies among the daughter
cells. Nonuniform distribution of cytoplasm results in embryonic axes, which influence subsequent divisions and
division of the cytoplasm. In addition, substances unique to certain daughter cells may promote gene expression that
turns on (or off) genes specific to the development and differentiation of that cell.
15. B. Since there is no pressure applied to the distilled water in the
 
beaker (Ψp = 0) and since there are no solutes in the distilled water (Ψs = 0), the value of Ψ for the distilled water is
Ψ = Ψp + Ψs = 0 + 0 = 0. 16. C. There are solutes in the cytoplasm of cells, so Ψs < 0.
 
17. A. Pressure is applied to the contents of the cell by the cell wall, so
 
Ψp > 0.
 
18. C. The value of Y for the potato cell is negative before the potato is put into the water. This is because Ψ for any
normally hydrated plant
 
cell is negative (that is, Ψs is more negative than Ψp is positi
