States of Matter
A sample of matter can be a gas, a liquid, or a solid. These three forms, called the states 
of matter, differ in some of their observable properties.

"gas (also known as vapor) has no fixed volume or shape; rather, it uniformly fills 
its container. A gas can be compressed to occupy a smaller volume, or it can expand 
to occupy a larger one.
t 
"liquid has a distinct volume independent of its container, assumes the shape of the 
portion of the container it occupies, and is not compressible to any appreciable extent.
t 
"solid has both a definite shape and a definite volume and is not compressible to 
any appreciable extent.
The properties of the states of matter can be understood on the molecular level (Figure 1.4). 
In a gas the molecules are far apart and moving at high speeds, colliding repeatedly with 
one another and with the walls of the container. Compressing a gas decreases the amount 
of space between molecules and increases the frequency of co
