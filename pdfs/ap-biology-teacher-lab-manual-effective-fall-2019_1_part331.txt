can help jump-start your thinking. 
•  What factors determine the rate and direction of osmosis? 
•  What would you predict if you used a starch solution instead of the protein? 
•  Can you diagram the flow of water based upon the contents of your model cell and 
the surrounding solution? 
•  When will the net osmosis rate equal zero in your model cells? Will it ever truly be 
zero? 
•  Based upon your observations, can you predict the direction of osmosis in living cells 
when the cells are placed in various solutions? 
•  How is the dialysis tubing functionally different from a cellular membrane? 
■ Procedure 3: Observing Osmosis in Living Cells 
The interactions between selectively permeable membranes, water, and solutes are 
important in cellular and organismal functions. For example, water and nutrients move 
from plant roots to the leaves and shoots because of differences in water potentials. 
Based upon what you know and what you have learned about osmosis, diffusion, and 
water
