 numbers into a calculator, you will obtain 
because
the denominator differs from 1 by such a tiny amount. The time measured by an
observer fixed on Earth would show no difference from that measured by the
driver, even with the best instruments. A computer that could calculate to a large
number of decimal places would reveal a slight difference between 
and 
NOTE We can estimate the difference using the binomial expansion (Appendix A–5),
In our time dilation formula, we have the factor
Thus†
So the difference between 
and 
is predicted to be 
an extremely
small amount.
EXERCISE B A certain atomic clock keeps precise time on Earth. If the clock is taken
on a spaceship traveling at a speed
does this clock now run slow according to
the people (a) on the spaceship, (b) on Earth?
