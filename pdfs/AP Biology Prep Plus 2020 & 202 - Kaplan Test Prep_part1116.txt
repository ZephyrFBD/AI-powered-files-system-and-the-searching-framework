e 1. Change in frequency of the alleles Tt for
tail length over three generations of cheetahs
Questions 51–54 refer to the following material.
Anoles are a group of lizard species from the genus Anolis that are widespread in
the Americas and have successfully adapted to life in multiple diﬀerent ecological
niches. Given their many diverse forms and environments, anoles have been used
to study evolutionary processes in nature.
A research group studying communication displays in reptiles found that several
species of anoles have ultraviolet (UV) photoreceptors in their eyes, providing the
ability to detect UV light. Furthermore, multiple studies have found that the
males’ dewlap, a large flap of skin under the chin that can be expanded, is
Long tails are superior to short tails, supported by the increasing
frequency of the T allele. 
(A)
The frequency of alleles for long tails only has become fixed by the
third generation.
(B)
Both harmful and beneficial alleles are kept due to natural s
