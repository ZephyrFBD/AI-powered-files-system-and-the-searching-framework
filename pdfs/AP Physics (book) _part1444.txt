ces tend to pull the molecules closer together so
the volume is less than expected from the ideal gas law. At still lower temperatures,
these forces cause liquefaction, and the molecules become very close together.
Curve D represents the situation when liquefaction occurs. At low pressure
on curve D (on the right in Fig. 13–21), the substance is a gas and occupies a large
volume. As the pressure is increased, the volume decreases until point b is reached.
From point b to point a, the volume decreases with no change in pressure; the
substance is gradually changing from the gas to the liquid phase. At point a, all of
the substance has changed to liquid. Further increase in pressure reduces the
volume only slightly—liquids are nearly incompressible—so on the left the curve
is very steep as shown. The shaded area under the gold dashed line represents the
region where the gas and liquid phases exist together in equilibrium.
Curve C in Fig. 13–21 represents the behavior of the substance at i
