mologous chromosomes dissociate
from the spindle fibers during metaphase I, they
move randomly to the daughter cells.
c.
The homologous chromosomes are paired tightly
during metaphase I and undergo crossover as the
synaptonemal complex forms a lattice around
them.
d.
Recombination of maternal and paternal
chromosomes occurs in metaphase I because the
homologous chromosomes are not connected at
their centromeres.

the running you can do to stay in the same place,”
describes co-evolution between competing species.

a.
When a sexually reproducing species and an
asexually reproducing species compete for the
same resources, they both “run [evolve] in the
same place” because the increased genetic
variation in the sexually reproducing species
balances the loss in energy it uses to find and
attract mates.
b.
When one species gains an advantage with a
favorable variation, selection increase
