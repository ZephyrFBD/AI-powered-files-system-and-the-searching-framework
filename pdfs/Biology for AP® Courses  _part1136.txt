An organism’s ploidy count is the total number of chromosome sets contained in each body cell. Most
organisms have a ploidy level of 2, meaning that they have two sets of chromosomes due to presence
of homologous pairs. However, some plants are multiploid, meaning they can have ploidy levels greater
than 2. The table shows possible multiploid levels of some common crop plants.

Analyze the data with a partner of in a group as directed by your teacher. On a separate sheet of paper,
answer the following questions.
a.
How does the multiploid count of the crop plants relate to their normal chromosome count?
b.
Explain the basis for the relationship you described in part a, in terms of what occurs to chromosomes
during replication and meiosis.
c.
Give one
