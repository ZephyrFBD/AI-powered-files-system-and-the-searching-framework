amorphous solid
▲ Figure 12.2 Examples of crystalline and 
amorphous solids. The atoms in crystalline 
solids repeat in an orderly, periodic fashion 
that leads to well-defined faces at the 
macroscopic level. This order is lacking in 
amorphous solids like obsidian (volcanic 
glass).

▲ Figure 12.3 A crystalline lattice in two 
dimensions. An infinite array of lattice 
points is generated by adding together the 
lattice vectors a and b. The unit cell is a 
parallelogram defined by the lattice vectors.
*A vector is a quantity involving both a direction and a magnitude. The magnitudes of the 
vectors in Figure 12.3 are indicated by their lengths, and their directions are indicated by the 
arrowheads.
**You may wonder why the hexagonal unit cell is not shaped like a hexagon. Remember that the unit 
cell is by definition a parallelogram whose size and shape are defined by the lattice vectors a and b.
