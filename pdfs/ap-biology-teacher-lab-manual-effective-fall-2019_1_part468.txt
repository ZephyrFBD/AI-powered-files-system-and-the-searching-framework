â– BACKGROUND
One of the characteristics of living things is the ability to replicate and pass on genetic 
information to the next generation. Cell division in individual bacteria and archaea 
usually occurs by binary fission. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also replicate by binary 
fission, which is evidence of the evolutionary relationship between these organelles and 
prokaryotes. 
Cell division in eukaryotes is more complex. It requires the cell to manage a 
complicated process of duplicating the nucleus, other organelles, and multiple 
chromosomes. This process, called the cell cycle, is divided into three parts: interphase, 
mitosis, and cytokinesis (Figure 1). Interphase is separated into three functionally 
distinct stages. In the first growth phase (G1), the cell grows and prepares to duplicate its 
DNA. In synthesis (S), the chromosomes are replicated; this stage is between G1 and the 
second growth
