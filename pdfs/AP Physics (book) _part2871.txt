by hand. Estimate the maximum angular
magnification achievable for a telescope designed to be
handheld. Assume its eyepiece lens, if used as a magnify-
ing glass, provides a magnification of 
for a relaxed eye
with near point
41. (III) A reflecting telescope (Fig. 25–22b) has a radius of
curvature of 3.00 m for its objective mirror and a radius of
curvature of 
for its eyepiece mirror. If the distance
between the two mirrors is 0.90 m, how far in front of the
eyepiece should you place the electronic sensor to record
the image of a star?
42. (III) A 
pair of binoculars has an objective focal length
of 26 cm. If the binoculars are focused on an object 4.0 m
away (from the objective), what is the magnification?
(The

for objects at infinity and not for nearby ones.)
25–5 Microscopes
43. (I) A microscope uses an eyepiece with a focal length of
1.70 cm. Using a normal eye with a final image at infinity, the
barrel length is 17.5 cm and the
