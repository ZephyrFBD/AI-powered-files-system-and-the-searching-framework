The size of the gas bubble at the top of the inverted test tube is measured after 30 minutes, and that data are
displayed in the following table.

(a) Describe why a gas bubble would form in each tube.
(b) Identify the independent variable, the dependent variable, and at least one experimental control.
(c) Predict the size of the gas bubble if the experiment was repeated with a water bath at a temperature of
25°C.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
4. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter. The binding of acetylcholine to membrane receptors starts a cell
signaling cascade in neurons.
(a) Describe the three steps in cell signaling.
(b) Explain how cell signals are amplified in the cell.
(c) An autoimmune disorder produces antibodies that bind to the acetylcholine receptors, blocking them.
Predict the effect this would have on
