actions. If the protein is
subject to changes in temperature, changes in pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its
shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the
primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to
resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein
denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not
all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at
temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion
process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these condition
