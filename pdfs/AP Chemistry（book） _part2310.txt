 14.14 Draw a possible transition state for the bimolecular reac-
tion depicted here. (The blue spheres are nitrogen atoms, 
and the red ones are oxygen atoms.) Use dashed lines to 
represent the bonds that are in the process of being bro-
ken or made in the transition state. [Section 14.6]
no intermediates. (b) Calculate the average rate of disap-
pearance of A for each 40 s interval in units of mol>s. (c) 
Which of the following would be needed to calculate the 
rate in units of concentration per time: (i) the pressure of 
the gas at each time, (ii) the volume of the reaction flask, 
(iii) the temperature, or (iv) the molecular weight of A?
