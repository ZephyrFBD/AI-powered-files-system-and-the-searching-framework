RNA primase catalyzes the synthesis of RNA primers.
If you are interested in some of the history behind the early DNA experiments,
we have included a short addendum in your online student tools. It will not,
however, be tested.
Central Dogma
DNA’s main role is directing the manufacture of molecules that actually do the work in the body. DNA is just the
recipe book, not the chef or the meal. When a DNA recipe is used, scientists say that that DNA is expressed.
The first step of DNA expression is to turn it into RNA. The RNA is then sent out into the cell and often gets turned
into a protein. Proteins are the biggest group of “worker-molecules,” and most expressed DNA turns into proteins.
These proteins, in turn, regulate almost everything that occurs in the cell.
The process of making an RNA from DNA is called transcription, and the process of making a protein from an
RNA is called translation. In eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the nucleus (where the DNA is kept)
