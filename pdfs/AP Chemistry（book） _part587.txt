 the atoms in the mole-
cule or ion. We use the following rules for assigning oxidation numbers:
1. For an atom in its elemental form, the oxidation number is always zero. Thus, each H 
atom in the H2 molecule has an oxidation number of 0, and each P atom in the P4 
molecule has an oxidation number of 0.
2. For any monatomic ion, the oxidation number equals the ionic charge. Thus, K+ has an 
oxidation number of +1, S2- has an oxidation number of -2, and so forth.

In ionic compounds the alkali metal ions (group 1A) always have a 1+ charge and 
therefore an oxidation number of +1. The alkaline earth metals (group 2A) are al-
ways +2, and aluminum (group 3A) is always +3 in ionic compounds. (In writing 
oxidation numbers, we will write the sign before the number to distinguish them 
from the actual electronic charges, which we write with the number first.)
3. Nonmetals usually have negative oxidation numbers, although they can some-
