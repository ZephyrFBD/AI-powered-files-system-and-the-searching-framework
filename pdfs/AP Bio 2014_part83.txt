51. In animals, the hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that are important for proper development of 
embryonic segments and are widely conserved in organisms. The figure below shows the embryonic segments in 
which one such gene, Hoxc6, is expressed in the embryo of a mouse, a chick, and a goose. Embryonic segments 
are counted from the anterior end. 
During the formation of vertebrae, the most anterior embryonic segment that expresses Hoxc6 marks the end of 
the cervical (neck) vertebrae and the beginning of the thoracic (rib) vertebrae. All mammals have seven cervical 
vertebrae. 
  
 
 
 
  Which of the following statements is most likely to be true? 
(A) The chick and the goose have the same number of thoracic vertebrae. 
(B) The most anterior expression of Hoxc6 is the eighth vertebra in mammals. 
(C) Hoxc6 is expressed in the same embryon
