■ Counting, Measuring, and Calculating 
Counting is one of the most common activities of biological observation, yet it is

a tree slice, the trichome hairs on a petiole of a Wisconsin Fast Plant®, or the number 
of stomata on a leaf. However, more difficult counts involve the number of individuals 
in a population, such as ants in an anthill, the number of red blood cells in a milliliter 
of blood on a hemocytometer slide, or the number of leaves on a tree. These counts 
often involve sampling a subpopulation, using a technique such as capture-mark­
and-recapture, or employing a quadrat or transect in field work followed by simple
