Figure 3.8 Sucrose is formed when a monomer of glucose and a monomer of fructose are joined in a dehydration
reaction to form a glycosidic bond. In the process, a water molecule is lost. By convention, the carbon atoms in a
monosaccharide are numbered from the terminal carbon closest to the carbonyl group. In sucrose, a glycosidic linkage
is formed between carbon 1 in glucose and carbon 2 in fructose.
Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose (Figure 3.9). Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the
monomers glucose and galactose. It is found naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed by a
dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, whi
