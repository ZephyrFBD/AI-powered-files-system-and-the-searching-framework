e telegram 
 
 boy, here’s the telegram boy.They run to you and the women wait at 
 
 the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he’s the hero 
 
 of the family. Little girls know they’re supposed to wait till the boys get 
 
 their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. 
 
 Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but 
 
  
  
 if you’re in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God 
 
 bless you an’ all belongin’ to you. 
 
 Mrs. O’Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day 
 
 our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else.We are not to be doing 
 
 things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of 
 
 message.They don’t care if people are dying in the bed.They don’t care 
 
 if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor.We are to deliver 
 
 the telegram and that’s all. Mrs. O’Connell says, I know everything ye 
 
 do, everything, for the people of Lime
