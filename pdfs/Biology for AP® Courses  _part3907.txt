and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes.
A hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by
basophils and mast cells.
Figure 33.5 In response to a cut, mast cells secrete histamines that cause nearby capillaries to dilate. Neutrophils and
