is essential as you help students find their own questions. For 
the first year, you may not feel comfortable dedicating the time beyond becoming 
familiar with simply growing these organisms. As you develop an understanding for the 
organisms and how your own students interact with them, you can then proceed to more

Resist the urge to answer students’ questions; rather, encourage your students to work 
out answers for themselves. Figure 5, a flow chart/concept map of the investigation, 
may aid you in helping your students focus on some ideas for research. Also consult the 
supplemental resources listed at the end of this investigation. There you will find many 
examples of research that answer ecologi
