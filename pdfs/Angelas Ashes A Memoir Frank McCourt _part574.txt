’t know, he’s only eleven and he had that typhoid 
 
 and the coal dust wouldn’t be good for his eyes. 
 
 Bridey says, He’d be out in the air and there’s nothing like fresh air 
 
 for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn’t that right, 
 
  
  
 Frankie? 
 
 ’Tis, Bridey. 
 
 I’m dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a 
 
 real workingman. If I’m good at it they might let me stay at home from 
 
 school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn’t interfere 
 
 with school and he can start on a Saturday morning. 
 
 I’m a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and 
 
 make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to 
 
 come out with his bicycle and there’s a lovely smell of rashers and eggs 
 
 coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of 
 
 food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she 
 
 married him.They’re like two lovers out of an American film the way
