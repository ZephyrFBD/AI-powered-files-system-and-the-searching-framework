CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
What is the significance of the sign of ∆E? Notice that ∆E is pos-
itive when nf is greater than ni. That makes sense to us because 
that means the electron is jumping to a higher-energy orbit. Con-
versely, ∆E is negative when nf is less than ni; the electron is falling 
 
in energy to a lower-energy orbit.
As noted above, transitions from one allowed state to another 
will involve a photon. The energy of the photon 1Ephoton2 must equal the 
difference in energy between the two states 1∆E2. When ∆E is positive, a 
photon must be absorbed as the electron jumps to a higher energy. 
When ∆E is negative, a photon is emitted as the electron falls to a 
lower-energy level. In both cases, the energy of the photon must 
match the energy difference between the states. Because the fre-
