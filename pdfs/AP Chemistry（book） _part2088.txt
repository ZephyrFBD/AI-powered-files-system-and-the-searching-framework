ous solution will have the lowest freezing point?
(a) 0.050 m CaCl2 (b) 0.15 m NaCl (c) 0.10 m HCl  
(d) 0.050 m CH3COOH (e) 0.20 m C12H22O11
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Referring to Table 13.3, calculate the freezing point of a solu-
tion containing 0.600 kg of CHCl3 and 42.0 g of eucalyptol 
1C10H18O2, a fragrant substance found in the leaves of euca-
lyptus trees.

Sample Exercise 13.8 
Calculation of Boiling-Point Elevation and Freezing-Point Depression
Plan To calculate the boiling-point elevation and the freez-
ing-point depression using Equations 13.12 and 13.13, we must 
express the concentration of the solution as molality. Let’s assume 
for convenience that we have 1000 g of solution. Because the 
solution is 25.0% by mass ethylene glycol, the masses of ethylene 
glycol and water in the solution are 250 and 750 g, respectively. 
Using these quantities, we can calculate the molality of the solu-
tion, which we use with the molal boiling-point-elevation and 
freezing-point-d
