r apoptosis. Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of
potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell. There are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cell’s health; if
abnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis. However, in some cases, such as a
viral infection or uncontrolled cell division, the cell’s normal checks and balances fail. External signaling can also initiate
apoptosis. For example, most normal animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a network of
glycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an organism. The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular
matrix initiates a signaling cascade within the cell. However, if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix, the
signaling ceases, and the cell undergoes apoptosis. This system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating
out of control.
