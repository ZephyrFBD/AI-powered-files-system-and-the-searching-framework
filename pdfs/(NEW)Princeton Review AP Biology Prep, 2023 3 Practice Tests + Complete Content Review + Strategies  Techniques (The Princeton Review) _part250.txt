ck into NAD+ and takes its electrons. The pyruvate turns into either lactic
acid (in muscles) or ethanol (in yeast). Since these two things are toxic at high concentrations, this process, called
fermentation, is done only in emergencies. Aerobic respiration is a better option.
What types of organisms undergo fermentation?
Yeast cells and some bacteria make ethanol and carbon dioxide.
Other bacteria produce lactic acid.
Your Muscle Cells Can Ferment
Although human beings are aerobic organisms, they can actually carry out fermentation in their muscle cells. Have
you ever had a leg cramp? If so, that cramp was possibly the consequence of anaerobic respiration.
When you exercise, your muscles require a lot of energy. To get this energy, they convert enormous amounts of
glucose to ATP. But as you continue to exercise, your body doesnâ€™t get enough oxygen to keep up with the demand
in your muscles. This creates an oxygen debt. What do your muscle cells do? They switch over to anaerobic
respir
