 an intermediate generated in the forward reaction of step 1. Interme-
diates are usually unstable and have a low, unknown concentration. Thus, the rate law of 
Equation 14.30 depends on the unknown concentration of an intermediate, which isn’t 
desirable. We want instead to express the rate law for a reaction in terms of the reactants, 
or the products if necessary, of the reaction.
With the aid of some assumptions, we can express the concentration of the inter-
mediate NOBr2 in terms of the concentrations of the starting reactants NO and Br2. We 
first assume that NOBr2 is unstable and does not accumulate to any significant extent in 
the reaction mixture. Once formed, NOBr2 can be consumed either by reacting with NO 
to form NOBr or by falling back apart into NO and Br2. The first of these possibilities is 
step 2 of our alternative mechanism, a slow process. The second is the reverse of step 1, a 
unimolecular process:

Because step 2 is slow, we ass
