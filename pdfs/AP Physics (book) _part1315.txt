erference to occur, the person must be one-half wavelength
farther from one loudspeaker than from the other, or 0.15 m. Thus the person
must be 3.85 m or 4.15 m from the second speaker.
NOTE If the speakers are less than 0.15 m apart, there will be no location that
is 0.15 m farther from one speaker than the other, and there will be no place
where destructive interference could occur.

Beats—Interference in Time
We have been discussing interference of sound waves that takes place in space.
An interesting and important example of interference that occurs in time is the
phenomenon known as beats: if two sources of sound—say, two tuning forks—
are close in frequency but not exactly the same, sound waves from the two sources
interfere with each other. The sound level at a given position alternately rises and
falls in time, because the two waves are sometimes in phase and sometimes out of
phase due to their d
