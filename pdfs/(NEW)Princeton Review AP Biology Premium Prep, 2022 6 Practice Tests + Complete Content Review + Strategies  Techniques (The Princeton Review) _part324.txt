t “wins out” and
directs the phenotype is the dominant allele. The one that doesn’t show up in the phenotype is the recessive
allele.
Simple genetics with dominants and recessives was illuminated by Gregor Mendel. In Mendelian genetics, there
are three important laws: the Law of Dominance, the Law of Segregation, and the Law of Independent
Assortment.
If two genes are on the same chromosome and close together, they are linked. Completely linked alleles on the
same chromosome are locked together and travel together during gamete formation. Recombination frequency
can be used to measure how far apart two genes are on a chromosome.
Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes for a total of 46. Of these, 22 pairs are autosomes and 2 are
designated as sex chromosomes:
Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X and one Y chromosome.
Because females have two X chromosomes, one is inactivated in each cell and condenses into a Barr body.
