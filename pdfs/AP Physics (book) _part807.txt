
During the 8.0-s time interval, the carousel accelerates from 
to
.
(b) The linear velocity of the child with 
at time 
is found 
using Eq. 8–4:
Note that the “rad”has been omitted in the final result because it is dimensionless
(and only a reminder)—it is a ratio of two distances, Eq. 8–1a.
Angular and linear accelerations. For the child on the
rotating carousel of Example 8–4, determine that child’s (a) tangential (linear)
acceleration, (b) centripetal acceleration, (c) total acceleration.
APPROACH We use the relations discussed above, Eqs. 8–5 and 8–6.
SOLUTION (a) The child’s tangential acceleration is given by Eq. 8–5:
and it is the same throughout the 8.0-s acceleration period.
(b) The child’s centripetal acceleration at 
is given by Eq. 8–6:
aR = v2
r
= (1.2 ms)2
(2.5 m)
= 0.58 ms2.
t = 8.0 s
atan = ra = (2.5 m)A0.060 rads2B
= 0.15 ms2,
EXAMPLE 8;5
v = rv = (2.5 m)(0.48 rads) = 1.2 ms.
t = 8.0 s
r = 2.5 m
v2 = 0.48 rads
v1 = 0
v2 = v1 + k ¢t = 0 + A0.060 rads2B(8.0 s) =
