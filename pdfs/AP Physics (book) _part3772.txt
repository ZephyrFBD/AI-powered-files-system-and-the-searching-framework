 only the
pull of visible matter, suggesting a great deal of invisible matter. Similarly,
observations of the motion of galaxies within clusters also suggest that they have
considerably more mass than can be seen. Furthermore, theory suggests that
without dark matter, galaxies and stars probably would not have formed and
would not exist. Dark matter seems to hold the universe together.
What might this nonluminous matter in the universe be? We don’t know yet.
But we hope to find out soon. It cannot be made of ordinary (baryonic) matter,
so it must consist of some other sort of elementary particle, perhaps created at
a very early time. Perhaps it is made up of previously undetected weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs), possibly supersymmetric particles (Section 32–12)
such as neutralinos. We are anxiously awaiting the results of intense searches for
such particles, looking both at what arrives from far out in the cosmos with
underground detectors†, and by producing them in partic
