 even if a protein is made, it might need other
things to be made (or not made) in order for the protein to be functional.
Gene Regulation in Embryonic Development
How does a tiny, single-celled egg develop into a complex, multicellular organism? By dividing, of course. The cell
changes shape and organization many times by going through a succession of stages. This process is called
morphogenesis.
When an egg is fertilized by a sperm, it forms a diploid cell called a zygote.
Fertilization triggers the zygote to go through a series of cell divisions. As these occur, the embryo becomes
increasingly differentiated, or specialized. An undifferentiated cell is like a blank slateâ€”it can become any type of
cell. Once a cell begins to specialize, it is limited in its future options.
In order for a cell to differentiate, it must change. Certain genes will be expressed, and other genes might be turned
off. Cells called organizers release signals that let each cell know how they should develop. A
