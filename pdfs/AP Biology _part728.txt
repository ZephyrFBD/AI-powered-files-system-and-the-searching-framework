–70 mV to almost –50 mV (meaning it becomes less
polarized), and the line goes upward. A similar occurrence happens
in choice B, which is why that choice is also incorrect. Choice D is
incorrect because the stimulus causes an action potential: the neuron
becomes depolarized, and you can see that an impulse passes.
(B) The membrane potential reads zero when there is no differential
between one side of the membrane and the other. The greater the
differential, the more negative the potential. Therefore, –80 mV is
more polarized than –70 mV.
(C) A nerve response is all-or-none. There is no such thing as a small
action potential. If the stimulus gets stronger, there will be an
increase in the frequency of the action potentials.
(D) Neurotransmitter is normally released from presynaptic vesicles
into the synapse, where it binds to postsynaptic vesicles on the
skeletal muscle cell and causes the muscle to contract.
Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that normally breaks down
