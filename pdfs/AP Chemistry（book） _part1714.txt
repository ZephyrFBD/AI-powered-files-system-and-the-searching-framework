e into stronger dispersion forces, which in turn lead to higher boiling points.
n-Pentane (C5H12)
bp = 309.4 K
Neopentane (C5H12)
bp = 282.7 K
Linear molecule—larger 
surface area enhances
intermolecular contact and 
increases dispersion force.
Spherical molecule—smaller 
surface area diminishes 
intermolecular contact and 
decreases dispersion force.
▲ Figure 11.6 Molecular shape affects 
intermolecular attraction. Molecules of 
n-pentane make more contact with each 
other than do neopentane molecules. Thus, 
n-pentane has stronger intermolecular 
attractive forces and therefore a higher 
boiling point.
*The n in n-pentane is an abbreviation for the word normal. A normal hydrocarbon is one in 
which the carbon atoms are arranged in a straight chain. 
 (Section 2.9)
Molecular shape also influences the magnitude of dispersion forces. For example, 
n-pentane* and neopentane (Figure 11.6) have the same molecular formula 1C5H122, yet 
the boiling point of n-pentane is about 27 K higher tha
