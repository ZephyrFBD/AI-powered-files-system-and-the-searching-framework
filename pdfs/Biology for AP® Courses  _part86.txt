made by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Penicillin was
discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open. An unwanted
mold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out to be Penicillium, and a new antibiotic was discovered.
Even in the highly organized world of science, luck—when combined with an observant, curious mind—can lead to
unexpected breakthroughs.
Reporting Scientific Work
Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other
researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists—when planning, conducting,
and analyzing results—are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist’s work are
communicating with peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific
meeting
