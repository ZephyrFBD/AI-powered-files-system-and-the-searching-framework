rgy, therefore, is required to vaporize a liquid or melt a solid than to break covalent 
bonds. For example, only 16 kJ>mol is required to overcome the intermolecular attrac-
tions in liquid HCl to vaporize it. In contrast, the energy required to break the covalent 
bond in HCl is 431 kJ>mol. Thus, when a molecular substance such as HCl changes from 
solid to liquid to gas, the molecules remain intact.
Many properties of liquids, including boiling points, reflect the strength of the 
intermolecular forces. A liquid boils when bubbles of its vapor form within the liquid. 
The molecules of the liquid must overcome their attractive forces to separate and form a 
vapor. The stronger the attractive forces, the higher the temperature at which the liquid 
boils. Similarly, the melting points of solids increase as the strengths of the intermolec-
ular forces increase. As shown in Table 11.2, the melting and boiling points of substances 
in which the particles are held together by chemical bond
