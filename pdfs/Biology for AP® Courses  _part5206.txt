the milk?’ He points out that streptomycin is a ‘nephrotoxic’ or
poisonous-to-the-kidney drug. You will see the relevance of that
shortly. Cowan says that it gets worse, much worse, when Enders
describes the culture medium upon which the virus ‘grows’: ‘The
culture medium consisted of bovine amniotic ﬂuid (90%), beef
embryo extract (5%), horse serum (5%), antibiotics and phenol red as
an indicator of cell metabolism.’ Cowan asks incredulously: ‘Did he
just say that the culture medium also contained ﬂuids and tissues
that are themselves rich sources of genetic material?’ The genetic
cocktail, or ‘medium’, is inoculated onto tissue and cells from rhesus
monkey kidney tissue. This is where the importance of streptomycin
comes in and currently-used antimicrobials and other drugs that are
poisonous to kidneys and used in ALL modern viral cultures (e.g.
gentamicin, streptomycin, and amphotericin). Cowan asks: ‘How are
you ever going to know from this witch’s brew where any genetic
