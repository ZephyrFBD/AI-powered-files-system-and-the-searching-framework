the tendency 
of the reduction to occur; the more positive the value for E°
red, the 
greater the tendency of the substance to be reduced. Substances 
that are easily reduced act as strong oxidizing agents; thus, E°
red pro-
vides a measure of the oxidizing strength of a substance. Substances 
that are strong oxidizing agents produce products that are weak re-
ducing agents and vice versa.
FREE ENERGY AND REDOX REACTIONS (SECTION 20.5) The 
emf, E, is related to the change in the Gibbs free energy, ∆G = -nFE, 
where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred during the 
redox process and F is the Faraday constant, defined as the quantity

of electrical charge on one mole of electrons: F = 96,485 C>mol. 
Because E is related to ∆G, the sign of E indicates whether a redox 
process is spontaneous: E 7 0 indicates a spontaneous process, and 
E 6 0 indicates a nonspontaneous one. Because ∆G is also related to 
the equilibrium constant for a reaction 1
