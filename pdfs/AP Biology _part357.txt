f DNA that was cut with
restriction enzymes. Lane 1 has four bands of DNA: three larger pieces
and one short piece. Lane 2 contains two pieces of DNA: one large one
and one tiny one. Lane 3 contains one very large, uncut piece of DNA.
Lane 4 contains two pieces of DNA. The smaller the piece of DNA, the
farther it has traveled from the well.
DNA Probe
A DNA probe is a radioactively labeled single strand of nucleic acid
molecule used to tag a specific sequence in a DNA sample. The probe
bonds to the complementary sequence wherever it occurs, and the
radioactivity enables scientists to detect its location. The DNA probe is
used to identify a person who carries an inherited genetic defect, such as
sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, Huntington’s disease, and hundreds
of others.
