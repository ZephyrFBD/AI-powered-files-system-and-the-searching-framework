 surface
such a satellite must orbit, and (b) such a satellite’s speed. (c) Compare to the
speed of a satellite orbiting 200 km above Earth’s surface.
APPROACH To remain above the same point on Earth as the Earth rotates,
the satellite must have a period of 24 hours. We can apply Newton’s second law,
where  
if we assume the orbit is circular.
SOLUTION (a) The only force on the satellite is the gravitational force due
to the Earth. (We can ignore the gravitational force exerted by the Sun. Why?)
We apply Eq. 5–6 assuming the satellite moves in a circle:
This equation has two unknowns, r and v. So we need a second equation. The
satellite revolves around the Earth with the same period that the Earth rotates
on its axis, namely once in 24 hours. Thus the speed of the satellite must be
where  
We substitute this into the
“satellite equation” above and obtain (after cancelling 
on both sides):
After cancelling an r, we can solve for 
We take the cube root and find
