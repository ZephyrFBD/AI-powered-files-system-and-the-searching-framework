a.
the unusual abundance of iridium in the
Cretaceous-Paleogene layers, the disappearance
of so many species at its transition, volcanic
activity that led to global warming, and the
crater found in the Yucatan peninsula
b.
the unusual abundance of iridium in the
Cretaceous-Paleogene layers, gamma-ray burst
caused by a nearby supernova, rocks found in
the clay layer at its boundary, and the crater
found in the Yucatan peninsula

Cretaceous-Paleogene layers, the disappearance
of so many species at its transition, rocks found
in the clay layer at its boundary, asteroid impact,
