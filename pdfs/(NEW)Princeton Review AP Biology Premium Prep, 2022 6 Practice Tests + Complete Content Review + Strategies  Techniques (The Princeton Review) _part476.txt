strate causation. Scatterplots are used to present data from association
experiments. Each data point is plotted as a dot. Suppose different substrate concentrations are used in an enzymatic
reaction (using the enzyme Kozmase III), and the enzyme efficiency is measured (in percent of maximum). The data
could be presented like this.
If the relationship looks linear, a linear regression line can be added. There are a few common shapes of scatterplots
you should be familiar with:
A bell-shaped curve is associated with random samples and normal distributions.
An upward curve (concave in shape) is associated with exponentially increasing functions. A common example
of this is the lag phase of bacterial growth in a liquid culture.
A curve that looks like the sine wave is common when biological rhythms are being studied.
PROBABILITY
You already saw an introduction to probability calculations in Chapter 8 of this book. The probability (P) that an
event will occur is the number of favorable cas
