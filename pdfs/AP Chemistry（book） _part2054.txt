, for a constant total pressure of 1 atm in the gas phase.
Because gas solubility increases with increasing pressure, divers who 
breathe compressed air (Figure 13.17) must be concerned about the 
solubility of gases in their blood. Although the gases are not very 
soluble at sea level, their solubilities can be appreciable at deep lev-
els where their partial pressures are greater. Thus, divers must as-
cend slowly to prevent dissolved gases from being released rapidly 
from solution and forming bubbles in the blood and other ﬂuids 
in the body. These bubbles affect nerve impulses and cause decom-
pression sickness, or “the bends,” which is a painful and potentially 
fatal condition. Nitrogen is the main problem because it is the most 
abundant gas in air and because it can be removed from the body 
only through the respiratory system. Oxygen, in contrast, is con-
sumed in metabolism.
Deep-sea divers sometimes substitute helium for nitrogen in the 
air they breathe because helium has
