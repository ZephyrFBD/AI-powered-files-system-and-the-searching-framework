(a) What are the overall reaction orders for the reactions described in Equations 14.9 and 14.11?
(b) What are the units of the rate constant for the rate law in Equation 14.9?
Sample Exercise 14.5
 Determining Reaction Orders and Units for Rate Constants
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given two rate laws and asked to express (a) the 
overall reaction order for each and (b) the units for the rate con-
stant for the first reaction.
Plan The overall reaction order is the sum of the exponents in the 
rate law. The units for the rate constant, k, are found by using the 
normal units for rate 1M>s2 and concentration (M) in the rate law 
and applying algebra to solve for k.
Solve
(a) The rate of the reaction in Equation 14.9 is ﬁrst order in N2O5 
and ﬁrst order overall. The reaction in Equation 14
