 change (or clean and dry) the cap after each choice unless 
the same substance is used again. 
•  New flies should be added if the experiment continues beyond the first day. However, 
if the flies are still active at the end of the first day, students can return them to a 
culture vial by tapping the chamber into a funnel placed in the culture vial.

T206  Investigation 12  
 ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK 
■
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to 
interactions (big idea 4) or to cellular processes (big idea 2), specifically the capture, use, 
and storage of free energy. In addition, some of the questions are likely to connect to big 
idea 1 if students explore the evolution of observed behaviors. As always, it is important 
to make connections between big ideas and enduring understandings, regardless 
of where in the curriculum the lab is taught. The concepts align with the enduring 
understandings and learnin
