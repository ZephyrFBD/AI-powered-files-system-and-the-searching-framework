Which of the following is a valid comparison between the dialysis
tube and the plasma membrane of a red blood cell?
NaCl can never exit a red blood cell because it is composed of
ions, but it can cross the dialysis tube membrane.
(A)
Albumin can permeate a red blood cell membrane, but it
cannot cross the dialysis tube membrane because of its size.
(B)
Both membranes are similar in
