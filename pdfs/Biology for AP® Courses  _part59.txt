Introduction
Viewed from space, Earth offers no clues about the diversity of life it harbors. The first forms of life on Earth are thought
be microorganisms that existed for billions of years in the ocean before plants and animals appeared. The mammals, birds,
and flowers that we see in modern times are mostly “recent” species, originating 130 to 200 million years ago. In fact, only
in the last 200,000 years have humans started looking like we do today.
Organisms evolve in response to each other. One of the best examples is disease causing organisms, which have to adapt
to overcome the defenses of the organisms they infect. One such organism tha
