Sample Integrative Exercise 
Putting Concepts Together
Note: Integrative exercises require skills from earlier chapters as well as ones from the present chapter.
A sample of 70.5 mg of potassium phosphate is added to 15.0 mL of 0.050 M silver nitrate, resulting in the formation of a 
precipitate. (a) Write the molecular equation for the reaction. (b) What is the limiting reactant in the reaction? (c) Calculate  
the theoretical yield, in grams, of the precipitate that forms.
SOLUTION
AgNO3. Because both reactants are strong electrolytes, the 
solution contains K+, PO4
3-, Ag+, and NO3
- ions before the 
reaction occurs. According to the solubility guidelines in 
Table 4.1, Ag+ and PO4
3- form an insoluble compound, so
