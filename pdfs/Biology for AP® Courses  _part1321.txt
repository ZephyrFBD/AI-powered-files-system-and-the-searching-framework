 follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism. If Mendel had chosen an experimental system that
exhibited these genetic complexities, it’s possible that he would not have understood what his results meant.
Incomplete Dominance
Mendel’s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring
exhibited a blend of their parents’ traits. However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate
between the two parents. For example, in the snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus (Figure 12.7), a cross between a homozygous
parent with white flowers (CWCW) and a homozygous parent with red flowers (CRCR) will produce offspring with pink
flowers (CRCW). (Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns
from simple dominance and recessiveness.) This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting
