e-breeding,” pea plants. These are
plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel
avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden
pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short
time. Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his
results did not come about simply by chance.

Mendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. In the pea
