ologous chromosomes for a total of 46. Of these, 22 pairs are autosomes and 2 are
designated as sex chromosomes:
Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X and one Y chromosome.
Because females have two X chromosomes, one is inactivated in each cell and condenses into a Barr body.
Non-Mendelian genetics refers to a situation in which traits do not follow the Mendelian laws. Examples
include:
incomplete dominance
codominance
polygenic inheritance
Meiosis produces four genetically distinct haploid gametes (sperm or egg cells). Meiosis involves two rounds of
cell division: meiosis I and meiosis II.
During meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs separate, but before they can, they undergo crossing-
over and swap some DNA.
During meiosis II, sister chromatids separate.
Mutations, such as nondisjunction events or whole chromosome translocations, can lead to genetic diseases.
