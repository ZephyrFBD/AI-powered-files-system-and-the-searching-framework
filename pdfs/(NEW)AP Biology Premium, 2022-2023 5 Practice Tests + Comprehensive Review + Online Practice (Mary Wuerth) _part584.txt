 a model of a cell with a
semipermeable membrane. Each of six pieces of dialysis tubing are filled with one of six different unknown
solutions with various sucrose concentrations (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 molar). The sucrose molecule is
approximately twice as large as a glucose molecule and is too large to pass through the pores in the dialysis tubing.
Each model cell is massed and then placed in a beaker of distilled water for at least 30 minutes. Then they are
massed again, and the percent change in mass for each bag is calculated. Water will move into the dialysis bags.
Bags that contain a solution with the highest sucrose concentration (lowest water potential) will gain more mass and
have a greater percent change in mass during the allotted time than bags that contain a solution with a lower sucrose
concentration (and a relatively higher water potential). By comparing the percent changes in mass of each bag, the
concentration of sucrose in each bag can be identified.
