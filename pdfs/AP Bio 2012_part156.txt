 expression and observed 
differences between different kinds of organisms.
(A)
This option is correct. Arabinose will bind with the repressor protein allowing 
expression of the genes controlled by the ara regulatory sequences. Because 
the genes for ampicillin resistance and GFP were inserted downstream of the 
regulatory sequences, these genes will be expressed and the products will cause 
the resultant colonies to be green under UV light. This answer indicates that 
the student is able to describe the connection between the regulation of gene 
expression and observed differences between different kinds of organisms. 
(B)
This option is incorrect because the presence of ampicillin in the agar would not 
allow growth of bacteria without the plasmid, but those with the plasmid would 
not have increased GFP.
(C)
This option is incorrect because without arabinose the gene sequences 
downstream from the ara regulatory sequence would not be expressed.
(D)
This option is incorrect because
