e the molecules
are flowing up their concentration gradient.
(B)
Process C requires the input of energy because the molecules
are moving from an area of low concentration to an area of high
concentration.
(C)
None of these processes require the input of energy because
they all occur spontaneously.
(D)
10. Which of the following most likely depicts the transport of a
nonpolar substance?
The molecules in process A are able to cross without aid
through the nonpolar fatty acid tails of the membrane.
(A)
The molecules in process B are able to cross through a channel
protein, which is necessary because the fatty acid tails are
polar.
(B)
The molecules in process C are nonpolar because only
nonpolar substances can be moved against their concentration
gradient.
(C)
None of the molecules shown in these processes can be
nonpolar.
(D)
11. Hypernatremia is defined as the condition of having too much
sodium in the blood plasma. When this occurs, the sodium
diï¬€uses into the interstitial fluid, causi
