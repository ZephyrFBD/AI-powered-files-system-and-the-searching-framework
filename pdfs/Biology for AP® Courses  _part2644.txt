Some plants have special adaptations that help them to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Carnivorous
plants, such as the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant (Figure 23.29), grow in bogs where the soil is low

evolved to provide these plants with a supplementary source of much-needed nitrogen.

Figure 23.29 The (a) Venus flytrap has modified leaves that can capture insects. When an unlucky insect touches
the trigger hairs inside the leaf, the trap suddenly closes. The opening of the (b) pitcher plant is lined with a
slippery wax. Insects crawling on the lip slip and fall into a pool of water in the bottom of the pitcher, where they
are digested by bacteria. The
