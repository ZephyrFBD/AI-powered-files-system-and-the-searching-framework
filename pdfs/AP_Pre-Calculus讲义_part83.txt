 a tan kx have period π/k. 
Thus one complete period of the graphs of these functions occurs on any interval of length  
π/k. 
To sketch a complete period of these graphs, it’s convenient to select an interval between 
vertical asymptotes. 
To graph one period of y = a tan kx, an appropriate interval is

3.5 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 
3.5.1 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 
The inverse of a function f is a function f-1 that reverses the rule of f. 
For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one. Since the trigonometric functions 
are not one-to-one, they do not have inverses. 
It is possible, however, to restrict the domains of the trigonometric functions in such a way 
that the resulting functions are one-to-one. 
 
3.5.2 The Inverse Sine Function 
Let's first consider the sine function. There are many ways to restrict the domain of sine so 
that the new
