rotates with the other vectors, so the instantaneous voltage V (projec-
tion of 
on the x axis) is (see Fig. 21–45)
The voltage V across the whole circuit must equal the source voltage (Fig. 21–43).
Thus the voltage from the source is out of phase with the current by an angle 
From this analysis we can now determine the total impedance Z of the
circuit, which is defined in analogy to resistance and reactance as
