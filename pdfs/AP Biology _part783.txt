rated the
importance of the cytoplasm associated with the gray crescent in the
normal development of an animal. He bisected embryos very early in their
development in different ways. Only the cell that contained the gray
crescent developed normally. In addition, these experiments provided
more proof that the cytoplasm plays a major role in determining the course
of embryonic development; see Figure 18.11.

Embryonic Induction

Embryonic induction is the ability of one group of embryonic cells to
influence the development of another group of embryonic cells. Spemann
proved that the dorsal lip of the blastopore normally initiates a chain of
inductions that results in the formation of a neural tube. In the now-
famous experiment, he grafted a piece of dorsal lip from one amphibian
embryo onto the ventral side of a second amphibian embryo. What
