re inverse square laws
Both also have a
proportionality to a property of each object—mass for gravity, electric charge for
electricity. And both act over a distance (that is, there is no need for contact).
A major difference between the two laws is that gravity is always an attractive force,
whereas the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Electric charge
comes in two types, positive and negative; gravitational mass is only positive.
The constant k in Eq. 16–1 is often written in terms of another constant,
called the permittivity of free space. It is related to k by
