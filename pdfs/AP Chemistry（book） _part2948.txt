CTION 18.3) Earth’s water is largely in the 
oceans and seas; only a small fraction is freshwater. Seawater con-
tains about 3.5% by mass of dissolved salts and is described as having 
a salinity (grams of dry salts per 1 kg seawater) of 35. Seawater’s den-
sity and salinity vary with depth. Because most of the world’s water 
is in the oceans, humans may eventually need to recover freshwater 
from seawater. The global water cycle involves continuous phase 
changes of water.
HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND WATER QUALITY (SECTION 18.4)  
Freshwater contains many dissolved substances including dis-
solved oxygen, which is necessary for fish and other aquatic life. 
Substances that are decomposed by bacteria are said to be biode-
gradable. Because the oxidation of biodegradable substances by 
aerobic bacteria consumes dissolved oxygen, these substances 
are called oxygen-demanding wastes. The presence of an excess 
amount of oxygen-demanding wastes in water can sufficiently 
deplete the dissolved oxy
