lays only a minor role in the abscission process. ABA accumulates
as a response to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths. Its
activity counters many of the growth-promoting effects of GAs and auxins. ABA inhibits stem elongation and induces
dormancy in lateral buds.
ABA induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins. Plants adapted
to temperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate. This mechanism protects young
plants from sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter. As the hormone gradually breaks down over
winter, the seed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring. Another effect of ABA
is to promote the development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud. Low
soil moisture causes an increase in ABA, which causes stomata to close, red
