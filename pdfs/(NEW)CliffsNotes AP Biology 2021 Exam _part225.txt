ukaryotes. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, all body cells
except those that produce eggs and sperm (or pollen).
In contrast, meiosis ends with four haploid daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes (one
chromosome from every homologous pair). In order for one of these haploid cells to produce a “normal” cell with
the full set of chromosomes, it must first combine with a second haploid cell to create a diploid cell. In other words,
meiosis produces gametes, that is, eggs and sperm (or pollen), for sexual reproduction. The fusing of an egg and a
sperm, fertilization (or syngamy), gives rise to a diploid cell, the zygote. The single-celled zygote then divides by
mitosis to produce a multicellular organism. Note that one copy of each chromosome in the zygote originates from
one parent, and the second copy from the other parent. Thus, a pair of homologous chromosomes in the diploid
zygote represents both maternal and paternal heritage.
