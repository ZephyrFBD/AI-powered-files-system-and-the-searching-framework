stem. When the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot
stems are arranged in a ring. In plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together
and produce the characteristic growth rings. In monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the
ground tissue (Figure 23.9).
Figure 23.9 In (a) dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged around the periphery of the ground tissue. The xylem
tissue is located toward the interior of the vascular bundle, and phloem is located toward the exterior. Sclerenchyma
fibers cap the vascular bundles. In (b) monocot stems, vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem tissues are
scattered throughout the ground tissue.
Xylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements. The latter two types conduct water
and are dead at maturity. Tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified. Water moves from one
tracheid to an
