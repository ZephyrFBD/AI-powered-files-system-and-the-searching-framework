 lines, what is the magnetic flux
through the loop? (b) The plane of the loop is rotated until
it makes a 42° angle with the field lines. What is the angle 
in Eq. 21–1 for this situation? (c) What is the magnetic flux
through the loop at this angle?
8. (II) (a) If the resistance of the resistor in Fig. 21–60 is slowly
increased, what is the direction
of the current induced in the
small circular loop inside the
larger loop? (b) What would
it be if the small loop were
placed outside the larger one,
to the left?
Explain your

10. (II) A circular loop in the plane of the paper lies in a
0.65-T magnetic field pointing into the paper. The loop’s
diameter changes from 20.0 cm to 6.0 cm in 0.50 s. What is
