We therefore speak of the probability that the electron will be in a certain region of 
space at a given instant. As it turns out, the square of the wave function, c2, at a 
given point in space represents the probability that the electron will be found at 
that location. For this reason, c2 is called either the probability density or the 
electron density.
Give It Some Thought
What is the difference between stating “The electron is located at a particular point 
in space” and “There is a high probability that the electron is located at a particular 
point in space”?
One way of representing the probability of finding the electron in various regions of 
an atom is shown in Figure 6.17, where the density of the dots represents the probability 
of finding the electron. The regions with a high density of dots correspond to relatively 
large values for c2 and are therefore regions where there is a high probability of finding 
the electron. Based on this representation, w
