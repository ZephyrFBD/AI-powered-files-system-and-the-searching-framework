ruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes. The most obvious difference between
members of viral families is their morphology, which is quite diverse. An interesting feature of viral complexity is that the
complexity of the host does not correlate with the complexity of the virion. Some of the most complex virion structures are
observed in bacteriophages, viruses that infect the simplest living organisms, bacteria.
Morphology
Viruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family. All virions have a nucleic
acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins, called a capsid. The capsid is made up of protein subunits called
capsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “spheres,” whereas others are quite complex in structure.
In general, the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups: filamentous, isometric (or icosahedral), enveloped, and head
and tail. Filamentous viruses are long and cylindrical. Many plant
