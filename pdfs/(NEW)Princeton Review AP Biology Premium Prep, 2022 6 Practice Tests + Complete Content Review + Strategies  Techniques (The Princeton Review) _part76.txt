ontrols that are used in this experiment. In addition, the experiment includes a 7-
day waiting period between when the bacterial transplant takes place. Justify why this is necessary. (3 points)
One important control is the use of a clean swab. Another control is to deposit the interdigital swab onto another
interdigital space. These are important to confirm that the process of applying the swab to the new area is not a
tainted or contaminated process. The 7-day waiting period is important to allow the new bacteria to compete a little
with the existing bacteria. Then we can better judge which bacteria is going to stick around in the new site.
(c) Interpret the effect of the transplants between interdigital web space and the buttock, external auditory canal,
and plantar heel areas. (3 points)
When deposited on the buttock, the bacteria community already on the buttock did not get changed much. The
existing bacteria still made up the community. This means the interdigital bacteria didnâ€™
