Now consider an event that occurs at some point P (Fig. E–1) represented by
the coordinates

at the time 
What will be the coor-
dinates of P in S? Since S and

have moved a distance 
Therefore, at time 
The y and z coordi-
nates, on the other hand, are not altered by motion along the x axis; thus 
and
Finally, since time is assumed to be absolute in Galilean–Newtonian physics,
clocks in the two frames will agree with each other; so 
We summarize these
in the following Galilean transformation equations:
[Galilean] (E;1)
These equations give the
