ed for counting the number of particles (or
decays of a radioactive isotope). There are also devices that allow the track of
charged particles to be seen. Very important are semiconductor detectors. Silicon
wafer semiconductors have their surface etched into separate tiny pixels, each
providing particle position information. They are much used in elementary par-
ticle physics (Chapter 32) to track the positions of particles produced and to
determine their point of origin and or their momentum (with the help of a
magnetic field). The pixel arrangement can be CCD or CMOS (Section 25â€“1),
the latter able to incorporate electronics inside, allowing fast readout.
One of the oldest tracking devices is the photographic emulsion, which can
be small and portable, used now particularly for cosmic-ray studies from balloons.
A charged particle passing through an emulsion ionizes the atoms along its path.
These points undergo a chemical change, and when the emulsion is developed
(like film) the part
