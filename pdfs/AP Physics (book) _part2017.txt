t after they have been on for some time.
11. Which draws more current, a 100-W lightbulb or a 75-W
bulb? Which has the higher resistance?
12. Electric power is transferred over large distances at very
high voltages. Explain how the high voltage reduces power
losses in the transmission lines.
13. A 15-A fuse blows out repeatedly. Why is it dangerous to
replace this fuse with a 25-A fuse?
14. When electric lights are operated on low-frequency ac (say,
5 Hz), they flicker noticeably. Why?
15. Driven by ac power, the same electrons pass back and
forth through your reading lamp over and over again.
Explain why the light stays lit instead of going out after the
first pass of electrons.
16. The heating element in a toaster is made of Nichrome wire.
Immediately after the toaster is turned on, is the current
magnitude 
in the wire increasing, decreasing, or staying
constant? Explain.
17. Is current used up in a resistor? Explain.
18. Why is it more dangerous to turn on an electric appliance
