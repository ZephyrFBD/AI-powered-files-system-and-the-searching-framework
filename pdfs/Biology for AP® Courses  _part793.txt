All organisms, from simple bacteria and yeast to complex plants and animals, carry out some form of cellular respiration
to capture and supply free energy for cellular processes. Although cellular respiration and photosynthesis evolved as
independent processes, today they are interdependent. The products of photosynthesis, carbohydrates and oxygen gas, are
used during cellular respiration. Likewise, the byproduct of cellular respiration, CO2 gas, is used during photosynthesis.
Glycolysis is the first pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract free energy. Used by nearly all organisms on
earth today, glycolysis likely evolved as one of the first metabolic pathways. It is important to note that glycolysis occurs in
the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. (Remember that only eukaryotic cells have mitochondria.)
Like all metabolic pathways, glycolysis occurs in steps or s
