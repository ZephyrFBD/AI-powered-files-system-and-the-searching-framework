intensity of the detector signal versus ion atomic 
mass is called a mass spectrum (Figure 2.12). Analysis of a mass spec-
trum gives both the masses of the ions reaching the detector and 
their relative abundances, which are obtained from the signal 
 
intensities. Knowing the atomic mass and the abundance of each 
 
isotope allows us to calculate the atomic weight of an element, as 
shown in Sample Exercise 2.4.
Mass spectrometers are used extensively today to identify chemi-
cal compounds and analyze mixtures of substances. Any molecule that 
loses electrons can fall apart, forming an array of positively charged frag-
ments. The mass spectrometer measures the masses of these fragments, 
producing a chemical “fingerprint” of the molecule and providing clues 
about how the atoms were connected in the original molecule. Thus, a 
chemist might use this technique to determine the molecular structure 
of a newly synthesized compound, to analyze proteins in the human ge-
nome, or to identi
