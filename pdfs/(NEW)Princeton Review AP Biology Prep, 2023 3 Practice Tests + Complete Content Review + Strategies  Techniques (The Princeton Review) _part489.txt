represent the number of independent variables in the data. In most cases, this is
the number of possibilities being compared minus one. In this example, DF = 4 – 1, because we are comparing four
different family types.
You also need a reference p-value. This is the probability of observing a deviation from the expected results due to
chance. For most biological tests, a p-value of 0.05 is used.
Since we are using DF = 3 and p = 0.05, the critical value is 7.82 (according to the chart above). Next, the critical
value is compared to the χ2 value; if χ2 < CV, you accept H0. If χ2 > CV, you reject Ho. We calculated an χ2 value of
6.24, which is smaller than 7.82. Since χ2 < CV, we accept Ho and conclude that offspring sex could, indeed, be
segregating independently in this dataset.
