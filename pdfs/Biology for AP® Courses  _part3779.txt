tic regulation is the process by which the mineral salts
and water are kept in balance. Osmotic homeostasis is maintained despite the influence of external factors like temperature,
diet, and weather conditions.
Osmotic balance is especially important in the brain. The brain is 80% water, and osmotic balance between water and spinal
fluid is critical to proper brain function. Too much or too little water can cause severe medical conditions. Researchers have
recently discovered the mechanism that controls water flow between brain cells. The speed of water flow is controlled by
water channels called aquaporin channels, which are controlled by a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid. You
