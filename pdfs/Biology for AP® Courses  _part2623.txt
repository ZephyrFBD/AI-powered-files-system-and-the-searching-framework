ntent described in this section, specifically root anatomy, is not within the scope of AP®. However, in the
Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants module, we will explore the role of roots in absorbing water necessary for
photosynthesis, transporting minerals and other nutrients, and storing carbohydrates.
When we explored mitosis in the Cell Reproduction chapter, you may have examined a root meristem under the microscope.
The meristem is comprised of actively dividing cells. However, just like animal organs and organ systems, plant structures,
including roots, interact to provide specific functions. For example, water is absorbed through the root system and travels
upward through xylem to the leaves, where it is used in photosynthesis. (See the Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
module.)
With the exceptions described in the AP® Connection, information presented in this section, and the examples highlighted,
