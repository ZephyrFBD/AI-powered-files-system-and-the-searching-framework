 either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or 
 
  
  
 sauntering around in police uniforms. 
 
 You’re lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I’d 
 
 give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway 
 
 without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, 
 
 Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up 
 
 the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus.We grew 
 
 up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything 
 
 and signs on, we’re mothers before we’re women. And there’s nothing 
 
 here but rain and oul’ biddies saying the rosary. I’d give me teeth to get 
 
 out, go to America or even England itself.The champion pint drinker 
 
 is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me 
 
 so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.
