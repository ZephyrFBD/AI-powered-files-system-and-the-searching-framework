t to research on cancer and aging.
Additionally, the molecular basis of Mendelian genetics
was established.
A. The mechanism of DNA replication was investigated
by Meselson and Stahl. The diagram below from their
1958 paper summarizes their findings. Describe how this
representation illustrates the manner in which DNA is
copied for transmission between generations.

B. During the synthesis of new strands of DNA from the

parent strands, DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides
at the terminal 3â€™ of a growing strand. Using the diagram
below, describe the similarities and differences between
the DNA replication of both strands.

C. Shown at the left end of the upper parent strand is the
six-base repeat sequence TTAGGG. In humans, this is the
repeated, telomeric sequence that is attached to the
telomere. The RNA primer in humans spans 10 base pairs,
unlike in the drawing where it spans only three. In somatic
cells, an enzym
