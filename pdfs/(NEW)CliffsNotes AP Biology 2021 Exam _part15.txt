 (you can skip the college’s introductory course in biology and take an advanced course), or
both. You should check with the biology department at the colleges you’re interested in to determine how they
award credit for the exam. The distribution of student scores for some recent AP Biology exams is shown here.
The multiple-choice section is designed with a balance of easy and difficult questions to produce a mean score of
50% (on one recent test, the actual mean was 55%). Free-response questions are also designed to obtain a 50% mean
score, but scores vary significantly with individual questions and from year to year. On the 2011 exam, mean scores
for a free-response question ranged from 3.98 to 4.87 (out of a possible 10 points). Clearly, both sections of the
exam are difficult. They are deliberately written that way so that the full range of students’ abilities can be
