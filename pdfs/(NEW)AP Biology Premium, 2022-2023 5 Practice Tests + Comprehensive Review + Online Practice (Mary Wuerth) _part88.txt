re nonpolar macromolecules that function in energy storage, cell membranes, and insulation. (See Figure
4.3.) One of the building blocks of lipids is fatty acids. Fatty acids with the maximum number of C–H single bonds
are called saturated, are solid at room temperature, and usually originate in animals. Fatty acids with at least one
C=C double bond are called unsaturated, are liquid at room temperature, and usually originate in plants. How a lipid
functions in a cell is dependent on the lipid’s saturation level.
Phospholipids are extremely important in cell membranes. They are built from a glycerol molecule, two fatty
acids, and a phosphate group. Because the fatty acids are nonpolar and the phosphate is polar, phospholipids are
amphipathic, meaning they have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.

Another class of lipids are steroids. Steroids are relatively flat, nonpolar molecules. Many steroids are formed by
modifying cholesterol molecules. Examples of steroids
