hat is the angle of
refraction 
in the glass; (b) what is the angle 
at which the ray emerges from
the glass?
APPROACH We apply Snell’s law twice: at the first surface, where the light enters
the glass, and again at the second surface where it leaves the glass and enters the air.
SOLUTION (a) The incident ray is in air, so
and
Applying
Snell’s law where the light enters the glass
gives
or
and
(b) Since the faces of the glass are parallel, the incident angle at the second surface
is also 
(geometry), so 
At this second interface,
and
Thus the ray re-enters the air at an angle 
given by
and 
The direction of a light ray is thus unchanged by passing
through a flat piece of glass of uniform thickness.
NOTE This result is valid for any angle of incidence. The ray is displaced slightly
to one side, however. You can observe this by looking through a piece of glass
(near its edge) at some object and then moving your head to the side slightly so
that you see the object directly. It “jumps.”
