ging from its molecular formula, would 
you expect cyclopropane to deviate more or less than Ar 
from ideal-gas behavior at moderately high pressures and 
room temperature? Explain. (c) Would cyclopropane ef-
fuse through a pinhole faster or more slowly than meth-
ane, CH4?

Consider the combustion reaction between 25.0 mL of 
liquid methanol 1density = 0.850 g>mL2 and 12.5 L of 
oxygen gas measured at STP
. The products of the reaction 
are CO21g2 and H2O1g2. Calculate the volume of liquid 
H2O formed if the reaction goes to completion and you 
condense the water vapor.

An herbicide is found to contain only C, H, N, and Cl. 
The complete combustion of a 100.0-mg sample of the 
herbicide in excess oxygen produces 83.16 mL of CO2 and 
73.30 mL of H2O vapor expressed at STP
. A separate anal-
ysis shows that the sample also contains 16.44 mg of Cl.
