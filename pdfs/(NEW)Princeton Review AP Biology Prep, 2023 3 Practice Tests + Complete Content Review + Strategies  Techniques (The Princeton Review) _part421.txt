 metabolism.
When animals have excess energy, they grow and store energy. When they are deficient, then they use up their
stores and lose mass and eventually die.
Body temperature is one way that animals must respond to their environment. Endotherms are animals that
generate their own body heat through metabolism. Ectotherms lack an internal mechanism to control body
temperature. Instead they regulate their temperature behaviorally by seeking out cool or warm places. One example
is a lizard on a warm rock.
BEHAVIOR
Some animals behave in a programmed way to specific stimuli, while others behave according to some type of
learning. We humans can do both. For the AP Biology Exam, you’ll have to know a little about these different types
of behavior—that is, how organisms cope with their environments.
Instinct
Instinct is an inborn, unlearned behavior. Sometimes the instinctive behavior is triggered by environmental signals
called releasers. The releaser is usually a small part of the envir
