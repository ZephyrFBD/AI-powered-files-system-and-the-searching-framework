The idea that electrons have wave properties led to the development of the
electron microscope (EM), which can produce images of much greater magnifi-
cation than a light microscope. Figures 27–14 and 27–15 are diagrams of two types,
developed around the middle of the twentieth century: the transmission electron
microscope (TEM), which produces a two-dimensional image, and the scanning
electron microscope (SEM), which produces images with a three-dimensional quality.

FIGURE 27–14 Transmission electron
microscope. The magnetic field coils
are designed to be “magnetic lenses,”
which bend the electron paths and
bring them to a focus, as shown. The
sensors of the image measure electron
intensity only, no color.
