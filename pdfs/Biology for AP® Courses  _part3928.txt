structural. The intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling. A single T cell will express thousands of identical
copies of one specific TCR variant on its cell surface. The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it
synthesizes millions of different T cell populations, each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain. This TCR

diversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of
T cells. The binding between an antigen-displaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR “match” indicates that the
adaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific T cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize
and destroy the invading pathogen.
