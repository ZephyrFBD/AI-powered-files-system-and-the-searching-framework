f a cell away from the cell wall due to the movement of water out of a cell. If a plant cell is placed in
an environment with a lower water potential than that of the cell, water will move from the higher water potential in
the cell to the lower water potential in its surroundings, and plasmolysis will occur. If a plant is placed in an
environment with a lower water potential (for example, if you forget to water your plant), plasmolysis will occur and
the plant will wilt.
In this part of the investigation, plant cells are placed in an environment with a lower water potential than that of
the plant cell and in an environment with a higher water potential than that of the plant cell. Observations of changes
in the cytoplasm are made under a light microscope.
Lab 5: Photosynthesis
Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic organisms capture light energy and store it in organic
compounds, which are consumed by other organisms. The overall equation for photosynthesis is the fol
