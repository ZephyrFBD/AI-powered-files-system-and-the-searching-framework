Combustion Analysis
One technique for determining empirical formulas in the laboratory is combustion analy-
sis, commonly used for compounds containing principally carbon and hydrogen.
When a compound containing carbon and hydrogen is completely combusted in 
an apparatus such as that shown in Figure 3.14, the carbon is converted to CO2 and the 
hydrogen is converted to H2O.  
(Section 3.2). From the
