n the matrix of the mitochondria. The inner membrane and the
intermembrane space—(A) and (C), respectively—are used in oxidative phosphorylation.
2.
D
Inhibitor Y is binding at a site outside the active site and is inducing a conformational change in the
enzyme structure. By binding outside the active site, it must be an allosteric inhibitor, eliminating (A) and
(C). Because the inhibitor is binding outside the active site, it is not competing with the substrate for
binding, so it is considered a noncompetitive inhibitor.

B
Enzymes are biological catalysts, which lower the activation energy (the energy threshold that must be
met to proceed from reactant to product). The reaction coordinate diagram must reflect a decrease in the
activation energy, eliminating (C). Furthermore, the enzyme does not alter the energy of the reactants or
products, eliminating (A) and (D).

Based on the pathway provided, consumption of one glucose and two ATP results in production of four
ATP. In other
