ide chains
are encoded by similar codons. This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might
either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being
rendered completely nonfunctional.

Question: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure 15.6) also have
approximately the same amount of DNA?
Background: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have
two copies of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and
the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6
