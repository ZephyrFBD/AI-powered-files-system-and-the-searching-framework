cs to the lungs
and out of the anterior air sacs. The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place
much more efficiently. This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where
the oxygen concentration is low. This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely
get the air out of the lungs.

Avian Respiration
Birds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. Flying is a high-energy process and
requires a lot of oxygen. Furthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen in
low. How did birds evolve a respiratory system that is so unique?
Decades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating
dinosaurs (Figure 30.14). In fact, fossil evidence shows that meat-eating dinosaurs that lived more than 100
million years ago had a similar flow-
