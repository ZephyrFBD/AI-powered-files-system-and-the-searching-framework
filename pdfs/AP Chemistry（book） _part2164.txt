nfants born with severe respiratory problems are some-
times given liquid ventilation: They breathe a liquid that 
can dissolve more oxygen than air can hold. One of these 
liquids is a fluorinated compound, CF3(CF2)7Br. The solu-
bility of oxygen in this liquid is 66 mL O2 per 100 mL liq-
uid. In contrast, air is 21% oxygen by volume. Calculate the 
moles of O2 present in an infant’s lungs (volume: 15 mL) 
if the infant takes a full breath of air compared to taking 
a full “breath” of a saturated solution of O2 in the fluori-
nated liquid. Assume a pressure of 1 atm in the lungs.

[13.107] At ordinary body temperature 137 °C2, the solubility of 
N2 in water at ordinary atmospheric pressure (1.0 atm) is 
0.015 g>L. Air is approximately 78 mol % N2. (a) Calculate 
the number of moles of N2 dissolved per liter of blood, as-
suming blood is a simple aqueous solution. (b) At a depth 
of 100 ft in water, the e
