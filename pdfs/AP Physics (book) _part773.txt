ion, car B moves forward at 
and car A is at rest. What
fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?
40. (II) A wooden block is cut into two pieces, one with three
times the mass of the other. A depression is made in both
faces of the cut, so that a firecracker can be placed in it with
the block reassembled. The reassembled block is set on a
rough-surfaced table, and the fuse is lit. When the firecracker
explodes inside, the two blocks separate and slide apart.
What is the ratio of distances each block travels?
41. (II) A 144-g baseball moving 
strikes a stationary
5.25-kg brick resting on small rollers so it moves without
significant friction. After hitting the brick, the baseball
bounces straight back, and the brick moves forward at
