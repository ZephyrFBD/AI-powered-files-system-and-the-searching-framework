Connection for AP速 Courses
By using mathematics, ecologists can study how interactions among living organisms and with their environment affect
the distribution, abundance, density, and life strategies of species. A population consists of individuals of the same species
living within a specific area. Populations fluctuate based on both biotic and abiotic factors. When studying a population,
characteristics of that population are quantified and their change is monitored. This statistical study of these changes,
demography, investigates how populations respond to these fluctuations. A shift in populations can affect community
structure and the ecosystem as a whole.
