 a 3.0-V port-
able CD player that draws a maximum of 240 mA of current?
28. (I) The heating element of an electric oven is designed to
produce 3.3 kW of heat when connected to a 240-V source.
What must be the resistance of the element?
29. (I) What is the maximum voltage that can be applied across
a 
resistor rated at
watt?
30. (I) (a) Determine the resistance of, and current through,
a 75-W lightbulb connected to its proper source voltage of
110 V. (b) Repeat for a 250-W bulb.

19. (II) A rectangular solid made of carbon has sides of lengths
1.0 cm, 2.0 cm, and 4.0 cm, lying
along the x, y, and z axes,
respectively (Fig. 18–35).
Determine the resistance for
current that passes through
the solid in (a) the x direc-
tion, (b) the y direction,
and (c) the z direction.
Assume the resistivity is
r = 3.0 * 10–5 m.
41. (II) How many 75-W lightbulbs, connected to 120 V as in
Fig. 18–20, can be used without blowing a 15-A fuse?
