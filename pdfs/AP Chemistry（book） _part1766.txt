 the external pressure.
Plan We need to convert 0.80 atm to torr because that is the 
pressure scale on the graph. We estimate the location of that 
pressure on the graph, move horizontally to the vapor–pressure 
curve, and then drop vertically from the curve to estimate the 
temperature.

11.6 ∣ Phase Diagrams
The equilibrium between a liquid and its vapor is not the only dynamic equilibrium 
that can exist between states of matter. Under appropriate conditions, a solid can be 
in equilibrium with its liquid or even with its vapor. The temperature at which solid 
and liquid phases coexist at equilibrium is the melting point of the solid or the freezing 
point of the liquid. Solids can also undergo evaporation and therefore possess a vapor 
pressure.
A phase diagram is a graphic way to summarize the conditions under which equi-
libria exist between the different states of matter. Such a diagram also allows us to predict 
which
