ke that of an atom, is not a clearly defined quantity since
the edges are not distinct like those of a tennis ball or baseball, we can nonethe-
less define a cross section for nuclei undergoing collisions by using an analogy.
Suppose that projectile particles strike a stationary target of total area A and
thickness 
as shown in Fig. 31–2. Assume also that the target is made up of
identical objects (such as marbles or nuclei), each of which has a cross-sectional
area 
and we assume the incoming projectiles are small by comparison. We
assume that the target objects are fairly far apart and the thickness is so small
that we don’t have to worry about overlapping. This is often a reasonable
assumption because nuclei have diameters on the order of 
but are at least
(atomic size) apart even in solids. If there are n nuclei per unit volume,
the total cross-sectional area of all these tiny targets is
since
is the total number of targets and 
is the cross-
sectional area of each. If
