diffraction analysis of DNA (from Rosalind Franklin). However, the fact
that much of the components of DNA were known before Watson and
Crick began their model building does not detract from the brilliance of
their achievement. Understanding the structure of DNA gives a foundation
to understand how DNA could replicate itself. Watson and Crick received

the Nobel prize in 1962 for correctly describing the structure of DNA.
Meselson and Stahl (1958) proved that DNA replicates in a
semiconservative fashion, as Francis Crick predicted. They cultured
bacteria in a medium containing heavy nitrogen (15N), allowing the
bacteria to incorporate this heavy nitrogen into their DNA as they
replicated and divided. These bacteria were then transferred to a medium
containing light nitrogen (14N) and allowed to replicate and divide only
once. The bacteria that resulted from this final replication were spun in a
centrifuge and found to be midway in den
