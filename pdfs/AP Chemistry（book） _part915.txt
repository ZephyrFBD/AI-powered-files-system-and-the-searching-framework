propriate conditions, behave as though it were a stream of particles 
(photons), could matter, under appropriate conditions, possibly show the properties 
of a wave?
De Broglie suggested that an electron moving about the nucleus of an atom behaves 
like a wave and therefore has a wavelength. He proposed that the wavelength of the elec-
tron, or of any other particle, depends on its mass, m, and on its velocity, v:
 
l =
h
mv 
[6.8]
where h is the Planck constant. The quantity mv for any object is called its momentum. 
De Broglie used the term matter waves to describe the wave characteristics of material 
particles.
Check Referring back to Figure 6.12, we confirm that the n = 4 to 
n = 1 transition should have the largest energy of the three possi-
ble transitions.

In the top part of Figure 6.11, the four lines in the H atom 
spectrum are due to transitions from a level for which ni 7 2 
to the nf = 2 level. What is the value of ni for the red line in the
