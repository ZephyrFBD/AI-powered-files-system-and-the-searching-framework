sponse. T cells are a key component in the cell-mediated response—the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to
neutralize cells that have been infected with viruses and certain bacteria. There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper,
and suppressor T cells. Cytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T
cells play a part in activating both the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor T cells deactivate T
cells and B cells when needed, and thus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.
An antigen is a foreign or “non-self” macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. Not all antigens will
provoke a response. For instance, individuals produce innumerable “self” antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless
foreign antigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. The suppression of immune responses to harmless
macromolecules is highly regulated and typically preven
