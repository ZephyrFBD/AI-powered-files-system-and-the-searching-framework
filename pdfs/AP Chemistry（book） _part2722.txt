logous curve of pH versus added acid. In this case, how-
ever, the pH is high at the outset of the titration and low at its comple-
tion (Figure 17.8). The pH at the equivalence point is still 7.0 (at 25 °C), 
 
just like the strong acid–strong base titration.

Give It Some Thought
What is the pH at the equivalence point when 0.10 M HNO3 is used 
to titrate a volume of solution containing 0.30 g of KOH?
Weak Acid–Strong Base Titrations
The curve for titration of a weak acid by a strong base is similar to the 
curve in Figure 17.7. Consider, for example, the curve for titration of 
50.0 mL of 0.100 M acetic acid with 0.100 M NaOH shown in Figure 17.9. 
We can calculate the pH at points along this curve, using principles 
we discussed earl
