Would you expect NiO to dissolve in an aqueous solution of NaNO3?
Because of their relatively large, negative electron affinities, nonmetals tend to gain elec-
trons when they react with metals. For example, the reaction of aluminum with bromine 
produces the ionic compound aluminum bromide:
 
2 Al1s2 + 3 Br21l2 ยก 2 AlBr31s2 
[7.12]
A nonmetal will typically gain enough electrons to fill its outermost occupied p sub-
shell, giving a noble-gas electron configuration. For example, the bromine atom gains 
one electron to fill its 4p subshell:
Br13Ar44s23d104p52 + e- 1 Br-13Ar44s23d104p62
Compounds composed entirely of nonmetals are typically molecular substances that tend 
to be gases, liquids, or low melting point solids at room temperature. Examples include 
the common hydrocarbons we use for fuel (methane, CH4; propane, C3H8; octane, 
C8H18) and the gases HCl, NH3, and H2S. Many pharmaceuticals are molecules
