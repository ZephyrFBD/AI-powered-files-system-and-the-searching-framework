 21.67  Hydroxyl radicals can pluck hydrogen atoms from mole-
cules (“hydrogen abstraction”), and hydroxide ions can 
pluck protons from molecules (“deprotonation”). Write 
the reaction equations and Lewis dot structures for the 
hydrogen abstraction and deprotonation reactions for the 
generic carboxylic acid R¬COOH with hydroxyl radical 
and hydroxide ion, respectively. Why is hydroxyl radical 
more toxic to living systems than hydroxide ion?
