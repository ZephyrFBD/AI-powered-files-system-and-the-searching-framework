7–6 Inelastic Collisions
Collisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are called inelastic collisions.
Some of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other types of energy, such
as thermal or potential energy, so the total kinetic energy after the collision is less
than the total kinetic energy before the collision. The inverse can also happen
when potential energy (such as chemical or nuclear) is released, in which case the
total kinetic energy after the interaction can be greater than the initial kinetic
energy. Explosions are examples of this type.
Typical macroscopic collisions are inelastic, at least to some extent, and often to
a large extent. If two objects stick together as a result of a collision, the collision
is said to be completely inelastic. Two colliding balls of putty th
