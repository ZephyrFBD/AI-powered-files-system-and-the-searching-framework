charges” that each particle has. Each
fundamental particle can thus have electric charge, weak charge, color charge, and
gravitational mass, although one or more of these could be zero. For example, all
leptons have color charge of zero, so they do not interact via the strong force.

Beta decay. Draw a Feynman diagram,
showing what happens in beta decay using quarks.
RESPONSE Beta decay is a result of the weak interaction, and the mediator is
either a 
or 
particle. What happens, in part, is that a neutron (udd quarks)
decays into a proton (uud). Apparently a d quark (charge 
) has turned 
into a u quark (charge 
). Charge conservation means that a negatively
charged particle, namely a 
was emitted by the d quark. Since an electron
and an antineutrino appear in the final state, they must have come from the
decay of the virtual 
as shown in Fig. 32–18.
To summarize, the Standard Model says that the truly fundamental particles
