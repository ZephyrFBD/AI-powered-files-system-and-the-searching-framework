ions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH– rapidly when placed in
water, thereby raising the pH. An example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a pH near 8.0, close enough to
neutral pH that marine organisms adapted to this saline environment are able to thrive in it.
The pH scale is, as previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 (Figure 2.20). Anything below 7.0
(ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. Extremes in pH in either direction
from 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life. The pH inside cells (6.8) and the pH in the blood (7.4) are both very
close to neutral. However, the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a pH of 1 to 2. So how do t
