 process)
integral protein and pigment complex in thylakoid membranes that transports electrons from water to the
electron transport chain; oxygen is a product of PSII
molecule that is capable of absorbing certain wavelengths of light and reflecting others (which accounts for its
color)
pigment or other organic molecule in the reaction center that accepts an energized electron
from the reaction center
complex of chlorophyll molecules and other organic molecules that is assembled around a special pair of
chlorophyll molecules and a primary electron acceptor; capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction
gain of electron(s) by an atom or molecule
instrument that can measure transmitted light and compute the absorption
opening that regulates gas exchange and water evaporation between leaves and the environment, typically situated
on the underside of leaves
fluid-filled space surrounding the grana inside a chloroplast where the light-independent reactions of
photosynthesis take place
