thymine, which codes for valine
rather than the normal glutamic acid in the hemoglobin protein. Further evidence that
this is a base-pair substitution includes that the mutation involves a single codon and
that the protein is still produced, but with one diﬀerent amino acid. (A) is thus correct.
Usually frameshiȇ mutations will have a much greater eﬀect on the resulting protein, so
(B) is unlikely. (C) is incorrect because silent mutations have no eﬀect on the protein, due
to the redundancy in the genetic code. Mutagens are agents that cause mutations, so (D)
is also incorrect.

If malaria were eliminated, selection for the sickle cell allele would cease. Individuals
with the allele would no longer have a greater chance of survival than those without it. At
the same time, in this scenario, homozygous individuals would receive treatment that
would ensure their survival through reproductive age and beyond. Thus, the allele would
not be selected against either. With no selective pres
