gives 0.77. Since p + q must equal 1 (there are only two alleles and their
frequencies must total 1), the population cannot be in equilibrium. This can be caused by the nonrandom nature of a
test cross, as a population in equilibrium must be mating randomly.
7. A. The maintenance of various patterned shells in the snail population is an example of a balanced polymorphism.
It may be (and there is good evidence that it is) maintained by natural selection, genetic drift (chance), mutations,
and other factors as well. Convergent evolution does not apply here because it refers to two or more species not of
common ancestral origin that share similar traits. This question deals with phenotypic variation within a single
species.
8. B. Structures in different species are homologous because they have been inherited from a common ancestor.
Insects (butterflies) are not closely related to the other listed animals. Mammals (including bats) and birds (birds and
penguins) are related by descent from
