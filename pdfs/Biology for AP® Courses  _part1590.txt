stop the
replication or reading of that strand. Substitution
mutations can cause a frame shift. This can
result in non-functional proteins.
d.
Mutations can cause a single change in amino
acid. A nonsense mutation can stop the
replication or reading of that strand. Insertion or
deletion mutations can cause a frame shift. This
can result in functional proteins.
53. Discuss the significance of mutations in tRNA and
rRNA.
a.
Mutations in tRNA and rRNA would lead to the
production of defective proteins or no protein
production.
b.
Mutations in tRNA and rRNA would lead to
changes in the semi-conservative mode of
replication of DNA.
c.
Mutations in tRNA and rRNA would lead to
production of a DNA strand with a mutated
single strand and normal other strand.
d.
Mutations in tRNA and rRNA would lead to
skin cancer in patients of xeroderma pigmentosa.
