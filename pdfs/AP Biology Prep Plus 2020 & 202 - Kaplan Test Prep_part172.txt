There are two main classes of acetylcholine receptors: nicotinic and
muscarinic. Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels while
muscarinic receptors function as G protein-coupled receptors and exert
their eﬀects through a second messenger system.
7. In order to propagate an action potential, neurons utilize diﬀerent
types of transport mechanisms. Which of the following correctly
link the type of transport used to its function?
Simple diﬀusion occurs when sodium ions flow through leak
channels in the cell membrane.
I.
Facilitated diﬀusion occurs when acetylcholine binds to a
nicotinic receptor to open an ion channel, allowing sodium to
enter the cell.
II.
The sodium/potassium pump utilizes passive transport to draw
potassium into the cell and push sodium out of it.

produce increasingly less acetylcholine as the disease progresses.
