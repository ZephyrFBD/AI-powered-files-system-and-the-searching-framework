Based on the table, which of the following conclusions is most
plausible?Â 
The cecum can become a vestigial structure in meat eaters,
since it is shorter in species 2 and 3 than in species 1 and 4.
(A)
The cecum evolved to have an important role in the digestion
of protein, since it is shorter in species 2 and 3 than in species
1 and 4.
(B)
Species 1 is more closely related to species 4 than to species
2, because 1 and 4 are both herbivores.
(C)
Species 2 and 3 have a recent common ancestor, since the
average cecum lengths in species 2 and 3 are approximately
equal.
(D)

Sickle cell anemia is caused by mutant hemoglobin DNA, which is
more common in humans with African ancestry than in those with
European ancestry. The sickle cell allele cre
