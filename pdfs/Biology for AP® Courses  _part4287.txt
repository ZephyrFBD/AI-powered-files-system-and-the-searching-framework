39. Ecologists often collaborate with other researchers
interested in ecological questions. Describe the levels of
ecology that would be easier for collaboration because of
the similarities of questions asked. What levels of ecology
might be more difficult for collaboration?
a.
It is easier to study community and ecosystem
ecology as the effect of biotic and abiotic factors
can be studied in a community or ecosystem
more easily. Organismal and population ecology
might be more difficult for collaboration.
b.
It is easier to study organismal and population
ecology as the effect of biotic and abiotic factors
can be studied in an organism or population
more easily. Community and ecosystem ecology
might be more difficult for collaboration.
c.
It is easier to study community and population
ecology as the effect of biotic
