should be able to demonstrate understanding 
of the following concepts. The concepts may be scaffolded according to level of skills and 
conceptual understanding. 
•  Basic protein structure 
•  The concept of induced fit 
•  The role of enzymes 
•  That structure, function, and environment are all required for maximal function of 
enzymatic reactions 
■ Skills Development 
Students will develop/reinforce the following skills: 
•  Using pipettes to measure solutions 
•  Using pH indicators to determine environmental conditions that may influence the 
reaction activity of enzymes 
■ Potential Challenges 
One challenge for students is coordinating the timing of the enzymatic reaction(s) and 
collecting data. Instruct students that as soon as they combine the contents of the test 
tube with substrate and the test tube with enzyme, they must immediately begin timing 
the reaction. 
The key to having excellent results is measuring the amount of each solution as 
accurately as possible. Chec
