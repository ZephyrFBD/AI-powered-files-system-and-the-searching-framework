ope photograph of the so-called “Einstein cross,” thought to represent
“gravitational lensing”: the central spot is a relatively nearby galaxy, whereas the four other spots are thought to be
images of a single quasar behind the galaxy. (b) Diagram showing how the galaxy could bend the light coming from the
quasar behind it to produce the four images. See also Fig. 33–14. [If the shape of the nearby galaxy and distant quasar
were perfect spheres and perfectly aligned, we would expect the “image” of the distant quasar to be a circular ring or
halo instead of the four separate images seen here. Such a ring is called an “Einstein ring.”]

An opportune eclipse occurred in 1919, and scientists journeyed to the South
Atlantic to observe it. Their photos of stars just behind the Sun revealed shifts in
accordance with Einstein’s prediction. Another example of gravitational deflection
of light is gravitational lensing,
