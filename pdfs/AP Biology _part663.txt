he muscle fiber (cell). Its
boundaries are the Z lines, which give skeletal muscle its
characteristic striated appearance.
The Sliding Filament Theory
Within the cytoplasm of each muscle cell are thousands of fibers called
myofibrils that run parallel to the length of the cell. Myofibrils consist of
thick and thin filaments. Each thin filament consists of two strands of
actin proteins wound around one another. Each thick filament is
composed of two long chains of myosin molecules each with a globular
head at one end. The contraction of the sarcomere depends on two other
molecules, troponin and tropomyosin, in addition to Ca++ ions, to form
and break cross-bridges. Muscle contracts as thick and thin filaments slide
over each other.
The Neuromuscular Junction
The axon of a motor neuron synapses on a skeletal muscle at the
neuromuscular junction. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, released by
