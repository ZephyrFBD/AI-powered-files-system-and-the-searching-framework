 and not those of the ancestral species.
The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called
an allopolyploid. The prefix “allo-” means “other” (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes
from two different species combine. Figure 18.18 illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form. Notice how it
takes two generations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results.
Figure 18.18 Alloploidy results when two species mate to produce viable offspring. In the example shown, a normal
gamete from one species fuses with a polyploidy gamete from another. Two matings are necessary to produce viable
offspring.
The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally
in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations described
here are unlikely to s
