ctric field is toward the charge Q, to the left as shown in
Fig. 16–26a, since we defined the direction as that of the force on a positive test
charge which here would be attractive. If Q had been positive, the electric field
would have pointed away, as in Fig. 16–26b.
NOTE There is no electric charge at point P. But there is an electric field there.
The only real charge is Q.

EXAMPLE 16;7
The electric field at any point in space can be measured, based on the definition,
Eq.16–3. For simple situations with one or several point charges, we can calculate 
For example, the electric field at a distance r from a single point charge Q would
have magnitude
[single point charge] (16;4a)
or, in terms of 
as in Eq. 16–2
[single point charge] (16;4b)
Notice that E is independent of the test charge q—that is, E depends only on the
charge Q which produces the field, and not on the value of the test charge q
