d pressure is a bit more than 1 atm, which is 
about 101 kPa. This makes sense because we anticipated that the 
pressure in the flask would be greater than the atmospheric  
pressure 1764.7 torr = 1.01 atm2 acting on the manometer.
Solve
(a) The pressure of the gas equals the atmospheric pressure plus h:
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If the gas inside the flask in the above exercise is cooled so 
that its pressure is reduced to a value of 715.7 torr, what will 
be the height of the mercury in the open-ended arm? 
(Hint: The sum of the heights in both arms must remain 
constant regardless of the change in pressure.)  
(a) 49.0 mm (b) 95.6 mm (c) 144.6 mm (d) 120.1 mm
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
If the pressure of the gas inside the flask were increased and 
the height of the column in the open-ended arm went up 
by 5.0 mm, what would be the new pressure of the gas in 
the flask, in torr?
Plan We will use the difference in height between the two arms  
1h in Figure 10.32 to obtain the amount by whic
