3d antibonding MOs. (c) With reference to 
the “Closer Look” box on the phases of orbitals, explain why 
a node is generated in the s*
3d MO. (d) Sketch the energy- 
level diagram for the Sc2 molecule, assuming that only the 
3d orbital from part (a) is important. (e) What is the bond 
order in Sc2?
 
[9.120]  The organic molecules shown here are derivatives of ben-
zene in which six-membered rings are “fused” at the edges 
of the hexagons.
