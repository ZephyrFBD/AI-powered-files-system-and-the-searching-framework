 organisms, and many laboratory investigations that model the process are 
either computer-based or structured simulations. 
 Investigation 1: Artificial Selection  provides an alternative for 
students to investigate artificial selection. Just as Darwin relied on artificial selection in 
domesticated farm animals to make his case in On the Origin of Species, students explore 
possible advantages or disadvantages that selected traits might confer on individuals 
in different environmental conditions. Because artificial selection experiments require 
a relatively large population with ample phenotypic variation, the first step of the 
investigation is conducted at the class level, and begins with questions that center on 
artificial selection in agricultural crops and well-known examples of natural selection 
and evolution, such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria (big idea 3). Once students 
identify the common features of these events (selection, rapid changes in populations, 
and ge
