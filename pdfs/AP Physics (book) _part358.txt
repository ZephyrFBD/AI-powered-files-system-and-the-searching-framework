Forces on the assistant are
shown as red (magenta) arrows.
Forces on the sled are purple arrows.
Forces acting on the ground are
orange arrows. Action–reaction
forces that are equal and opposite
are labeled by the same subscripts
but reversed (such as 
and 
)
and are of different colors because
they act on different objects.

4–6 Weight—the Force of Gravity;
and the Normal Force
As we saw in Chapter 2, Galileo claimed that all objects dropped near the surface
of the Earth would fall with the same acceleration,
if air resistance was negligible.
The force that causes this acceleration is called the force of gravity or gravitational
force. What exerts the gravitational force on an object? It is the Earth, as we will
discuss in Chapter 5, and the force acts vertically† downward, toward the center of
the Earth. Let us apply Newto
