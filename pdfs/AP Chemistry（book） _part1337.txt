h of these compounds is an exception to the oc-
tet rule: carbon dioxide, water, ammonia, phosphorus 
trifluoride, or arsenic pentafluoride? (b) Which of these 
compounds or ions is an exception to the octet rule: bo-
rohydride (BH4
-), borazine (B3N3H6, which is analogous 
to benzene with alternating B and N in the ring), or boron 
trichloride?
 8.60 Fill in the blank with the appropriate numbers for both 
electrons and bonds (considering that single bonds are 
counted as one, double bonds as two, and triple bonds as 
three).
(a) Fluorine has 
 valence electrons and makes 
 
bond(s) in compounds.
(b) Oxygen has 
 valence electrons and makes 
 
bond(s) in compounds.
(c) Nitrogen has 
 valence electrons and makes 
 
bond(s) in compounds.
(d) Carbon has 
 valence electrons and makes 
 
bond(s) in compounds.

Which of these do not obey the octet rule?
