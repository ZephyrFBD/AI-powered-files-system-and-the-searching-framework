CHAPTER SUMMARY
24.1 Animal Form and Function
Animal bodies come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Limits on animal size and shape include impacts to their movement.
Diffusion affects their size and development. Bioenergetics describes how animals use and obtain energy in relation to
their body size, activity
