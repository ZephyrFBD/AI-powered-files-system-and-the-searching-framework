miliar water molecule, H2O, consists of two hydrogen atoms and
one oxygen atom; these bond together to form water, as illustrated in Figure 2.9. Atoms can form molecules by donating,
accepting, or sharing electrons to fill their outer shells.

Figure 2.9 Two or more atoms may bond with each other to form a molecule. When two hydrogens and an oxygen
share electrons via covalent bonds, a water molecule is formed.
Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken
apart. The substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants (usually found on the left side
of a chemical equation), and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products (usually found
on the right side of a chemical equation). An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the
direction of the chemical reaction; this direction is not alway
