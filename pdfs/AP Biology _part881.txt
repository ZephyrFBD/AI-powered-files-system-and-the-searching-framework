SHORT FREE-RESPONSE QUESTION
(Note: This question is worth 4 points total.)
In a population of royal flycatchers in Costa Rica, the allele for a large
crown on the head (C) is dominant over the allele for a small crown on the
head (c). It has been determined that, for this population, the percentage of
royal flycatchers with small crowns has remained at 11% since 1850
(when the population was first studied).
Describe one process that is responsible for the maintenance of
the unchanged frequency of small-crowned alleles in this
population of royal flycatchers. (1 point)
Explain the standard by which scientists determine which
individual is the fittest in any population. (1 point)
Predict what would occur in this population if the royal
flycatchers, that were born to a mating couple over several years,
experienced a mutation and were all born with a very different
