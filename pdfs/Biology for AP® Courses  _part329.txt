addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Conserved through evolution in all organisms, nucleic acids store and
transmit hereditary information. As will be explored in more detail in Chapters 14-17, DNA contains the instructions for the
synthesis of proteins by dictating the sequences of amino acids in polypeptides through processes known as transcription
and translation. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides; in turn, each nucleotide consists of a pentose sugar (de
