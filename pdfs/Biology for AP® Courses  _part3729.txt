m and vasoconstriction of other vessels. During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through
vasodilation while blood to the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction. The blood entering some
capillary beds is controlled by small muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated in Figure 31.18. If the sphincters
are open, the blood will flow into the associated branches of the capillary blood. If all of the sphincters are closed, then the
blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel (see Figure 31.18). These muscles
allow the body to precisely control when capillary beds receive blood flow. At any given moment only about 5-10% of our
capillary beds actually have blood flowing through them.
Figure 31.18 (a) Precapillary sphincters are rings of smooth muscle that regulate the flow of blood through
capillaries; they help control the location of blood flow to where it is needed. (b) Valves in the veins preve
