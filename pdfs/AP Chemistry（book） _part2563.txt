 pH 7 7?
Calculate the pH of a 0.20 M solution of HCN. (Refer to Table 16.2 or Appendix D for the value of Ka.)
Sample Exercise 16.12 
Using Ka to Calculate pH
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the molarity of a weak acid and are asked for 
the pH. From Table 16.2, Ka for HCN is 4.9 * 10-10.
Plan We proceed as in the example just worked in the text, writing 
the chemical equation and constructing a table of initial and equi-
librium concentrations in which the equilibrium concentration of 
H+ is our unknown.
Solve Writing both the chemical equation for the ionization reac-
tion that forms H+1aq2 and the equilibrium-constant 1Ka2 expres-
sion for the reaction:
HCN1aq2 ∆ H +1aq2 + CN-1aq2
Ka =
3H+43CN-4
3HCN4
= 4.9 * 10-10
Next, we tabulate the concentrations of the species involved in 
the equilibrium reaction, letting x = 3H+4 at equilibrium:
HCN1aq2   ∆    H+1aq2     +       
CN-1aq2
