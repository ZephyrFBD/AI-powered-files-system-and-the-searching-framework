the molecules. This effect is called surface tension. More specifically, a quantity
called the surface tension,
(the Greek letter gamma), is defined as the force F
per unit length 
that acts perpendicular to any line or cut in a liquid surface,
tending to pull the surface closed:
(10;10)
To understand this, consider the 
apparatus shown in Fig.10–34 which
encloses a thin film of liquid (such as a liquid soap film). Because of surface tension,
a force F is required to pull the movable wire and thus increase the surface area of
the liquid. The liquid contained by the wire apparatus is a thin film having both a
top and a bottom surface. Hence the total length of the surface being increased is 
and the surface tension is
A delicate apparatus of this type can be used
to measure the surface tension of various liquids. The surface tension of water is
at 20°C. Table 10–4 (next page) gives the values for several substances.
Note that temperature has a considerable effect on the surface tensi
