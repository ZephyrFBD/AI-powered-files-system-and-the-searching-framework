onditions. Camouflage in both mottled and
solid snails is best during optimum
environmental conditions and does not change

b.
A possible hypothesis is that the coloration of
the snail is an adaptation in the form of

c.
A possible hypothesis is that the coloration of
the snail is an adaptation in the form of
camouflage to protect the snail from predators in
its native region. Mottled snails are best
camouflaged in their native region and stand out
to predators and suffer greater predation when
placed in the region normally occupied by solid
snails.
