This doesn’t mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships
of life. A consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that Darwin’s original conception of the
phylogenetic tree is too simple, but made sense based on what was known at the time. However, the search for a more
useful model moves on: each model serving as hypotheses to be tested with the possibility of developing new models. This
is how science advances. These models are used as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships
and understand the massive amount of data being analyzed.
