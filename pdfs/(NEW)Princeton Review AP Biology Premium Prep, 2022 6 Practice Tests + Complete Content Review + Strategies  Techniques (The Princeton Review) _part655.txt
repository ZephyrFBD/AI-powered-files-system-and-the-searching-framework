t makes an observational study different from a study inside a lab
environment. (3 points)
The independent variable would be the number of offspring in a brood; the scientist would count how many survive
from each brood size. In an observational study, it is difficult to control anything other than the independent variable.
Maybe the nests being studied are in slightly different environments. Maybe the parents of different broods are better
than others. There is a lot that might be different between groups in an observational study. In a lab study, variables
are more easily controlled, but this is an artificial setup that doesnâ€™t quite mimic the natural environment.
c. Describe the brood size(s) in which 100% of the offspring survive. Identify which brood size has the highest
percent of mortality. (2 points)
For a brood size of 3, it shows that 3 offspring survive, so 100%. For a brood size of 13, only 8 survive. 8/13 is the
least surviving percentage, so a brood size of 13 has the hig
