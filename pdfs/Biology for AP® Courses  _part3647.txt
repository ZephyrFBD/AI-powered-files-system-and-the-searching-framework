ical dead space is a region of lung
tissue that is not receiving electrical stimulation
from the nervous system. It could be caused by a
reduction in neurotransmitters.
c.
A physiological dead space is a region of lung
tissue that is not involved in gas exchange
because the tissue is not functioning properly. It
could be caused by the alveoli capillaries are not
receiving blood flow.
d.
A physiological dead space is a region of lung
tissue that is not involved in gas exchange
because the tissue has a defect in its structure. It
could be caused by a genetic condition.
14. How will the respiratory rate and volume of air per
breath change if alveolar ventilation is too high or too
low?
a.
If ventilation is low, the respiratory rate will
decrease while the volume of air per breath is
decreased. If ventilation is high, the respiratory
rate will increase while the volume of air per
breath decreases.
b.
If ventilation is low, the respiratory rate will
decrease while the volume of air per brea
