 apparent position
of the “nearby” star relative to more distant stars, at
two different times (January and July). The viewing
angle in January puts the star more to the right relative
to distant stars, whereas in July it is more to the left
(dashed circle shows January location).

Astrophysics and Cosmology
Distance to a star using parallax. Estimate
the distance D to a star if the angle 
in Fig. 33–11a is measured to be
APPROACH From trigonometry,
in Fig. 33–11a. The Sun–Earth
distance is 
(inside front cover).
SOLUTION The angle 
or about 
radians. We can use tan
because 
is very small. We solve 
for D in tan
The distance D to the star is
or about 15 ly.
Parsec
Distances to stars are often specified in terms of parallax angle (
in Fig. 33–11a)
given in seconds of arc: 1 second 
is 
of one minute 
of arc, which is 
of
a degree, so 
of a degree. The distance is then specified in parsecs (pc)
(meaning parallax angle in seconds of arc):
