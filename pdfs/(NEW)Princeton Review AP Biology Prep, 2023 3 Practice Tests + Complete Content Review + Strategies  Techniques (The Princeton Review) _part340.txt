NA version of a DNA recipe that gets sent to the ribosome.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is produced in the nucleolus, makes up part of the ribosomes. You’ll recall
from our discussion of the cell in Chapter 5 that the ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. We’ll see how
they function a little later on.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) shuttles amino acids to the ribosomes. It is responsible for bringing the appropriate
amino acids into place at the appropriate time by matching anticodons to codons. It does this by reading the
message carried by the mRNA.
Think Critically
Can you think of any exceptions to the Central Dogma? Do all genes get
turned into RNA and then into proteins?
Hint: rRNA, tRNA, and RNAi never get turned into protein; they stay as RNA.
There is also another class of RNA, called interfering RNAs, or RNAi. These are small snippets of RNA that are
naturally made in the body or intentionally created by humans. These interfering RNAs, called siRNA and miRNA,
can bind to specific
