to justify the reasoning for 
their predictions.
Preparing for the AP Exam 
The principle of natural selection and its 
components appears throughout the course. 
It is important that students are precise in 
the language they use when writing about 
evolution, being careful to avoid writing 
statements that are Lamarckian. A common 
student error is using buzzwords such as 
“fitness” without proper explanation of 
the underlying concept. Students should 
recall the sources of genetic variation 
learned in Unit 5 in order to demonstrate 
the understanding that genetic variation is 
necessary for natural selection and describe 
its role in reproductive success. In their 
writing, students should be clear that while 
natural selection acts on individuals, it is 
populations that evolve. Another common 
error on the exam is that students do not 
clearly differentiate the types of reproductive 
isolating mechanisms that lead to speciation.
