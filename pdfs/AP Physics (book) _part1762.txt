t charges. Calculate the total electric
field at point A in Fig. 16–28 due to both charges,
and 
APPROACH The calculation is much like that of Example 16–4, except now 
we are dealing with electric fields instead of force. The electric field at point A 
is the vector sum of the fields 
due to 
and 
due to 
We find the
magnitude of the field produced by each point charge, then we add their 
components to find the total field at point A.
SOLUTION The magnitude of the electric field produced at point A by each of
the charges 
and 
is given by
so
The direction of 
points from A toward 
(negative charge), whereas 
points from A away from 
as shown; so the total electric field at A,
has
components
Thus the magnitude of 
is
and its direction is 
(Fig. 16–28) given by
so f = 76°.
