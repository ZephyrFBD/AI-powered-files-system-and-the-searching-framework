concentration of auxin in the shady side of the stem causes differential growth; that is, since auxin
generates growth by stimulating elongation, the shady side grows more than the sunny side. When the shady side
grows more than the sunny side, the stem bends toward the light.
2. Gravitropism, the response to gravity by stems and roots, is not well understood. Amyloplasts, specialized,
starch-containing, cell organelles, sink to the bottom of cells in response to gravity, and, thus, may be associated
with the detection of a gravitational field. In general, auxin is involved, but its action depends on its relative
concentration and the target organ (root or stem). The role of auxin appears to agree with the following:
If a stem is horizontal, auxin produced at the apical meristem moves down the stem and concentrates on its lower
side. Since auxin stimulates cell elongation, growth of the lower side is greater than that of the upper side, and the
stem bends upward as it grows.
If a root
