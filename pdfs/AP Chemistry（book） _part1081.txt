ionic radii can be determined from interatomic distances in ionic compounds. Like the 
Natural gas used in home heating and cooking is odorless. Because natural gas 
leaks pose the danger of explosion or suffocation, various smelly substances 
are added to the gas to allow detection of a leak. One such substance is methyl 
mercaptan, CH3SH. Use Figure 7.7 to predict the lengths of the C¬ S, C¬ H, 
and S¬ H bonds in this molecule.
Sample Exercise 7.1 
Bond Lengths in a Molecule
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We are given three bonds and told to use 
Figure 7.7 for bonding atomic radii. We will assume that each 
bond length is the sum of the bonding atomic radii of the two 
atoms involved.
Solve
    C ¬S bond length = bonding atomic radius of C
 
 
 
+ bonding atomic radius of S 
  = 0.76 A
° + 1.05 A
° = 1.81 A
°    
  C ¬ H bond length = 0.76 A
° + 0.31 A
° = 1.07 A
°   
   S ¬H bond length = 1.05 A
° + 0.31 A
° = 1.36 A

Check The experimentally determined bond lengths are 
C¬S = 1.
