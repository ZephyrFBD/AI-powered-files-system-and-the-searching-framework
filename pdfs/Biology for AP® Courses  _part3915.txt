longer than the innate response—and
is more specific to pathogens and involves molecular memory. This type of immunity occurs after we’ve been exposed to
an antigen either from a pathogen or through vaccination and is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient
to control the infection. There are two types of adaptive responses: cell-mediated immune response, carried out by T cells,
and the humoral immune response, controlled by activated B cells and their production of antibodies. Adaptive immunity
involves memory so that re-exposure to the same pathogen will elicit an efficient and quick response. This gives long-term
protection from reinfection.
The information in this section will seem overwhelmingly complex with its discussion of antigens, antigen-presenting cells,
major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules, different types of T cells, antibody-secreting B cells, and the programming of
memory cells. One suggestion is to read the information slowly, study the figures an
