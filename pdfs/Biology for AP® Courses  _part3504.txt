due to interactions of the constituent parts.
Muscle cells are specialized for contraction. Muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily
processes such as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle,
and smooth muscle (Figure 29.33).
Figure 29.33 The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle,
visualized here using light microscopy. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one plump
nucleus in each. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and striated, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, a
