Increasing the light intensity will cause the plants to engage in
additional photosynthesis, increasing their biomass. This, in turn, will
cause increases in the biomass of the caterpillars and birds. (D) is thus
correct. (A) is incorrect because trophic pyramids are only very rarely
inverted. (B) is incorrect because the other two levels would also
increase in biomass. (C) is incorrect because all the levels would
increase in biomass.

Increased rinderpest prevalence would lower wildebeest populations,
increasing the amount of grassÂ (because wildebeests feed on the
grass) and providing more material to start and spread fires, thereby
decreasing the number of trees. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because more rinderpest means fewer wildebeests, which in turn
leads to more grass. (B) is incorrect because fire reduces the tree
population. (D) is incorrect because the figur
