.5.1 Forms of Quadratic Functions 
A quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree 2. So a quadratic function is a 
function of the form

c
a

If we take a = 1 and b = c = 0 in the quadratic function

f x

We get the quadratic function f(x) =x2, whose graph is the parabola.  
A quadratic function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c can be expressed in the standard form

by completing the square. The graph of f is a parabola with vertex (h, k); the parabola 
opens upward if a > 0 or downward if a < 0. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 1 
Let f(x) = 2x2 -12x +23. 
(a) Express f in standard form. 
(b) Find the vertex and x- and y-intercepts of f. 
(c) Sketch the graph of f. 
(d) Find the domain and range of f.
