Cell Potentials under 
Nonstandard Conditions
We have seen how to calculate the emf of a cell when the reactants and products are 
under standard conditions. As a voltaic cell is discharged, however, reactants are con-
sumed and products are generated, so concentrations change. The emf progressively 
drops until E = 0, at which point we say the cell is “dead.” In this section, we examine 
how the emf generated under nonstandard conditions can be calculated by using an 
equation first derived by Walther Nernst (1864–1941), a German chemist who estab-
lished many of the theoretical foundations of electrochemistry.

the Nernst Equation
The effect of concentration on cell emf can be obtained from the effect of concentra-
tion on free-energy change. 
 (Section 19.7) Recall that the free-energy change for any 
chemical reaction, ∆G
