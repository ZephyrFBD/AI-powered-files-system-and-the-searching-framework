What are the identities of isotopes Q and Z? (b) Iso-
tope Q is unusual in that it is very long-lived (its half-life 
is on the order of 1019 yr) in spite of having an unfavorable 
neutron-to-proton ratio (Figure 21.1). Can you propose a 
reason for its unusual stability? (c) Collision of ions of iso-
tope Q with a target was also used to produce the ﬁrst atoms 
of livermorium, Lv. The initial product of this collision was 
296
116Lv. What was the target isotope with which Q collided in 
this experiment?
 21.78  The synthetic radioisotope technetium-99, which decays 
by beta emission, is the most widely used isotope in nuclear 
medicine. The following data were collected on a sample 
 
of 99Tc:

Using these data, make an appropriate graph and curve ﬁt 
to determine the half-life.
