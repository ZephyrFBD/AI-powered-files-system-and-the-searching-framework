ctant. Therefore, 
we use the quantity of H2 to calculate the quantity of NH3 produced:
Moles NH3 = 16.0 mol H22a2 mol NH3
3 mol H2
b = 4.0 mol NH3
Notice that we can calculate not only the number of moles of 
NH3 formed but also the number of moles of each reactant re-
maining after the reaction. Notice also that although the initial 
(before) number of moles of H2 is greater than the final (after) 
number of moles of N2, H2 is nevertheless the limiting reactant 
because of its larger coefficient in the balanced equation.
Check Examine the change row of the summary table to see that 
the mole ratio of reactants consumed and product formed, 2:6:4, 
is a multiple of the coefficients in the balanced equation, 1:3:2. 
We confirm that H2 is the limiting reactant because it is completely 
consumed in the reaction, leaving 0 mol at the end. Because  
6.0 mol H2 has two  
significant figures, our answer has two  
significant figures.
