arch and April) due to rain and melting snow
carrying phosphorus into the bay.
Algal bloom (as indicated by chlorophyll a) increases in the months following an increase in nutrients in the bay
(May through July).
Dense algal blooms block sunlight for underwater grasses.
Large concentrations of unconsumed algal blooms can interfere with the filter-feeding mechanism, so oysters
starve to death.
Dead algal blooms are decomposed by bacteria, which decreases the levels of dissolved oxygen and leaves little
to no oxygen for fish.
Birds that eat fish may through indirect ingestion take up toxins, which at high levels may cause death.
concentrations of unconsumed algal blooms can interfere with the filter-feeding mechanism
and cause filter feeders to starve to death.
Birds are at risk from toxins produced by algal blooms through indirect ingestion. When birds
consume many fish containing toxins, the toxins accumulate and the toxin level can become
deadly.
