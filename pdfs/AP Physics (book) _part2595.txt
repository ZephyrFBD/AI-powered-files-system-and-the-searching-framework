MisConceptual Questions
17. What type of mirror is shown in Fig. 23–50? Explain.
24. A thin converging lens is moved closer to a nearby object.
Does the real image formed change (a) in position, (b) in
size? If yes, describe how.
25. If a glass converging lens is placed in water, its focal length
in water will be (a) longer, (b) shorter, or (c) the same as in
air. Explain.
26. Compare the mirror equation with the thin lens equation.
Discuss similarities and differences, especially the sign
conventions for the quantities involved.
27. A lens is made of a material with an index of refraction
In air, it is a converging lens.
