*65. (II) Two people, one of mass 85 kg and the other of mass
55 kg, sit in a rowboat of mass 58 kg. With the boat 
initially at rest, the two people, who have been sitting at
opposite ends of the boat, 3.0 m apart from each other,
now exchange seats. How far and in what direction will 
the boat move?
*66. (III) A huge balloon and its gondola, of mass M, are in the
air and stationary with respect to the ground. A passenger,
of mass m, then climbs out and slides down a rope with
speed v, measured with respect to the balloon. With what
speed and direction (relative to Earth) does the balloon
then move? What happens if the passenger stops?
mI = 3mII?
