microtubules attach to the fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the homologous chromosomes are
arranged at the midpoint of the cell in metaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated. In
prometaphase II, microtubules attach to the kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister chromatids are arranged
at the midpoint of the cells in metaphase II. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are separated.
Telophase II and Cytokinesis
The chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes.
Cytokinesis separates the two cells into four unique haploid cells. At this point, the newly formed nuclei are both haploid.
The cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and
because of the recombining of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during
crossover. The entire process of meiosis is outlined in Fi
