O molecules adhere to the 
wall more than to each other, 
forming concave surface.
Because cohesive > adhesive,
Hg atoms at the surface
adhere to the wall less than
to each other, forming
convex surface.

Give It Some Thought
As the temperature increases, do you expect the surface tension of 
a liquid to increase, decrease, or stay the same?
Capillary Action
Intermolecular forces that bind similar molecules to one another, 
such as the hydrogen bonding in water, are called cohesive forces. Inter-
molecular forces that bind a substance to a surface are called adhesive 
forces. Water placed in a glass tube adheres to the glass because the 
adhesive forces between the water and the glass are greater than the 
cohesive forces between water molecules; glass is principally SiO2, 
which has a very polar surface. The curved surface, or meniscus, of 
the water is therefore U-shaped (Figure 11.19). For
