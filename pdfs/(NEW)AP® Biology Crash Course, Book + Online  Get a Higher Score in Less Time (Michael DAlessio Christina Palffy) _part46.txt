the electron transport chain.
iii. The electrons eventually reduce NADP+ to NADPH.
iv. Water is split, forming e–, H+, and O2.
v. H+ concentration builds up inside the thylakoids (the thylakoids space).
vi. When H+ move through ATP synthase from the thylakoid space to the stroma, ATP is formed.
vii. NADPH and ATP are used in the second step of photosynthesis, carbon fixation.
C. STEP 2—Calvin Cycle/Light Independent Cycle
1. Occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts.
2. Uses the products (ATP and NADPH) to produce glucose
3. The following figure depicts the steps in the Calvin Cycle:
i.
Six turns of the cycle fix six carbons, representing one molecule of glucose.
ii. Six turns of the cycle require 18 ATP and 12 NADPH.
