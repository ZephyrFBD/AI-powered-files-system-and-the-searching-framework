17â€“9 Electric Energy Storage
52. (I) 650 V is applied to a 2800-pF capacitor. How much
energy is stored?
53. (I) A cardiac defibrillator is used to shock a heart that is
beating erratically. A capacitor in this device is charged to
5.0 kV and stores 1200 J of energy. What is its capacitance?
54. (II) How much energy is stored by the electric field
between two square plates, 8.0 cm on a side, separated by a
1.5-mm air gap? The charges on the plates are equal and
opposite and of magnitude 
55. (II) A homemade capacitor is assembled by placing two 9-in.
pie pans 4 cm apart and connecting them to the opposite ter-
minals of a 9-V battery. Estimate (a) the capacitance, (b) the
charge on each plate, (c) the electric field halfway between the
plates, and (d) the work done by the battery to charge them.
(e) Which of the above values change if a dielectric is inserted?
