Interference
1. Interference effects depend on the simultaneous arri-
val of two or more waves at the same point in space.
2. Constructive interference occurs when waves with
the same wavelength arrive in phase with each other:
a crest of one wave arrives at the same time as a crest
of the other wave(s). The amplitudes of the waves
then add to form a larger amplitude. Constructive
interference also occurs when the path difference is
exactly one full wavelength or any integer multiple
of a full wavelength:
3. Destructive interference occurs when a crest of one
wave arrives at the same time as a trough of the other
