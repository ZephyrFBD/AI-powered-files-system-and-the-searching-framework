One important aspect of science is observation of events, which includes
the design and carrying out of experiments. But observation and experiments

Consider, for example, how two great minds, Aristotle (384–322

Fig. 1–1) and Galileo (1564–1642; Fig. 2–18), interpreted motion along a hori-
zontal surface. Aristotle noted that objects given an initial push along the ground
