9.67 (a) Linear (b) The two central C atoms each have trigonal planar 
geometry with ~120° bond angles about them. The C and O atoms 
lie in a plane with the H atoms free to rotate in and out of this plane.
(c) The molecule is planar with ~120° bond angles about the two N 
atoms. 9.69 (a) Hybrid orbitals are mixtures of atomic orbitals from 
a single atom and remain localized on that atom. Molecular orbitals 
are combinations of atomic orbitals from two or more atoms and are 
delocalized over at least two atoms. (b) Each MO can hold a maxi-
mum of two electrons. (c) Antibonding molecular orbitals can have 
electrons in them.
