The neutrinos emitted in these reactions are all 
(accompanied by 
). But 
the rate at which 
arrive at Earth was measured starting in the late 1960s to be
much less than expected based on the power output of the Sun. It was then pro-
posed that, on the long trip between Sun and Earth,
might turn into 
or 
Subsequent experiments, definitive only in 2001, confirmed this hypothesis. Thus
the three neutrinos,
can change into one another in certain cir-
cumstances, a phenomenon called neutrino flavor oscillation†. (Each of the three
neutrino types is called, whimsically, a different “flavor.”) This result suggests
that the lepton numbers 
and 
are not perfectly conserved. But the sum,
is believed to be always conserved.
