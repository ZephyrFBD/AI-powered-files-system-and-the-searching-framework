 petri dish. Viruses are
different in that they are what we call ‘obligate pathogens’ – that is, they cannot survive or
reproduce without infecting a host ...
… For some diseases, it is possible to establish causation between a microorganism and a
disease by isolating the pathogen from a patient, growing it in pure culture and reintroducing
it to a healthy organism. These are known as ‘Koch’s postulates’ and were developed in 1882.
However, as our understanding of disease and different disease-causing agents has advanced,
these are no longer the method for determining causation [Andrew Kaufman asks why in that
case are there two published articles falsely claiming to satisfy Koch’s postulates].
It has long been known that viral diseases cannot be identified in this way as viruses cannot
be grown in ‘pure culture’. When a patient is tested for a viral illness, this is normally done by
looking for the presence of antigens, or viral genetic code in a host with molecular biology
techniques
