FIGURE 9–13 Example 9–8, forces
on forearm.
Figure 9–14b is a simplified schematic drawing showing the forces on the upper body.
The force exerted by the back muscles is represented by 
the force exerted on
the base of the spine at the lowest vertebra is 
and 
and 
represent
the weights of the head, freely hanging arms, and trunk, respectively. The values
shown are approximations. The distances (in cm) refer to a person 180 cm tall,
but are approximately in the
