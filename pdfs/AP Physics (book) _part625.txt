er
forms of energy can be defined as well. These include electric energy, nuclear
energy, thermal energy, and the chemical energy stored in food and fuels.
These other forms of energy are considered to be kinetic or potential energy 
at the atomic or molecular level. For example, according to atomic theory,
thermal energy is the kinetic energy of rapidly moving moleculesâ€”when an
object is heated, the molecules that make up the object move faster. On the
other hand, the energy stored in food or in a fuel such as gasoline is regarded 
as potential energy stored by virtue of the relative positions of the atoms within
a molecule due to electric forces between the atoms (chemical bonds). The
energy in chemical bonds can be released through chemical reactions. This is
analogous to a compressed spring which, when released, can do work. Electric,
magnetic, and nuclear energies also can be considered examples of kinetic and
potential (or stored) energies. We will deal with these other forms of
