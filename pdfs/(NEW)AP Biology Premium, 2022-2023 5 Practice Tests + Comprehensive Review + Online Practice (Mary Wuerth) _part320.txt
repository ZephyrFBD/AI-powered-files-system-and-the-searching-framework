aid to be linked. Since
linked genes are on the same chromosome (which is a long piece of DNA), they tend to be inherited together more
often than unlinked genes (which are on separate chromosomes).
During prophase I of meiosis, genetic recombination may occur between linked genes. The farther apart two
linked genes are on a chromosome, the more likely a genetic recombination event will occur because there is more
space in which recombination can happen. The closer together two linked genes are on a chromosome, the less
likely a genetic recombination event will occur. Recombination frequencies can be used to create genetic maps that
show the distance between genes on a chromosome, as shown in Table 14.1 and Figure 14.1. The distance between
genes is measured in map units. A recombination frequency of 10% between two genes would place those two
genes 10 map units apart. A recombination frequency of 25% between two genes would place those two genes 25
map units apart.
