ny processes we can imagine that conserve energy but are not observed
to occur in nature. For example, when a hot object is placed in contact with a cold
object, heat flows from the hotter one to the colder one, never spontaneously
from colder to hotter. If heat were to leave the colder object and pass to the hotter
one, energy could still be conserved. Yet it does not happen spontaneously.† As
a second example, consider what happens when you drop a rock and it hits the
ground. The initial potential energy of the rock changes to kinetic energy as the
rock falls. When the rock hits the ground, this energy in turn is transformed into
internal energy of the rock and the ground in the vicinity of the impact; the mole-
cules move faster and the temperature rises slightly. But have you seen the reverse
happen—a rock at rest on the ground suddenly rise up in the air because the
thermal energy of molecules is transformed into kinetic energy of the rock as a
whole? Energy could be conserved in
