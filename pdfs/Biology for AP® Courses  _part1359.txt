enetics. Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive
pattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics
calculations (Table 12.5). To apply these rules, first you must determine n, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the
number of genes segregating two alleles each). For example, a cross between AaBb and AaBb heterozygotes has an n of 2.
In contrast, a cross between AABb and AABb has an n of 1 because A is not heterozygous.

Linked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment
Although all of Mendelâ€™s pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know
that some allele combinations are
