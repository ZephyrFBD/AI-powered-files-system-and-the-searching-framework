Cerebral Cortex
Compared to other vertebrates, mammals have exceptionally large brains for their body size. An entire
alligatorâ€™s brain, for example, would fill about one and a half teaspoons. This increase in brain to body
size ratio is especially pronounced in apes, whales, and dolphins. While this increase in overall brain size
doubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors unique to mammals, it does not tell the
whole story. Scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area of the cortex and
the intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals. This increased surface area is
due, in part, to increased folding of the cortical sheet (more sulci and gyri). For example, a rat cortex is very
smooth with very few sulci and gyri. Cat and sheep cortices have more s
