ignal transduction pathway generated by a membrane-bound receptor protein. Like other kinds of
transduction pathways, the cellular response elicited by a particular receptor protein varies among cell types. Also,
various molecules specific to individual cells, may act as coactivators to direct the target of the transduction
pathway. The target of receptor protein activity may be in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. When the target is in the
nucleus (typically, the DNA), the receptor is often called a nuclear receptor.
A description of a typical intracellular receptor pathway follows (A description of a typical intracellular receptor
pathway follows ( 3):
1. A signaling molecule enters the cytoplasm. The signaling molecule can be a first messenger lipid-soluble
molecule or small molecule that diffuses across the plasma membrane or a second messenger molecule that is
introduced into the cytoplasm as a product of an intracellular transduction pathway.
2. The signaling molecule binds to the in
