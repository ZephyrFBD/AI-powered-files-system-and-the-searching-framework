tructural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the two perpendicular bodies of
the centrosome). In fact, in animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella
and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as discussed below.
Flagella and Cilia
To refresh your memory, flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane
and are used to move an entire cell (for example, sperm, Euglena). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few
flagella. When cilia (singular = cilium) are present, however, many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma
membrane. They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along
the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus,
or cilia lining the cells of the
