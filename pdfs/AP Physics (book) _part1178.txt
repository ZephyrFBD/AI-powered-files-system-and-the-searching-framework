rain set up a resonant oscillation in the bridge. Marching soldiers break step when
crossing a bridge to avoid the possibility that their rhythmic march might match a
resonant frequency of the bridge. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge (Fig. 11–20a) in 1940 occurred as a result of strong gusting winds driving
the span into large-amplitude oscillatory motion. Bridges and tall buildings are
now designed with more inherent damping. The Oakland freeway collapse in 
the 1989 California earthquake (Fig. 11–20b) involved resonant oscillation of a
section built on mudfill that readily transmitted that frequency.
Resonance can be very useful, too, and we will meet important examples
later, such as in musical instruments and tuning a radio. We will also see that
vibrating objects often have not one, but many resonant frequencies.
