Objective
3.1 The student is able to construct scientific explanations that use the structures and
mechanisms of DNA and RNA to support the claim that DNA, and in some cases, RNA are
the primary sources of heritable information.
The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle. The
cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell’s life from the division of a single parent cell to
the production of two new daughter cells. The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated.
Genomic DNA
Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate, a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a
cell’s genetic information is necessary. A cell’s DNA, packaged as a double-stranded DNA molecule, is called its genome.
In prokaryotes, the gen
