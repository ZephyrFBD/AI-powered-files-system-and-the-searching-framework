is heated, it decomposes to form solid mer-
cury(II) oxide, gaseous nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen. (e) Cop-
per metal reacts with hot concentrated sulfuric acid solution to 
form aqueous copper(II) sulfate, sulfur dioxide gas, and water.

 3.17 (a) When the metallic element sodium combines with the 
nonmetallic element bromine, Br21l2, what is the chemical 
formula of the product? (b) Is the product a solid, liquid, or 
gas at room temperature? (c) In the balanced chemical equa-
tion for this reaction, what is the coefficient in front of the 
product if the coefficient in front of Br21l2 is 1?
 3.18 (a) When a compound containing C, H, and O is completely
