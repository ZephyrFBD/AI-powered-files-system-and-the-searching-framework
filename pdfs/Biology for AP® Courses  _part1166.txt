otein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell cycle
checkpoints. An oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression.
Tumor Suppressor Genes
Like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become
cancerous. Tumor suppressor genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators
that, when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-
understood tumor suppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain
events are completed. A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if
there is a problem. Tumor suppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash.
Mutated p53 genes have been identified in
