m dot? 
(d) CdSe quantum dots that are 6.5 nm in diameter emit 
red light upon stimulation. Assuming that the dot is a 
perfect sphere, calculate how many Cd atoms are in one 
quantum dot of this size.   
(e) If you wanted to make one 6.5-nm dot from multiple 2.5-
nm dots, how many 2.5-nm dots would you need, and 
how many CdSe formula units would be left over, if any?
