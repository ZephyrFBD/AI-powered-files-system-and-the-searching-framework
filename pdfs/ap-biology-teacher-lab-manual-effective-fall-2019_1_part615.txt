 should see loading dye moving through the 
gel toward the positive pole of the electrophoresis apparatus. (Note: The purplish-blue 
band in the loading dye migrates through the gel at the same rate as a DNA fragment 
approximately 300 base pairs long.) 
Step 4 Allow the DNA to electrophorese until the loading dye band is about 1 cm from 
the end of the gel. Your teacher may monitor the progress of the electrophoresis in your 
absence if you have to attend another class. 
Step 5 Turn off the power supply, disconnect the leads from the power supply, and remove 
the lid of the electrophoresis chamber. 
Step 6 Carefully remove the casting tray and slide the gel into a staining tray labeled with 
the name of your group. 
•  Measure in centimeters the distance that the purplish-blue loading dye has migrated 
into the gel. Measure from the front edge of the well to the front edge of the dye band 
(also called the dye front). 
•  Be sure to record your data (in centimeters). 
Step 7 Take your
