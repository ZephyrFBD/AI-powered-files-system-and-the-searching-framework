Assigning Appropriate Significant Figures
The state of Colorado is listed in a road atlas as having a population of 5,546,574 and an area of 104,091 square miles. Do the 
numbers of significant figures in these two quantities seem reasonable? If not, what seems to be wrong with them?
SOLUTION
The population of Colorado must vary from day to day as people 
move in or out, are born, or die. Thus, the reported number sug-

gests far greater  
precision than is possible. A reported number of 
5,500,000 would better reflect the actual state of knowledge.
The area of Colorado does not normally vary from time to time, so
