24. (II) A window washer pulls herself upward
using the bucket–pulley apparatus shown in
Fig. 4–48. (a) How hard must she pull down-
ward to raise herself slowly at constant
speed? (b) If she increases this force by 15%,
what will her acceleration be? The mass of
the person plus the bucket is 72 kg.
25. (II) One 3.2-kg paint bucket is hanging by a massless cord
from another 3.2-kg paint bucket, also hanging by a mass-
less cord, as shown in Fig. 4–49. (a) If the
buckets are at rest, what is the tension in 
each cord? (b) If the two buckets are pulled 
upward with an acceleration of 
by 
the upper cord, calculate the tension in each
cord.
