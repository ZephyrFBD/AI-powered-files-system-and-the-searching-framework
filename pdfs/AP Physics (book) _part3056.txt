radii of all possible orbits. The smallest orbit is for
and for hydrogen 
has the value
(27;13)
The radius of the smallest orbit in hydrogen,
is sometimes called the Bohr radius.
From Eq. 27–12, we see that the radii of the larger orbits‡ increase as 
so
The first four orbits are shown in Fig. 27–28. Notice that, according to Bohr’s
model, an electron can exist only in the orbits given by Eq. 27–12. There are no
allowable orbits in between.
For an atom with
we can write the orbital radii,
using Eq. 27–12:
