ce how 
the cell responds to its environment.
IST-3.F
Describe the different types 
of cellular responses elicited 
by a signal transduction 
pathway.
IST-3.F.1
Signal transduction may result in changes in 
gene expression and cell function, which may 
alter phenotype or result in programmed cell 
death (apoptosis).
SUGGESTED SKILL
Argumentation
6.C
Provide reasoning to 
justify a claim by connecting 
evidence to biological 
theories.
