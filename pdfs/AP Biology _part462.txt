 in the
early atmosphere.
Sidney Fox, in more recent years, carried out similar experiments.
However, he began with organic molecules (not the original inorganic
ones) and was able to produce membrane-bound, cell-like structures he
called proteinoid microspheres that would last for several hours.
The Heterotroph Hypothesis and the Theory of
Endosymbiosis
The first cells on Earth were anaerobic heterotrophic prokaryotes. They
simply absorbed organic molecules from the surrounding primordial soup
to use as a nutrient source. They probably began to evolve about 3.5
billion years ago. Eukaryotes did not evolve until another 2 billion years
after the evolution of prokaryotes (about 1.5 billion years ago). Eukaryotes
arose as a result of endosymbiosis according to Lynn Margulis, who
developed the theory of endosymbiosis. She stated that mitochondria and
chloroplasts (and perhaps nuclei) were once free-living prokaryotes that
took up residence inside larger prokaryotic cells. The mutually ben
