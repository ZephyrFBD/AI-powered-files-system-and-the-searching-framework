 Objective: 18.1
In order to detect whether the octopus recognizes faces, the
volunteers could conduct an experiment in which none of their faces
are visible (by using masks to cover them) and observe whether this
has any impact on drenching frequency. If the results showed that
Michael is drenched less o»áen when wearing a mask, it suggests that
the octopus can in fact recognize faces. (C) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because it excludes the volunteer whose face is most likely
