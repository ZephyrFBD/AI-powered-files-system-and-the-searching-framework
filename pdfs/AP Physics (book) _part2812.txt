 is easier to next find 
(part c) using Eq. 25–4 before we find 
SOLUTION (a) The overall magnification is
(b) The eyepiece focal length is (Eq. 25–5)
Next we solve Eq. 25–4 for 
and find
Then, from the thin lens equation for the objective with
(see Fig. 25–24a),
so
(c) We just calculated
which is very close to 
25–6 Aberrations of Lenses and Mirrors
In Chapter 23 we developed a theory of image formation by a thin lens. We found,
for example, that all rays from each point on an object are brought to a single
point as the image point. This result, and others, were based on approximations for
a thin lens, mainly that all rays make small angles with the axis and that we can 
use
Because of these approximations, we expect deviations from the
simple theory, which are referred to as lens aberrations. There are several types of
aberration; we will briefly discuss each of them separately, but all may be present
at one time.
Consider an object at any point (even at infinity) on the axis of a le
