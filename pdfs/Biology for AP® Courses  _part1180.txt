position of a gene on a chromosome
stage of mitosis during which chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate
equatorial plane midway between the two poles of a cell where the chromosomes align during
metaphase
(also, karyokinesis) period of the cell cycle during which the duplicated chromosomes are separated into identical
