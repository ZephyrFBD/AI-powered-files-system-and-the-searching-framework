 of the 
DRY plant materials, not of the water in the plant. Make sure your procedure accounts 
for this. Describe this procedure in your lab notebook and then check with your teacher 
for approval and suggestions. Be sure to record your observations, questions, reflections, 
and measurements daily in your notebook. In your lab notebook, record information 
about the size and overall appearance of your Fast Plants. 
Step 3 In your notebook, graphically present a comparison of the biomass/energy of 
plants early in their life cycle versus older plants. 
Step 4 Determine the average (mean) grams of biomass added per plant over the period of 
growth. Each gram of plant biomass represents about 4.35 kcal of energy. Convert grams 
of biomass/day to NPP (kcal)/day. Show this work in your lab notebook. Explain why 
this is net primary productivity and not gross productivity.
