The formation of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional image can be done
using techniques similar to those for computed tomography (Section 25–12). The
simplest thing to measure for creating an image is the intensity of absorbed 
and or reemitted radiation from many different points of the body, and this
would be a measure of the density of H atoms at each point. But how do we
determine from what part of the body a given photon comes? One technique is
to give the static magnetic field a gradient; that is, instead of applying a uniform
magnetic field,
the field is made to vary with position across the width of the
sample (or patient), Fig. 31–26. Because the frequency absorbed by the H nuclei
is proportional to 
(Eq. 31–11), only one plane within the body will have the
