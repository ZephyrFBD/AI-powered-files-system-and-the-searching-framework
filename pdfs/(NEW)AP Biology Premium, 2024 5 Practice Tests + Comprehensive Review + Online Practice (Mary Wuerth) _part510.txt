13. The males of a particular species of bird attract mates with their bird songs. Male birds were observed, and the
duration of their bird songs were recorded. The durations of the bird songs were classified into three groups:
less than 120 seconds, 120–299 seconds, and 300–480 seconds. The number of females that approached the
male birds within the 30-minute period, including during and immediately following the bird songs, was
recorded. A graph of the data with 95% confidence intervals follows.
(a) Based on the data provided, make a claim about how the duration of the bird songs affects the number of
females approaching the males.
(b) Describe the type of reproductive isolation that bird songs are an example of. Identify one more example
of this type of reproductive isolation.
