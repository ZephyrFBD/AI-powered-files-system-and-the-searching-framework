h chamber where gastric juices are secreted. The four-compartment gastric
chamber provides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. The fermentation
process produces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. As in other animals, the small
intestine plays an important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.

Figure 25.8 Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs. The first two stomachs, the rumen and
the reticulum, contain prokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber. The ruminant regurgitates cud
from the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it into a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water. The cud then
passes onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested by enzymes produced by the ruminant.
Pseudo-ruminants
Some animals, such as camels and alpacas,
