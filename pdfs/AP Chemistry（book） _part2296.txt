The constant k in the rate law is called the rate constant; the expo-
nents m, n, and so forth are called reaction orders for the reactants. The 
sum of the reaction orders gives the overall reaction order. Reaction or-
ders must be determined experimentally. The units of the rate con-
stant depend on the overall reaction order. For a reaction in which 
the overall reaction order is 1, k has units of s-1; for one in which the 
overall reaction order is 2, k has units of M -1 s-1.
Spectroscopy is one technique that can be used to monitor the 
course of a reaction. According to Beerâ€™s law, the absorption of elec-
tromagnetic radiation by a substance at a particular wavelength is di-
rectly proportional to its concentration.
CONCENTRATION AND TIME (SECTION 14.4) Rate laws can be 
used to determine the concentrations of reactants or products at any 
time during a reaction. In a first-order reaction the rate is proportional 
to the concentration of a single reactant raised to
