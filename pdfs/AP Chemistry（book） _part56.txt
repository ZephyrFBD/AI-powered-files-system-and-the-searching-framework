arity and effectiveness 
of the text, the art, and the exercises. Among the myriad changes 
there are certain points of emphasis that we use to organize and 
guide the revision process. In creating the fourteenth edition 
our revision was organized around the following points:
t Our treatment of energy and thermochemistry has been 
significantly revised. The concept of energy is now intro-
duced in Chapter 1, whereas previously it did not appear 
until Chapter 5. This change allows instructors greater 
freedom in the order in which they cover the material. For 
example, this change would facilitate coverage of Chap-
ters 6 and 7 immediately following Chapter 2, a sequence 
that is in line with an atoms-first approach to teaching 
general chemistry. More importantly, bond enthalpies 
are now integrated into Chapter 5 to emphasize the con-
nection between macroscopic quantities, like reaction 
enthalpies, and the submicroscopic world of atoms and 
bonds. We feel this change leads to a b
