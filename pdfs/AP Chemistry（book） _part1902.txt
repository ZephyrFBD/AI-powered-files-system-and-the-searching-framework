ictates how efficiently molecules 
pack together in three dimensions. Benzene 1C6H62, for example, is a highly symmet-
rical planar molecule. 
 (Section 8.6) It has a higher melting point than toluene, a 
compound in which one of the hydrogen atoms of benzene has been replaced by a CH3 
group (Figure 12.28). The lower symmetry of toluene molecules prevents them from 
packing in a crystal as efficiently as benzene molecules. As a result, the intermolecular 
forces that depend on close contact are not as effective and the melting point is lower. 
In contrast, the boiling point of toluene is higher than that of benzene, indicating that 
the intermolecular attractive forces are larger in liquid toluene than in liquid benzene. 
The melting and boiling points of phenol, another substituted benzene shown in Fig-
ure 12.28, are higher than those of benzene because the OH group of phenol can form 
hydrogen bonds.
