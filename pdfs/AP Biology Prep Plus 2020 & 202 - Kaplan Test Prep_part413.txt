iscussed. Each NADH generates 3 ATP
except for the 2 NADH that were reduced during glycolysis; these NADH
cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane and must transfer their
electrons to an intermediate carrier molecule, which delivers the
electrons to the second carrier protein complex, Q. Therefore, these
NADH generate only 2 ATP per glucose. Thus, the 2 NADH of glycolysis
yield 4 ATP, the other 8 NADH yield 24 ATP, and the 2 FADH2 produce 4
ATP, for a total of 32 ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.
The total amount of ATP produced during eukaryotic glucose catabolism
is 4 via substrate level phosphorylation plus 32 via oxidative
phosphorylation, for a total of 36 ATP. (For prokaryotes the yield is 38
ATP because the 2 NADH of glycolysis don’t have any mitochondrial
membranes to cross and therefore don’t lose energy.) See the following
table for a summary of eukaryotic ATP production.
