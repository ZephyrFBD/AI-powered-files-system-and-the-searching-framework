n. Ferguson’s ‘models’ predicted that up to150, 000
could die from ‘mad cow disease’, or BSE, and its version in sheep if
it was transmiĴed to humans. BSE was not transmiĴed and instead
triggered by an organophosphate pesticide used to treat a pest on
cows. Fewer than 200 deaths followed from the human form. Models
by Ferguson and his fellow incompetents led to the unnecessary
culling of millions of pigs, caĴle and sheep in the foot and mouth
outbreak in 2001 which destroyed the lives and livelihoods of
farmers and their families who had oĞen spent decades building
their herds and ﬂocks. Vast numbers of these animals did not have
foot and mouth and had no contact with the infection. Another
‘expert’ behind the cull was Professor Roy Anderson, a computer
modeller at Imperial College specialising in the epidemiology of
human, not animal, disease. Anderson has served on the Bill and
Melinda Gates Grand Challenges in Global Health advisory board
and chairs another Gates-funded organisation
