Figure 7.14 The green color seen in these coastal waters is from an eruption of hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria.
These anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in the water.

How does the formation of NAD+
differ between aerobic and anaerobic respiration?
a.
NAD+
is formed in aerobic respiration by a fermentation process and formed in anaerobic respiration by
oxidation of NADH .
b.
NAD+ is formed by a fermentation process in anaerobic conditions by the conversion of pyruvate into
lactate and by simple oxidation of NADH in aerobic respiration.
c.
Under aerobic conditions, the electron accept
