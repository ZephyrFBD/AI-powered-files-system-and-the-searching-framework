lity of 
that solute. That is,
the solubility of a particular solute in a particular solvent is the maximum amount  
of the solute that can dissolve in a given amount of the solvent at a specified  
temperature, assuming that excess solute is present.
For example, the solubility of NaCl in water at 0 °C is 35.7 g per 100 mL of water. This is 
the maximum amount of NaCl that can be dissolved in water to give a stable equilibrium 
solution at that temperature.
If we dissolve less solute than the amount needed to form a saturated solution, the 
solution is unsaturated. Thus, a solution containing 10.0 g of NaCl per 100 mL of water 
at 0 °C is unsaturated because it has the capacity to dissolve more solute.
Under suitable conditions, it is possible to form solutions that contain a greater amount 
of solute than needed to form a saturated solution. Such solutions are supersaturated. 
For example, when a saturated solution of sodium acetate is made at a high temperature 
and then slowly cool
