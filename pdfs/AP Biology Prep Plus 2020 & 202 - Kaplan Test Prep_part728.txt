aked finches
that can take advantage of food sources underutilized by the large-
beaked population. This would be an example of gene flow. (C) is thus
correct. (A) is incorrect because visitors feeding the finches would not
necessarily cause the population to diversify. (B) is incorrect because a
novel mutation is not necessary to introduce small beaks into the
population; small beaks already exist on the mainland. (D) is incorrect
because there is no connection suggested in the question between the
destruction of the finch habitat and a selective pressure for smaller
beaks.

With such similar answer choices, this question can best be answered
using the process of elimination. As noted in the question stem, TT and
TC represent specific alleles, so the values in the table are allelic
frequencies. This eliminates (B) and (D), which wrongly suggest that
these are genotypic frequencies. In Hardy-Weinberg calculations,
allelic frequencies are represented by the
