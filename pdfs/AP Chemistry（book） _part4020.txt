ng ions, all met-
als form cations. The only nonmetallic element that forms cations 
is the metalloid Sb, which is likely to have signiﬁcant metallic char-
acter. 7.59 Ionic: SnO2, Al2O3, Li2O, Fe2O3; molecular: CO2, H2O. 
Ionic compounds are formed by combining a metal and a non-
metal; molecular compounds are formed by two or more nonmetals.  
7.61 MnO will react more readily with HCl. 7.63 (a) Dichlorine hep-
toxide (b) 2 Cl2(g) + 7 O2(g) ¡  2 Cl2O7(l) (c) Cl2O7 is an acidic 
oxide, so it will be more reactive to base, OH-. (d) The oxidation state 
of Cl in Cl2O7 is +7; the corresponding electron conﬁguration for Cl 
is 3He42s22p6 or 3Ne4. 7.65 (a) BaO(s) + H2O(l) ¡  Ba(OH)2(aq)
(b) FeO(s) + 2 HClO4(aq) ¡ Fe(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O(l)
(c) SO3(g) + H2O(l) ¡  H2SO4(aq)
(d) CO2(g) +  2 NaOH(aq) ¡ Na2CO3(aq) + H2O(l)
7.67 (a) Ca is more reactive because it has a lower ionization energy 
than Mg. (b) K is more reactive because it has a lower ionization 
energy than Ca. 7.69 (a) 2 K(s) + Cl2(g)
