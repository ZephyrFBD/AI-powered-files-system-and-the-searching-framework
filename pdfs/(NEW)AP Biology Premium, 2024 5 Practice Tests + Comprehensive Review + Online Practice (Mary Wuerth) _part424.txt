parates fragments of DNA according to their size. Bacterial transformation involves
the uptake and expression of foreign DNA by bacteria, so choice (A) is incorrect. CRISPR-Cas9 is used for
gene editing, so choice (B) is incorrect. PCR amplifies specific sequences of DNA, so choice (D) is also
incorrect.
4. (B) DNA ligase attaches DNA fragments together, joining them with phosphodiester bonds. Choice (A) is
incorrect because bacterial transformation is used to insert naked, foreign DNA into a cell. Gel electrophoresis
separates DNA fragments by size, so choice (C) is incorrect. Polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify the
number of copies of a specific sequence of DNA, so choice (D) is incorrect.
5. (A) Bacterial transformation inserts naked, foreign DNA into a bacterial cell. CRISPR-Cas9 is used for gene
editing, not inserting plasmids into a cell, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because gel
electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments according to their s
