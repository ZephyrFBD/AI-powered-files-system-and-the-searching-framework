cose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As
glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that
binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.
The lac Operon: An Inducer Operon
The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to
activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The lac operon is a typical
inducible operon. As mentioned previously, E. coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations
are low. To do so, the cAMPâ€“CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar
source is lactose. The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment.
