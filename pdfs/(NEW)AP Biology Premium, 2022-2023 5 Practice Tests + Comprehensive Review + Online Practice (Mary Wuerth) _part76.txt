13. Aquatic animals produce carbon dioxide as a product of cellular respiration. Carbon dioxide combines with
water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which releases hydrogen ions (H+) into solution. Four test tubes
(containing 10 mL of water each and different numbers of aquatic snails) are prepared. pH levels were
measured in each tube at the beginning of the experiment and after 20 minutes. The results are shown in the
following table.
(a) Explain why tubes B, C, and D all had lower pH levels after 20 minutes.
(b) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
(c) Analyze the data, and predict which tube (B, C, or D) contained 100 times as many H+ ions as that of tube
A after 20 minutes.
(d) Aquatic plants, such as Elodea, perform cellular respiration, but they also perform photosynthesis.
