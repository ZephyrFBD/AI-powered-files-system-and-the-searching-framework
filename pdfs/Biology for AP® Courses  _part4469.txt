ives because the females feed on their wax. As the females approach, the male defending the nest will mate with
them. Harem mating structures are a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling
a territory with resources. Elephant seals, where the alpha male dominates the mating within the group are an example.
A third type of polygyny is a lek system. Here there is a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate
displays for females, and the females choose their mate from this group. This behavior is observed in several bird species
including the sage grouse and the prairie chicken.
In polyandrous mating systems, one female mates with many males. These types of systems are much rarer than
monogamous and polygynous mating systems. In pipefishes and seahorses, males receive the eggs from the female, fertilize
them, protect them within a pouch, and give birth to the offspring (Figure 36.39). Therefore, the female is able to provide
eggs to
