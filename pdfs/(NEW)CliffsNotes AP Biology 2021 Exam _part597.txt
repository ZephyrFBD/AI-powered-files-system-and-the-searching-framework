Characteristics That Distinguish the Sexes
In most vertebrates, especially mammals, males and females are distinguished by both primary and secondary sex
characteristics. The primary sex characteristics are the structures directly involved in reproduction. The uterus and
ovaries in females and the testes in males are examples. In contrast, secondary sex characteristics include such
human features as body hair (pubic hair and beards, for example), distribution of muscle and fat, voice quality, and
breasts. Deer antlers, lion manes, and peacock tails are examples of secondary sex characteristics in nonhumans. In
general, secondary sex characteristics are used to indicate sexual maturity or sexual readiness and to attract or locate
mates, or are used by males to compete for females (visual displays and aggression).
