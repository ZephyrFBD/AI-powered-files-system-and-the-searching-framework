Statics
1. Choose one object at a time for consideration. Make
a careful free-body diagram by showing all the forces
acting on that object, including gravity, and the points
at which these forces act. If you aren’t sure of the
direction of a force, choose a direction; if the actual
direction of the force (or component of a force) is oppo-
site, your eventual calculation will give a result with a
minus sign.
2. Choose a convenient coordinate system, and resolve
the forces into their components.
3. Using letters to represent unknowns, write down the
equilibrium equations for the forces:
and
assuming all the forces act in a plane.
