 ATP. Most of the molecules of the ETC are
cytochromes, electron carriers that resemble hemoglobin in the structure
of their active site. The functional unit contains a central iron atom, which
is capable of undergoing a reversible redox reaction; that is, it can be
alternatively reduced (gain electrons) and oxidized (lose electrons).
AP EXPERT NOTE
Everything the human body does to deliver inhaled oxygen to
tissues (discussed in chapter 11) comes down to the role oxygen
plays as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport
chain. Without oxygen, ATP production is not adequate to sustain
human life. Similarly, the CO2 generated in the citric acid cycle is
the same carbon dioxide we exhale.
FMN (flavin mononucleotide) is the first molecule of the ETC. It is reduced
when it accepts electrons from NADH, thereby oxidizing NADH to NAD+.
Sequential redox reactions continue to occur as the electrons are
transferred from one carrier to the next; each carrier is reduced as it
accepts a
