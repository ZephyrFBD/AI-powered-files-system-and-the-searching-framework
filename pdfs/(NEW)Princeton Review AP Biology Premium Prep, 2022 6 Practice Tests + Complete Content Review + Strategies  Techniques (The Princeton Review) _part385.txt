ause it is the least related to all of the other species.
Species B, C, D, and E all have the shared character of 8 legs. Wings are a shared character for species D and E, but
they could also be considered a derived character since they separate species D and E from the rest of the species
that do not have wings.
GENETIC VARIABILITY
As you know, no two individuals are identical. The differences in each person are known as genetic variability. All
this means is that no two individuals in a population have identical sets of alleles (except, of course, identical twins).
In fact, survival of a species is dependent on this genetic variation; it allows a species to survive in a changing
environment. If a population were all the same, then they would have the same weaknesses and the same strengths.
Natural selection occurs only if some individuals have more evolutionary fitness and can be selected. The more
variations there are among a population, the more likely that a trait will exist that
