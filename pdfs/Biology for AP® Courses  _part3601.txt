other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin. To aid this diffusion,
amphibian skin must remain moist.
Birds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: They fly. Flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds
require a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes. Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with

the oxygen needed to enable flying. Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange.
Oxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide
diffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. The details of breathing between birds and mammals
differ substantially.
In addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sa
