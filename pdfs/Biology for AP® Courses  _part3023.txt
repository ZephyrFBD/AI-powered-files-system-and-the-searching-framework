t animals
allow stronger smooth muscle contractions,
which break down plant material. Plant material
is difficult to digest because animals lack
cellulase to break down cellulose.
c.
Multiple stomach chambers present in ruminant
animals contain cellulase, which break down
plant material. Plant material is difficult to digest
because animals lack cellulase to break down
cellulose.
d.
Multiple stomach chambers in ruminant animals
allow the food to stay in the stomach for a longer
time so that peristaltic movements and the action
of enzymes on food particles occurs for a longer
time.
