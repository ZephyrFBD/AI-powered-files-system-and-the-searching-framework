l energy loss (MgH) is transformed completely into transla-
tional kinetic energy of the box, whereas for rolling objects the initial potential
energy is shared between translational and rotational kinetic energies, and so the
speed of the CM is less. For each of the rolling objects we can state that the decrease in
potential energy equals the increase in translational plus rotational kinetic energy:
For all our rolling objects, the moment of inertia 
is a numerical factor times
the mass M and the radius 
(Fig. 8–20). The mass M is in each term, so the
translational speed v doesn’t depend on M; nor does it depend on the radius R
since 
so 
cancels out for all the rolling objects. Thus the speed v at
the bottom of the incline depends only on that numerical factor in 
which
expresses how the mass is distributed. The hoop, with all its mass concentrated
at radius R
has the largest moment of inertia; hence it will have
the lowest speed and will arrive at the bottom behind the D-cell 
which
