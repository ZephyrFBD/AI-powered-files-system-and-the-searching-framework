gh for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack
the boxes one on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana. This implies that they could visualize the result
of stacking the boxes even before they had performed the action. This type of learning is much more powerful and versatile
than conditioning.
Cognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it. Maze running experiments
done with rats by H.C. Blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal. The motivation for
the animals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end. In these studies, the animals in Group I were
run in one trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run (Figure 36.43). Group II rats were
not fed in the maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after. Group III
