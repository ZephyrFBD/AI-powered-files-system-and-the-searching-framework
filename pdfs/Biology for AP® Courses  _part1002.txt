What is the relationship between a ligand’s structure and its mechanism of action?
Connection for AP® Courses
Just like you communicate with your classmates face-to-face, using your phone, or via e-mail, cells communicate with
each other by both inter’and intracellular signaling. Cells detect and respond to changes in the environment using signaling
pathways. Signaling pathways enable organisms to coordinate cellular activities and metabolic processes. Errors in these
pathways can cause disease. Signaling cells secrete molecules called ligands that bind to target cells and initiate a chain
of events within the target cell. For example, when epinephrine is released, binding to target cells, those cells respond by
converting glycogen to glucose. Cell communication can happen over short distances. For example, neurotransmitters are
released across a synapse to transfer messages between neurons Figure 1.3. Gap junctions and plasmodesmata allow sm
