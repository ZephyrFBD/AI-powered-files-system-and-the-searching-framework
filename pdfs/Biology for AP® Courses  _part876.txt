ds. These same molecules can serve as energy sources for the
glucose pathways.
7.5 Metabolism without Oxygen
If NADH cannot be oxidized through aerobic respiration, another electron acceptor is used. Most organisms will use some
form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of NAD+, ensuring the continuation of glycolysis. The regeneration
of NAD+ in fermentation is not accompanied by ATP production; therefore, the potential of NADH to produce ATP using
an electron transport chain is not utilized.
7.6 Connections of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Lipid Metabolic Pathways
The breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids connect with the pathways of glucose catabolism. The
simple sugars are galactose, fructose, glycogen, and pentose. These are catabolized during glycolysis. The amino acids
from proteins connect with glucose catabolism through pyruvate, acetyl CoA, and components of the citric acid cycle.
Cholesterol synthesis starts with acetyl groups, and the compone
