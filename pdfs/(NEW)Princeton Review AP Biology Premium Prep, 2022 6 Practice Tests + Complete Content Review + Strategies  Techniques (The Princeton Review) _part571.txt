ncubated at 25째C for 30 minutes and several rounds of mitosis occurred. Separate
colonies were then exposed to temperatures near 37째C at different times during the cell cycle. For each colony,
the cell cycle was arrested immediately after the last phase of mitosis.
(a) Describe how a mutation in DNA can lead to a protein that no longer functions correctly.
(b) Explain the impact of the radiolabeled dye on the cell cycle.
(c) Predict what would happen if the cdc mutants were initially incubated at 37째C and then switched to 25째C.
(d) Justify your prediction.
4. A prairie was sampled by entomological researchers to determine the species abundance and diversity. Three
years into the study a fire swept through the prairie. Two years later quadrant sampling was completed again.
Results were compiled in the table below.
