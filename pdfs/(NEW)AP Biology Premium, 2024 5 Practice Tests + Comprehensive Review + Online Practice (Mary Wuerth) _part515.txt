 reduced hybrid viability.
10. (B) Since tigers and leopards can mate and produce a zygote, but doing so does not result in any viable
offspring, this is an example of reduced hybrid viability. It is not gametic isolation since their gametes can form
a zygote, so choice (A) is incorrect. There is no infertile adult hybrid in this scenario, so choice (C) is also
incorrect. No viable hybrid was produced, so there is no chance of hybrid breakdown, making choice (D)
incorrect.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) Species A is the outgroup, and according to the cladogram, the only characteristic it possesses is body
segmentation.
(b) Species B has body segmentation, antennae, and feathers. Species D has body segmentation, antennae, and
fur.
(c)
(All three possible positions for species X on the above cladogram would be considered acceptable.)
(d) Species C has feathers, which is a characteristic that it has in common with species B. Species D has fur,
which species C does not possess. Therefore, spe
