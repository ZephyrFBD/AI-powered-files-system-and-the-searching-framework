he fact that equilibrium constants and reaction rates 
change with temperature. By applying Le Châtelier’s principle 
to this endothermic reaction and treating heat as a reactant, 
we deduce that an increase in temperature shifts the equilib-
rium in the direction of more NO. The equilibrium constant 
Kp for formation of 1 mol of NO from its elements at 300 K is 
only about 1 * 10-15 (Figure 15.17). At 2400 K, however, the 
equilibrium constant is about 0.05, which is 1013 times larger 
than the 300 K value.
Figure 15.17 helps explain why NO is a pollution prob-
lem. In the cylinder of a modern high-compression automo-
bile engine, the temperature during the fuel-burning part of 
the cycle is approximately 2400 K. Also, there is a fairly large 
excess of air in the cylinder. These conditions favor the for-
mation of NO. After combustion, however, the gases cool 
quickly. As the temperature drops, the equilibrium in Equa-
tion 15.26 shifts to the left (because the reactant heat is being
