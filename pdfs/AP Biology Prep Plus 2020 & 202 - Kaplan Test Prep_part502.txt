ect the ability of organisms to
maintain organization, grow, and reproduce. Organisms that acquire
excess free energy will either use the energy for growth or store the
energy, while organisms that acquire insuﬀicient free energy will lose
mass and ultimately die. Since the energetic costs of reproduction are
large, depending on energy availability, diﬀerent organisms use various
reproductive strategies. For instance, plants and animals may reproduce
seasonally during the most energetically favorable part of the year
(determined by ambient temperature and food availability). A biennial
plant takes two years to complete its life cycle. In the first year, the plant
germinates and grows, and then becomes dormant in the colder months.
During the subsequent year, the plant produces flowers and fruits.
Animals may undergo reproductive diapause, a period during which
growth or development is suspended and metabolism is decreased in
response to adverse environmental conditions such as temperat
