l properties (such as water).
6. Primitive heterotrophic prokaryotes formed about 3.9 bya.
 
Heterotrophs are living organisms that obtain energy by consuming organic substances. Pathogenic bacteria, for
example, are heterotrophic prokaryotes.
The organic “soup” was a source of organic material for heterotrophic cells. As these cells reproduced, competition
for organic material increased. Natural selection would favor those heterotrophs most successful at obtaining food.
The earliest fossils date to 3.5 bya.
7. Primitive autotrophic prokaryotes were formed.
As a result of mutation, a heterotroph gained the ability to produce its own food. As an autotroph, this cell would
be highly successful.
Autotrophs manufacture their own organic compounds using light energy or energy from inorganic substances.
Cyanobacteria (photosynthetic bacteria), for example, are autotrophic prokaryotes that obtain energy and
manufacture organic compounds by photosynthesis.
8. Oxygen and the ozone layer formed
