us equation we have
We solve this for 
and obtain
[constant acceleration]
(2;10)
which is the other useful equation we sought.
We now have four equations relating position, velocity, acceleration, and
time, when the acceleration a is constant. We collect these kinematic equations
for constant acceleration here in one place for future reference (the tan background
screen emphasizes their usefulness):
(2;11a)
(2;11b)
(2;11c)
(2;11d)
These useful equations are not valid unless a is a constant. In many cases we
can set 
and this simplifies the above equations a bit. Note that x repre-
sents position (not distance), also that
is the displacement, and that is the
elapsed time. Equations 2–11 are useful also when a is approximately constant
to obtain reasonable estimates.
