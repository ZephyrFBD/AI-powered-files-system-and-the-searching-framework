representing the “original
population” on the graph should correspond to a higher population
frequency of “flowering only” plants, thus reaching its peak earlier,
than the line corresponding to the “population aȇer flood.” Thus, (C)
can be eliminated. (D) is incorrect because, while it may be possible for
the post-flood population to produce both flowers and spores, it is
unlikely that the original population had equal numbers of flower-
producing and spore-producing plants, especially since the question
stem explains that it is a flowering plant.

As competition for resources increased in aquatic environments,
plants began to migrate to more terrestrial environments. On land,
they faced new problems, like supporting the plant’s entire structure
and avoiding dehydration. As a result, they developed modifications
that better enabled them to live on land. One of these modifications
was the increased production of the photoreceptor phytochrome,
which is a pigm
