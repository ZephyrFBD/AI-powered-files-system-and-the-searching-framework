 V. Many are connected in series to
produce a higher voltage. Such series strings are connected in parallel within 
a photovoltaic panel. Research includes experimenting with combinations of
semiconductors. A good photovoltaic panel can have an output of perhaps
averaged over day and night, sunny and cloudy. The world’s total elec-
tricity demand is on the order of 
which could be met with solar cells
covering an area of only about 
of Earth’s surface.†
Photodiodes (Section 27–3) and semiconductor particle detectors (Section 30–13)
operate similarly.
LEDs
A light-emitting diode (LED) is sort of the reverse of a photovoltaic cell. When a
pn junction is forward biased, a current begins to flow. Electrons cross from the
n-region into the p-region, recombining with holes, and a photon can be emitted
with an energy about equal to the band gap energy,
This does not work well with
silicon diodes.‡ But high light-emission is achieved with compound semiconductors,
typically involving a group II
