rethroid insecticides. 
Predict the susceptibility of the mosquitoes to the insecticides. The scientists claim that the mosquito population of 
region B evolved resistance over the period of the experiment and that resistance arose as a result of the immigration of 
resistant mosquitoes from other regions. Based on the data in Table 1 and the information provided, provide evidence to 
support the scientists’ claim.
