roteins, and glycoproteins secreted by the cells. The matrix provides mechanical
support and helps bind adjacent cells together. The most common substance in this region is the protein collagen.
Cell junctions serve to anchor cells to one another or to provide a passageway for cellular exchange. They include
the following (Figure 3-5):

Anchoring junctions are protein attachments between adjacent animal cells. One such junction, the desmosome,
consists of proteins that bind adjacent cells together, providing mechanical stability to tissues. Desmosomes are also
associated with intermediate filaments that extend into the interior of the cell and serve to hold cellular structures
together.
Tight junctions are tightly stitched seams between animal cells. The junction completely encircles each cell,
producing a seal that prevents the passage of materials between the cells. Tight junctions are characteristic of cells
lining the digestive tract, where materials are required to pass
