In addition, we may also tend to be suspicious of a graph if we see a sharp peak, unless 
the experimental points were taken very close together. For example, common sense 
would tell us to be careful about accepting the rate curve shown in Figure A.23.

Obviously, most of the shape is given to the profile by the one measurement at 60°. In 
biology, as in everything else, mistakes can be made, so the experimenter would have to 
check the validity of that measurement very carefully. The easiest way to do that would 
be to make more measurements slightly above and slightly below 60° to see whether 
these would fall on the line the experimenter has drawn. Alternat
