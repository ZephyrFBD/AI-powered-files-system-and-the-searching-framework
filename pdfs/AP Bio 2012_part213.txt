g Objective
3.14: The student is able to apply mathematical routines  
to determine Mendelian patterns of inheritance provided 
by data.
Characteristics of a 
STRONG Response
The student is able to write a coherent paragraph that shows 
an understanding of independent assortment, linkage, and 
recombination in the transmission of genes from parent to 
offspring. A prediction of a 1:1:1:1 ratio will be supported 
by a diagram or Punnett square. The student will be able 
to use a chi-square analysis to show that the results of the 
cross do not fit the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio predicted by 
independent assortment and will be able to explain that the 
genes for body color and eye color are linked on the same 
chromosome. A strong student may also predict the relative 
location of the genes on the chromosome based on the data.
Characteristics of a
