Connection for AP® Courses
Both terrestrial and aquatic biomes are affected by global conditions, such as climate. Scientists have noted marked changes
that have altered global weather patterns. Collectively, these changes are called global climate change and include a
worldwide increase in temperature due primarily to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are several causes
of global climate change, including human activity. The effects of human activity on other aspects of ecosystems will be
explored in the Conservation Biology and Biodiversity chapter.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Frame
