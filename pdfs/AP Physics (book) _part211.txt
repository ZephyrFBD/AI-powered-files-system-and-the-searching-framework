28. (II) In coming to a stop, a car leaves skid marks 65 m long
on the highway. Assuming a deceleration of 
estimate the speed of the car just before braking.
29. (II) A car traveling at 
strikes a tree. The front end
of the car compresses and the driver comes to rest after
traveling 0.80 m. What was the magnitude of the average
acceleration of the driver during the collision? Express the
answer in terms of “g’s,” where

slows down at a constant
just by “letting up on the gas.” Calculate (a) the
distance the car coasts before it stops, (b) the time it
takes to stop, and (c) the distance it travels during the
first and fifth seconds.
31. (II) Determine the stopping distances for an automobile
going a constant initial speed of

when she sees a red
light ahead. Her car is capable of decelerating at a rate of
