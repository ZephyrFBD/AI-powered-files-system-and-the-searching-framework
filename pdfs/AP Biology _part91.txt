possible that aquaporins can also function as gated channels that open and
close in response to variables such as turgor pressure of a cell. The sudden
change in a cell in response to changes in tonicity as seen in Figure 3.15
may be the result of the action of aquaporins.
It is interesting to note that while aquaporins facilitate the rapid passage
of H2O across membranes, they will not carry hydronium ions (H3O+).
This is most likely because the hydronium ion is charged, while a water
molecule is not. Aquaporins, like many channels, are very specific.
Active Transport
Active transport is the movement of molecules against a gradient, which
requires energy, usually in the form of ATP. There are many examples of
active transport.
