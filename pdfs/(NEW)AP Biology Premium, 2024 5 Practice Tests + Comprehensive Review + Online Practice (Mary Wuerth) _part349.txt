h of the following correctly describes a structural difference between DNA and RNA?
(A) DNA has a five-carbon sugar; RNA has a four-carbon sugar.
(B) DNA has thymine; RNA has uracil.
(C) DNA has adenine; RNA has cytosine.
(D) DNA is typically single-stranded; RNA is typically double-stranded.
Questions 5 and 6
N-15, also known as heavy nitrogen, is an isotope of nitrogen that is heavier than the isotope that is typically found
in nature, N-14. Conducting chemical reactions in the presence of different isotopes of nitrogen allow a scientist to
follow nitrogen atoms in a metabolic pathway. In a classic experiment, Meselson and Stahl allowed parent DNA
(containing N-15) to replicate in the presence of N-14.
5. After one round of DNA replication, which of the following results would support the statement “DNA
replication is semiconservative”?
(A) All DNA molecules have one strand containing N-14 and one strand containing N-15.
(B) 50% of the DNA molecules only contain N-14, and 50% of the
