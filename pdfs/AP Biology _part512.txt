nverted to organic
matter at the next trophic level. This means that if you begin with 10,000
kJ of plant matter, the food chain can support 1,000 kJ of herbivores
(primary consumers), 100 kJ of secondary consumers, and only 10 kJ of
tertiary consumers. As a result of the loss of energy from one trophic level
to the next, food chains are rather short. They never have more than four or
five trophic levels. As you might expect, long food chains are less stable
than short ones. This is because population fluctuations at lower trophic
levels are magnified at higher levels, causing local extinction of top
predators. A good model to demonstrate the interaction of organisms in the
food chain and the loss of energy is the food pyramid; see Figure 12.7.

Food chains are not isolated; they are interwoven with other food chains
into a food web. An animal can occupy one trophic level in one food chain
and a different trop
