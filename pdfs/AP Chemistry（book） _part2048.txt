Now suppose we exert greater pressure on the piston and compress the gas above 
the solution, as shown in the middle container in Figure 13.12. If we reduce the gas vol-
ume to half its original value, the pressure of the gas increases to about twice its origi-
nal value. As a result of this pressure increase, the rate at which gas molecules strike the 
liquid surface and enter the solution phase increases. Thus, the solubility of the gas in 
the solution increases until equilibrium is again established; that is, solubility increases 
until the rate at which gas molecules enter the solution equals the rate at which they 
Go Figure
If the partial pressure of a gas over a solution is doubled, how has the 
concentration of gas in the solution changed after equilibrium is restored?
Equilibrium
Pressure is increased.
More CO2 dissolves
Equilibrium restored
