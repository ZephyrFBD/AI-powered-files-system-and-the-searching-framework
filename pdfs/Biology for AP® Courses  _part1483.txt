uct an experiment step-by-step, click through this review (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
miescher_levene) of how he discovered the key role of DNA and proteins in the nucleus.
Why were Phoebus Leveneâ€™s discoveries important to our current understanding of DNA?
a.
Phoebus Levene believed that the four nucleotides in DNA are not linked or repeated in the same pattern and
that they are held together by phosphodiester bonds.
b.
He discovered that the nucleotides were held together by phosphodiester bonds, in which two phosphate
groups bind two sugars together. This discovery led to our current understanding of DNA.
c.
He believed that proteins were less likely the vehicles for hereditary information. Later he discovered the
four nucleotides in DNA which were linked together and repeated in a wide variety of different ways.
d.
He believed inaccurately that the four nucleotides in DNA repeated over in the same pattern. Also, he
discovered that the nucleotides were held together by phosphodie
