ox would have been zero. For a hollow box, the external field is not
changed since the electrons in the metal can move just as freely as before to the
surface. Hence the field inside the hollow metal box is also zero, and the field lines
are shown in Fig. 16–36b. A conducting box is an effective device for shielding
delicate instruments and electronic circuits from unwanted external electric fields.
We also can see that a relatively safe place to be during a lightning storm is inside
a parked car, surrounded by metal. See also Fig. 16–37, where a person inside a
porous “cage” is protected from a strong electric discharge. (It is not safe in a
lightning storm to be near a tree which can conduct, or out in the open where
you are taller than the surroundings.)
