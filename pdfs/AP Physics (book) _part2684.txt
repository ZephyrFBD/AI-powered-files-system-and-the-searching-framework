 in
Fig. 24–33a), where rays in air can enter glass (or be reflected). Because there is
a phase shift only at the lower surface, there will be a dark band (no reflection)
when the path difference is
and so on. Since the light rays are
perpendicular to the plates, the extra path length (DEF) equals 2 , where is
the thickness of the air gap at any point.
SOLUTION Dark bands will occur where
Bright bands occur when
where m is an integer. At the 
position of the wire,
At this point there will be 
wavelengths. This is a “half
integer,” so the area next to the wire will be bright. There will be a total 
of 25 dark lines along the plates, corresponding to path lengths DEF of
including the one at the point of contact A 
Between them, there will be 24 bright lines plus the one at the end, or 25.
NOTE The bright and dark bands will be straight only if the glass plates are
extremely flat. If they are not, the pattern is uneven, as in Fig. 24–33c. Thus we
see a very precise way of testing a glass
