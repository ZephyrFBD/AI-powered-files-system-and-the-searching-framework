l the possible intermolecular forces can be operating at the same 
time, and there is a wide range of energies for these interactions. 
Consider ammonia, NH3. It is a gas at P = 1 atm, T = 25 °C. Am-
monia can be liquefied at -33.5 °C (P = 1 atm). Methylamine, 
CH3NH2, is a derivative of ammonia and is also a gas at P = 1 atm, 
T = 25 °C. Methylamine can be liquefied at −6.4 °C (P = 1 atm).
Use these experimental data to determine which molecule has 
the stronger intermolecular attractive interactions, ammonia or 
methylamine; and suggest reasons for your conclusion. Based on 
your reasons, what other experiments could you do with these 
molecules, or related molecules, to test your hypothesis?
