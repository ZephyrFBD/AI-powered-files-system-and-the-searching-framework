against DNA from the suspect. Because of the accuracy of RFLP analysis,
these cases can be solved with a high degree of certainty, and some
suspects have been convicted on DNA evidence alone. By contrast, several
incidents have occurred where prisoners who have been jailed for many
years for violent crimes were proven innocent by DNA evidence and
released.
Complementary DNA (cDNA)
When scientists try to clone a human gene in a bacterium, the introns (long
intervening, noncoding sequences) present a problem. Bacteria lack introns
and have no way to edit them out after transcription. Therefore, in order to
clone a human gene in a bacterium, scientists must insert a gene with no
introns. To do this, scientists extract fully processed mRNA from cells and
then use the enzyme reverse transcriptase (obtained from retroviruses)
to make DNA transcripts of this RNA. The resulting DNA molecule
carries the complete coding sequence of interest but without introns. The
DNA produced by retroviruses
