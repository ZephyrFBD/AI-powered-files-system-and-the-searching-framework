4. 2 pyruvate are formed.
In summary, glycolysis takes 1 glucose molecule and turns it into 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH, and a net of 2 ATP (made 4
ATP, but used 2 ATP). The process occurs in the cytosol.
The Krebs Cycle
The Krebs cycle details what happens to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis. Although the Krebs cycle is
described for 1 pyruvate, remember that glycolysis produces 2 pyruvate. In Figure 4-3, the “× 2” next to the
pyruvate and the Krebs cycle is a reminder to multiply the products of this cycle by 2 to account for the products of
a single glucose.
The processing of pyruvate can be summarized as follows:
1. Pyruvate to acetyl CoA. In a step leading up to the actual Krebs cycle, pyruvate combines with coenzyme A
(CoA) to produce acetyl CoA. In
 
that reaction, 1 NADH and 1 CO2 are also produced.
 
2. Krebs Cycle: 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, 1 ATP, 2 CO2. The Krebs cycle
 
begins when acetyl CoA combines with OAA (oxaloacetate) to form citrate. There are seven intermediate produc
