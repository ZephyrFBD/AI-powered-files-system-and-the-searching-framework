 Cl¬ Cl, (c) Se¬ O, (d) H ¬I. Which is the more 
 
electronegative atom in each polar bond?
 8.42 Arrange the bonds in each of the following sets in or-
der of increasing polarity: (a) C ¬ F, O¬ F, Be¬F;  
(b) O¬Cl, S ¬Br, C ¬ P; (c) C ¬ S, B¬ F, N ¬ O.
 8.43 (a) From the data in Table 8.2, calculate the effective charges 
on the H and Br atoms of the HBr molecule in units of the 
electronic charge, e. (b) If you were to put HBr under very 
high pressure, so its bond length decreased significantly, 
would its dipole moment increase, decrease, or stay the 
same, if you assume that the effective charges on the atoms 
do not change?

 8.44 The iodine monobromide molecule, IBr, has a bond length 
of 2.49 Å and a dipole moment of 1.21 D. (a) Which atom of 
the molecule is expected to have a negative charge? (b) Cal-
culate the effective charges on the I and Br atoms in IBr in 
units of the electronic charge, e.
