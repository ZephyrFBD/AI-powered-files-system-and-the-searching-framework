(B) Animals that spend 30 days in ARD live 
significantly longer after reintroduction 
of food than animals that spend only  
3 days in ARD. 
(C) The number of days an animal spends in 
ARD does not significantly affect its time  
of survival after reintroduction of food. 
(D) The large standard errors of the means make 
conclusions from the data impossible. 
27. Based on the experimental results, which of the
following is the best evolutionary explanation for
the occurrence of ARD in C. elegans ?
(A) The ability to enter ARD provides a strong
selective advantage because reproduction 
can occur despite periods of food scarcity. 
(B) Acquiring the genes for ARD gives 
individuals a selective advantage because 
they produce more offspring than do 
individuals who cannot enter ARD. 
(C) Individuals who can enter ARD are selected 
for in the population because they live 
longer than do individuals who cannot 
enter ARD. 
(D) Individuals who can enter ARD have high 
fitness because they can
