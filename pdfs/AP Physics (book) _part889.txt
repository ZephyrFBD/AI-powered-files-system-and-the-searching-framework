). The friction
force between her hands and the clay is 1.5 N total. (a) How
large is her torque on the wheel, if the diameter of the bowl
is 9.0 cm? (b) How long would it take for the potter’s wheel 
to stop if the only torque acting on it is due to the potter’s
hands? The moment of inertia of the wheel and the bowl is
0.11 kgm2.

47. (III) An Atwood machine
consists of two masses,
and 
connected by a massless
inelastic cord that passes over a pulley free to rotate,
Fig. 8–52. The pulley is a solid cylin-
der of radius 
and mass
6.0 kg. (a) Determine the accelera-
tion of each mass. (b) What % error
would be made if the moment of
inertia of the pulley is ignored?
[Hint: The tensions 
and 
are
not equal. We discussed the Atwood
machine in Example 4–13, assuming
for the pulley.]
