of the early gnathosomes (jawed vertebrates).
Which of the following best describes a major diﬀerence in the
evolutionary relationships suggested by the cladograms?

In cladogram A only, the crown gnathostomes and crown
osteichthyans both diverged into more than one clade.
(A)
In cladogram A only, the crown gnathostomes were a
common ancestor for the conventionally-defined
chondrichthyans.
(B)
In cladogram B only, Entelognathus forms its own clade.
(C)
In cladogram B only, the Guiyu lineage shares a closer
ancestor with the actinopterygians than with the
sarcopterygians.

10. A researcher identifies a characteristic found in crown
osteichthyans but not in the placoderms. Examine the cladogram
of early Gnathostomes shown below.
Assuming the simplest possible explanation, how many
