wth medium was fixed at two different pH levels
and determined the effects of AZ and DIDS on the rate of
photosynthesis by measuring oxygen concentrations at
various times. The results are shown in the two graphs
below. The arrows indicate the time points during which
HCO3-, AZ, and DIDS were added to each system.
Figure 8.23 This figure displays the effects of AZ and DIDS
on the rate of photosynthesis of two systems, system A and
system B, in a line graph. The line graph plots the oxygen
concentration over time.
In which system, A or B, is there a strong reliance on the
bicarbonate ion as the mechanism of carbon uptake by the
cell? Justify your answer using the data.
D. If both systems are dosed with the same concentrations
of bicarbonate ion, in which system, A or B, is the pH
higher? Justify your answer using the data and the
bicarbonate-carbon dioxide equilibrium equation.
