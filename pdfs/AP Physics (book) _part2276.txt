46. (I) A 42-cm-long solenoid, 1.8 cm in diameter, is to produce
a 0.030-T magnetic field at its center. If the maximum cur-
rent is 4.5 A, how many turns must the solenoid have?

53. (I) A galvanometer needle deflects full scale for a 
current. What current will give full-scale deflection if the
magnetic field weakens to 0.760 of its original value?
54. (II) A circular coil 12.0 cm in diameter and containing nine
loops lies flat on the ground. The Earth’s magnetic field at
this location has magnitude 
and points into
the Earth at an angle of 56.0° below a line pointing due
north. If a 7.20-A clockwise current passes through the coil,
(a) determine the torque on the coil, and (b) which edge of
the coil rises up: north, east, south, or west?
