Section II: Free-Response Section = 50% of the exam grade
You will have 90 minutes to answer 4 short free-response questions and 2 long free-response questions.
To achieve a high score on the free-response questions, you must provide ample scientific reasoning,
relevant examples, and other appropriate evidence to support their answers. The 2 long questions focus on
evaluating and interpreting results from experiments. One of the two requires graphing. The 4 short
questions involve scientific investigation, conceptual analysis, model or visual analysis, and data analysis.
You are permitted to use a four-function calculator (with square root), scientific, or graphing calculator to
answer questions on both sections of the exam since both sections contain questions requiring data
manipulation. To see which types of calculators are approved for the AP® Biology exam, visit
