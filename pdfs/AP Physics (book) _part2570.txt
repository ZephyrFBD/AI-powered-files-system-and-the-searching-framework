and the focal length of a thin lens. This equation will make the determination of
image position quicker and more accurate than doing ray tracing. Let 
be the
object distance, the distance of the object from the center of the lens, and 
be the
image distance, the distance of the image from the center of the lens, Fig. 23–40.

THIN LENS EQUATION
Let 
and 
refer to the heights of the object and image. Consider the two rays shown
in Fig. 23–40 for a converging lens, assumed to be very thin. The right triangles 
and FBA (highlighted in yellow) are similar because angle AFB equals angle 
so
since length
Triangles 
and 
are similar as well. Therefore,
We equate the right sides of these two equations (the left sides are the same), and
divide by 
to obtain

This is called the thin lens equation. It relates the image distance 
to the object
distance 
and the focal length f. It is the m
