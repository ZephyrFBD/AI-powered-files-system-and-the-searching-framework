 (radially) that when the guard cells absorb
water by osmosis and become turgid, they curve like hot dogs, causing the
stomate to open. When guard cells lose water and become flaccid, the
stomate closes. See Figure 14.2. In addition, some plants have stomates
nestled in stomatal crypts that further minimize exposure of the stomate
to air. This reduces water loss even more. (Review Chapter 7,
“Photosynthesis.”)

TRANSPORT IN PLANTS
Plants employ a variety of mechanisms to transport substances short and
long distances. The selective permeability of plasma membranes controls
short-distance movement of substances into and out of cells. Both active
and passive transport mechanisms occur in plants, and plant cell
membranes are equipped with the same types of pumps, channels, and
transport proteins that other cells have.
Short-Distance Transport
Short-distance transport of water occurs by osmosis, the diffusion o
