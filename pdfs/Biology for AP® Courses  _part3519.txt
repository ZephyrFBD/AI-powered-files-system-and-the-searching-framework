ion) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the
start of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural
signal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to
the muscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate.
The end of the neuron’s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small
space called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the
neuron’s axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.
The ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across
their cell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions,
