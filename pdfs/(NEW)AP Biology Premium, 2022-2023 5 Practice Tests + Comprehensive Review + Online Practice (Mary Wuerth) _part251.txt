) A mutation in the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (that rendered it ineffective) would result in a cell that could not
make the secondary messenger cyclic AMP. This would disrupt any cell signaling process that contains a
step that requires cyclic AMP.
(d) Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP, so an ineffective adenylyl cyclase would
result in no cAMP production.
12. (a) Cell types C and D did not respond to the presence of the hormone because they most likely did not have
the receptor for the hormone.
(b) Petri dishes 1, 3, 5, and 7 are the experimental controls for each of the four cell types in the experiment.
(c) If a molecule that irreversibly binds to this hormone was added to Petri dish 4 before the hormone was
added, the level of glucose in the Petri dish would most likely remain unchanged after 30 minutes.
(d) The irreversible binding of the molecule to the hormone would prevent the hormone from binding to its
receptor in the cell. Without the binding of the ho
