ingle line of chromosomes on the
spindle. A Pair of chromosomes is pulled apart
and migrate towards pole in anaphase I, while in
anaphase II sister chromatids separate.
Telophase I reconstitutes the nucleus and loosen
the chromosomes, while telophase II mimics
telophase I.
b.
Prophase I condenses the chromosomes and
eliminates the nuclear membrane. The
microtubules arrange in a spindle. Prophase II
mimics prophase I. Metaphase I occurs when
chromosomes appear in homologous pairs on the
spindle. Metaphase II has a single line of
chromosomes on the spindle. Pairs of
chromosomes are pulled apart and migrate
towards the poles during anaphase I, while in
anaphase II sister chromatids separate.
Telophase I reconstitutes the nucleus and
condenses the chromosomes, while telophase II
mimics telophase I.
c.
Prophase I condense the chromosomes and add
nuclear membrane. The microtubules arrange in
a spindle. Prophase II mimics prophase I.
Metaphase I occurs when chromosomes appear
in homologous pa
