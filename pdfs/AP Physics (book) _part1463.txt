 greater the difference in concentration, the greater
the flow rate. Indeed, the rate of diffusion, J (number of molecules or moles or
kg per second), is directly proportional to the difference in concentration per
unit distance,
(which is called the concentration gradient), and to
the cross-sectional area A (see Fig. 13–28):
(13;10)
D is a constant of proportionality called the diffusion constant. Equation 13–10 is
known as the diffusion equation, or Fick’s law. If the concentrations are given in
then J is the number of moles passing a given point per second. If the con-
centrations are given in 
then J is the mass movement per second 
The length 
is given in meters, and area A in m2. The values of D for a variety
of substances diffusing in a particular medium are given in Table 13–4.
