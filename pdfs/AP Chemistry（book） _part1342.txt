have multiple resonance structures? If so, how many res-
onance structures do you find? (d) Which of the Lewis 
structures in part (a) yields the most favorable formal 
charges for the molecule?
 8.67 There are many Lewis structures you could draw for sul-
furic acid, H2SO4 (each H is bonded to an O). (a) What 
Lewis structure(s) would you draw to satisfy the octet rule? 
 
(b) What Lewis structure(s) would you draw to minimize 
 
formal charge?
 8.68 Some chemists believe that satisfaction of the octet rule 
should be the top criterion for choosing the dominant Lewis 
structure of a molecule or ion. Other chemists believe that 
achieving the best formal charges should be the top crite-
rion. Consider the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H2PO4
-, in 
which the H atoms are bonded to O atoms. (a) What is the 
predicted dominant Lewis structure if satisfying the octet 
rule is the top criterion? (b) What is the predicted dominant 
Lewis structure if achieving the best formal charges is the to
