 molecule), two molecules of
pyruvate (a three-carbon molecule) are obtained. During this sequence of
reactions, 2 ATP are used (in steps 1 and 3) and 4 ATP are generated (2 in
step 6 and 2 in step 9). Thus, there is a net production of 2 ATP per
glucose molecule. This type of phosphorylation is called substrate level
phosphorylation because ATP synthesis is directly coupled with the
degradation of glucose without the participation of an intermediate
molecule, such as NAD+. One NADH is produced per PGAL, for a total of 2
NADH per glucose.
Glycolysis
The net reaction for glycolysis is:
Glucose + 2 ADP + 2 Pi + 2 NAD+ â†’ 2 Pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2
H2O
This series of reactions occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
However, at this stage, much of the initial energy stored in the glucose
molecule has not been released and is still present in the chemical bonds
of pyruvate. Depending on the capabilities of the organism, pyruvate
degradation can proceed in one of two dir
