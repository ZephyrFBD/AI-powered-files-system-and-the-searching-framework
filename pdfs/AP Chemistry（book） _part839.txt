 produce H2O1g2 instead 
of H2O1l2, would you expect the magnitude of ∆H to in-
crease, decrease, or stay the same? Explain.
 5.48 Consider the decomposition of liquid benzene, C6H61l2, to 
gaseous acetylene, C2H21g2:
 
 
C6H61l2 ¡  3 C2H21g2 ∆H = +630 kJ
 
 (a)  
What is the enthalpy change for the reverse reaction?
 
 (b)  
What is ∆H for the formation of 1 mol of acetylene?
 
 (c)  
Which is more likely to be thermodynamically favored, 
the forward reaction or the reverse reaction?
 
 (d)  
If C6H61g2 were consumed instead of C6H61l2, would you 
expect the magnitude of ∆H to increase, decrease, or 
stay the same? Explain.
Calorimetry (section 5.5)
 5.49 (a) What are the units of molar heat capacity? (b) What are 
the units of specific heat? (c) If you know the specific heat of 
copper, what additional information do you need to calcu-
late the heat capacity of a particular piece of copper pipe?
