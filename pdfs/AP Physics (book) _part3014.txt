UV or IR light is sometimes used in burglar alarms because of its invisibility. Many
smoke detectors use the photoelectric effect to detect tiny amounts of smoke 
that interrupt the flow of light and so alter the electric current. Photographic light
meters use this circuit as well. Photocells are used in many other devices, such as
absorption spectrophotometers, to measure light intensity. One type of film sound
track is a variably shaded narrow section at the side of the film, Fig. 27–8. Light
passing through the film is thus “modulated,” and the output electrical signal 
of the photocell detector follows the frequencies on the sound track. For many
applications today, the vacuum-tube photocell of Fig. 27–6 has been replaced by a
semiconductor device known as a photodiode (Section 29–9). In these semicon-
ductors, the absorption of a photon liberates a bound electron so it can move
freely, which changes the conductivity of the material and the current t
