Na+ and Cl– are formed.
A covalent bond is formed when electrons are shared between atoms. If the electrons are shared equally between the
atoms, the bond is called nonpolar covalent. If the electrons are shared unequally, the bond is called polar
covalent. When one pair of electrons is shared between two atoms, the result is a single covalent bond. When two
pairs of electrons are shared, the result is a double covalent bond. When three pairs of electrons are shared, the result
is a triple covalent bond.
WATER: THE VERSATILE MOLECULE
One of the most important substances in nature is water. Water is considered a unique molecule because it plays an
important role in chemical reactions.
Water Weight
Did you know that more than 60 percent of your body weight consists of
water?
Let’s take a look at one of the properties of water. Water has two hydrogen atoms joined to an oxygen atom.
In water molecules, the electrons are not shared equally in the bonds between hydrogen and oxygen. This mean
