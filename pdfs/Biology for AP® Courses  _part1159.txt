s bound to E2F,
production of proteins necessary for the G1/S transition is blocked. As the cell increases in size, Rb is slowly phosphorylated
until it becomes inactivated. Rb releases E2F, which can now turn on the gene that produces the transition protein, and this
particular block is removed. For the cell to move past each of the checkpoints, all positive regulators must be “turned on,”
and all negative regulators must be “turned off.”

Figure 10.14 Rb halts the cell cycle and releases its hold in response to cell growth.
Rb and other proteins that negatively regulate the cell cycle are sometimes called tumor supressors. Why do you think
the name tumor suppressor might be appropriate for these proteins?
a.
They inhibit cell division.
b.
They enhance the rate of cell division.
c.
They start the cell cycle, thereby suppressing tumor formation.
d.
These proteins, when phosphorylated, allow the cell cycle to proceed.
