rove that the equilib-
rium constant is the same for the catalyzed reaction as for 
the uncatalyzed one.
 [15.98] The phase diagram for SO2 is shown here. (a) What does 
this diagram tell you about the enthalpy change in the 
reaction SO21l2 ¡ SO21g2? (b) Calculate the equi-
librium constant for this reaction at 100 °C and at 0 °C.  
(c) Why is it not possible to calculate an equilibrium con-
stant between the gas and liquid phases in the supercriti-
cal region? (d) At which of the three points marked in red 
does SO21g2 most closely approach ideal-gas behavior? 
 
(e) At which of the three red points does SO21g2 behave 
least ideally?
 15.99 At 800 K, the equilibrium constant for the reaction 
 
A21g2 ∆2 A1g2 is Kc = 3.1 * 10-4.  (a) Assuming both 
forward and reverse reactions are elementary reactions, 
which rate constant do you expect to be larger, kf  or kr? 
(b) If the value of kf = 0.27 s-1, what is the value of kr 
at 800 K? (c) Based on the nature of the reaction, do you
