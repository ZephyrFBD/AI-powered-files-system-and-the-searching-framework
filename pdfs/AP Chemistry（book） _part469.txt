he quantities of reactants 
consumed and products formed, however, are restricted by the quantity of the limiting reac-
tant. For example, when a combustion reaction takes place in the open air, oxygen is plenti-
ful and is therefore the excess reactant. If you run out of gasoline while driving, the car stops 
because the gasoline is the limiting reactant in the combustion reaction that moves the car.
Before we leave the example illustrated in Figure 3.17, let’s summarize the data:
     2 H21g2 +  O21g2 i  2 H2O1g2
Before reaction:
    10 mol
    7 mol
      0 mol
Change (reaction):
-10 mol
-5 mol
+10 mol
After reaction:
      0 mol
    2 mol
    10 mol
10 H2O and 2 O2 (no H2 molecules)
10 H2 and 7 O2

▲ Figure 3.17 Limiting reactant. Because H2 is completely consumed, it is the limiting reactant. 
Because some O2 is left over after the reaction is complete, it is the excess reactant. The amount 
of H2O formed depends on the amount of limiting reactant, H2
