bag and a larger bag is 0.2 pounds (that is, 20 percent; 1.0 pound feels the same as 1.1 pounds, but 1.0
pound feels less than 1.2 pounds), then the JND between the 20-pound bag and a larger bag will also be
20 percent. (So, 20 pounds feels the same as 22 pounds or 23 pounds, but 20 pounds feels less than 24
pounds.)
Test the hypothesis: Enlist 24 participants, and split them into two groups of 12. To set up the
demonstration, assuming a 10 percent increment was selected, have the first group be the one-pound
group. As a counter-balancing measure against a systematic error, however, six of the first group will
compare one pound to two pounds, and step down in weight (1.0 to 2.0, 1.0 to 1.9, and so on.), while the
other six will step up (1.0 to 1.1, 1.0 to 1.2, and so on). Apply the same principle to the 20-pound group (20
to 40, 20 to 38, and so on, and 20 to 22, 20 to 24, and so on). Given the large difference between 20 and 40
pounds, you may wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weig
