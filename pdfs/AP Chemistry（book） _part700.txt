The sign conventions for q, w, and ∆E are summarized in Table 5.1. Notice that any 
energy entering the system as either heat or work carries a positive sign.

Suppose a system receives a “deposit” of 50 J of work from the 
surroundings and loses a “withdrawal” of 85 J of heat to the surroundings. 
What is the magnitude and the sign of ∆E for this process?
