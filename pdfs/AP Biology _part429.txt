ant to Pesticides
******ebook converter DEMO Watermarks*******
Insects do not actually become resistant to pesticides. Instead, some insects
are naturally resistant to a particular chemical insecticide. When the
environment is sprayed with that insecticide, the resistant insects have the
selective advantage. All the insects not resistant to the insecticide die, and
the remaining resistant ones breed quickly with no competition. The
entirely new population is resistant to the insecticide. The natural selection
toward insecticide resistance is an example of directional selection.

Species extinction rates are rapid at times of ecological stress.
TYPES OF SELECTION
Natural selection can alter the frequency of inherited traits in a population
in five different ways, depending on which phenotypes in a population are
favored. Five types of selection are stabilizing, disruptive or
diversifying, directional, sexual, and artificial; see Figure 11.2 for a few
of these types of selection.
