the formation of the 
ionic solid from its elements.
transition Metal Ions
Because ionization energies increase rapidly for each successive electron removed, the 
lattice energies of ionic compounds are generally large enough to compensate for the loss 
of up to only three electrons from atoms. Thus, we find cations with charges of 1+, 2+,  
or 3+ in ionic compounds. Most transition metals, however, have more than three 
 
electrons beyond a noble-gas core. Silver, for example, has a 3Kr44d105s1 electron config-
uration. Metals of group 1B (Cu, Ag, Au) often occur as 1+ ions (as in CuBr and AgCl). 
 
In forming Ag+, the 5s electron is lost, leaving a completely filled 4d subshell. As in this 
 
example, transition metals generally do not form ions that have a noble-gas configuration. 
The octet rule, although useful, is clearly limited in scope.

Recall from Section 7.4 that when a positive ion forms from an atom, electrons are 
always l
