 
that tremendous energies were involved. In January 1939, Meitner 
and Frisch published a short article describing the reaction. In March 
1939, Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn at Columbia University discovered 
that more neutrons are produced than are used in each ﬁssion. As we 
have seen, this result allows a chain reaction to occur.
News of these discoveries and an awareness of their potential 
use in explosive devices spread rapidly within the scientiﬁc commu-
nity. Several scientists ﬁnally persuaded Albert Einstein, the most 
famous physicist of the time, to write a letter to President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt explaining the implications of these discoveries. Einstein’s 
letter, written in August 1939, outlined the possible military appli-
cations of nuclear ﬁssion and emphasized the danger that weapons 
based on ﬁssion would pose if they were developed by the Nazis. 
Roosevelt judged it imperative that the United States investigate the 
possibility of such weapons. Late in 1941, the
