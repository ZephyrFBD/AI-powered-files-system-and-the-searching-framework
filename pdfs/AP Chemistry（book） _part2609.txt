onegativity of Y increases, so does the acidity of the substance. This happens for two 
reasons: First, as electron density is drawn toward Y, the O ¬H bond becomes weaker 
and more polar, thereby favoring loss of H+. Second, because the conjugate base of any 
acid YOH is usually an anion, its stability generally increases as the electronegativity 
of Y increases. This trend is illustrated by the Ka values of the hypohalous acids (YOH 
acids where Y is a halide ion), which decrease as the electronegativity of the halogen 
atom decreases (Figure 16.20).

As the electronegativity 
of Y increases, electron 
density shifts toward Y.

3 Protons are more readily 
transferred to H2O, leading 
to increased acid strength.
