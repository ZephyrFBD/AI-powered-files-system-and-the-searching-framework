5. The crocodile, finch, and chicken share a more recent common
ancestor than do any of the other species shown on the tree.
Which of the following is the most likely description of the type of
egg their most recent common ancestor would have made?
The most recent common ancestor of the crocodile, finch, and
chicken likely made an egg without a shell because frogs are
ancestors to all of them and made that type of egg.
(A)
The ancestor of the crocodile, finch, and chicken likely made a
hard-shelled egg because two of the three make hard-shelled
eggs.
(B)
The ancestor of the crocodile, finch, and chicken likely made an
egg with a leathery covering because species more distantly
related to all of them also produced leathery shelled eggs.
(C)
It is impossible to draw that kind of conclusion from the data
presented.
