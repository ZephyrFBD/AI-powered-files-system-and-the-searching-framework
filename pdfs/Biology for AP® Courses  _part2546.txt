d and
used in the treatment of human disease.
d.
Extremophiles have specialized adaptations that
allow them to live in extreme conditions. These
adaptations can be mobilized to help humans.
For example, some radiation-resistant
prokaryotes have developed DNA repair
mechanisms. Also, they could be developed and
used in the treatment of human disease.
38. Describe briefly how you would detect the presence of
a non culturable prokaryote in an environmental sample.
a.
Recombinant DNA techniques are used to detect
the presence of a non-culturable prokaryote in an
environmental sample. Polymerase chain
reaction is used to amplify selected portions of
prokaryotic DNA.
b.
Molecular biology techniques are used to detect
the presence of a non-culturable prokaryote in an
environmental sample. Electrophoresis is used to
amplify selected portions of prokaryotic DNA.
c.
Molecular biology techniques are used to detect
the presence of a non-culturable prokaryote in an
environmental sample. Polymerase
