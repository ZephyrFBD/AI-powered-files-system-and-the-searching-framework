might this contribute to genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and cri du chat 
syndrome?

■ Part 5: Meiosis and Crossing Over in Sordaria 
The fungus Sordaria fimicola exchanges genetic material when two mycelia meet and 
fuse. The resulting zygote undergoes meiosis to produce asci; each ascus contains eight 
haploid spores. A single gene determines the spore color.
