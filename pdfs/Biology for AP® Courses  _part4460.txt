idual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives
because of common lineage). Mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring. Emperor penguins migrate
miles in harsh conditions to bring food back for their young. Selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and
is still discussed among scientists in related fields.
Even less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from
seemingly altruistic behavior. The activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples.
Sterile workers in these societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring,
she is passing on genes from the workers indirectly. Thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen
without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility. The lowering of individu
