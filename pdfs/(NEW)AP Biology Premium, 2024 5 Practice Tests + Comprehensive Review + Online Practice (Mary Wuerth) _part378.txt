uld require a
minimum of 12 Ã— 3 = 36 nucleotides. Choice (A) is incorrect because 6 nucleotides would only contain two
codons. Since 3 nucleotides are required to make a codon, 12 nucleotides would only be sufficient to code for
four amino acids, so choice (B) is incorrect. While 48 nucleotides might code for 12 amino acids if there were
introns to be removed, 48 is not the minimum number of nucleotides required, so choice (D) is incorrect.
2. (B) Eukaryotic genes contain introns; prokaryotic genes do not. Prokaryotes do not have the spliceosomes
required to remove introns. So if a eukaryotic gene was directly inserted into a bacterial genome, the bacteria
would likely try to translate the introns and produce a different protein. Choice (A) is incorrect because
prokaryotes and eukaryotes do use the same genetic code. While prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, they do
contain RNA polymerase and can perform transcription, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect
because rough en
