egrate information, and produce responses.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the action potentials would not increase due to 
interference from the antibody.
(B)
This option is correct because the antibody binds to the acetylcholine 
receptors, thus making fewer receptors on the postsynaptic neuron available 
for acetylcholine stimulation. This answer indicates that the student is able to 
interpret a visual representation of the nervous system to describe how this 
system integrates information to produce a response.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The number of sodium-gated channels in the muscle 
does not change.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Acetylcholine must bind to the receptor in order to have 
an effect. Unbound acetylcholine in the junction has no effect.
