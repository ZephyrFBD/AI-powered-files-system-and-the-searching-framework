It then oxidizes a hydroxyethyl
group to an acetyl group, producing NADH.
Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase removes a carboxyl
group from pyruvate producing carbon dioxide.
d.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase removes carboxyl
group from pyruvate producing carbon dioxide.
Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase transfers enzyme-
bound acetyl groups to CoA forming an acetyl-
CoA molecule. Lastly, a hydroxyethyl group is
oxidized to an acetyl group, producing NADH.
33. How do the roles of ubiquinone and cytochrome c
differ from the other components of the electron transport
chain?
a.
CoQ and cytochrome c are mobile electron
carriers while NADH dehydrogenase and
succinate dehydrogenase are bound to the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
b.
CoQ and cytochrome covalently bind electrons
while NADH dehydrogenase and succinate
dehydrogenase are bound to the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
c.
CoQ and cytochrome c are bound to the inner
mitochondrial membrane while NADH
dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase are
mobile electro
