short as a fraction of a second or as long as billions of years. Carbon-14
has a half-life of 5,730 years. Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion
years. Half-life is not affected by temperature, pressure, or any other
environmental conditions.
Fossils contain isotopes of elements that accumulated in the organisms
when they were alive. For example, living organisms contain mostly the
stable carbon isotope carbon-12 (C-12), as well as a small amount of
radioactive carbon-14 (C-14). When the organism dies, it stops
accumulating carbon and the amount of C-12 in its tissues remains the
same. However, the C-14 that it contained at the time of death slowly
decays into another element, nitrogen-14 (N-14). Therefore, by measuring
the ratio of C-14 to C-12 in a fossil, you can determine the fossilâ€™s age.
This method of carbon dating works for fossils up to age 75,000 years.
If a fossil is older than that, it contains too little carbon-14 to be detected
by current equipment.
