various changes in the electronic environments 
of the atoms involved. Nuclei, though certainly 
not unimportant, remain unchanged during 
chemical reactions. There is, however, another 
kind of reaction that we have yet to examine, one 
in which nuclei undergo change, thereby altering 
the very identities of the atoms involved.

CHEMISTRY
 21.1 ▶  Radioactivity and Nuclear 
Equations Learn to describe nuclear 
reactions using equations analogous to 
chemical equations, in which the nuclear 
charges and masses of reactants and 
products are in balance. Also learn that 
radioactive nuclei most commonly decay by 
emission of alpha, beta, or gamma radiation.
 
21.2 ▶  Patterns of Nuclear Stability  
Recognize that nuclear stability is determined 
largely by the neutron-to-proton ratio. For 
stable nuclei, this ratio increases with 
increasing atomic number. All nuclei with 
84 or more protons are radioactive. Heavy 
nuclei gain stability by a series of nuclear 
disintegrations lea
