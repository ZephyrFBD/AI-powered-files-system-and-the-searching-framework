e connective tissue fibers. Gomphoses occur between teeth and their
sockets; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 29.24). The tooth is connected to the
socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament.

Cartilaginous Joints
Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints:
synchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found
in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the
connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type
of cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement.
Synovial Joints
Synovial joints are the only join
