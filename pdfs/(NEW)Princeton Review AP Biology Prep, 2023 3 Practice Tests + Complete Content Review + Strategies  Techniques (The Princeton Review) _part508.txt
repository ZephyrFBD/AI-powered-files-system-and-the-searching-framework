LAB 4: DIFFUSION AND OSMOSIS
This lab investigates the process of diffusion and osmosis in a semipermeable membrane as well as the effects of
solute concentration and water potential on these processes.
What are the general concepts you really need to know?
Fortunately, this lab covers the same concepts about diffusion and osmosis that are discussed in this book. Just
remember that osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane, from a region of high water
concentration to one of low water concentration, or from a hypotonic region (low solute concentration) to a
hypertonic region (high solute concentration).
Be familiar with the concept of water potential, which is simply the free energy of water. It is a measure of the
tendency of water to diffuse across a membrane. Water moves across a selectively permeable membrane from
an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential.
