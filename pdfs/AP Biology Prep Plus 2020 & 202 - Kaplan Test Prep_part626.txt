ppercase letters for dominant alleles (B) and lowercase letters for
recessive alleles (b). If blue eye color is the dominant allele (indicated as
B) and green eye color is the recessive allele (indicated as b), an oﬀspring
could have one of three diﬀerent genotypes (BB, Bb, and bb) when its
parents’ gametes combine. The phenotype of an oﬀspring with the
genotype BB is blue eyes. An oﬀspring with the genotype Bb will also
have blue eyes because the blue eye color allele is dominant. Only
oﬀspring with the genotype bb will have a green eye phenotype.
The diagram above shows a cell from an animal with one allele for blue
eye color (B) and one allele for green eye color (b). This animal’s genotype
for eye color is Bb, and its phenotype is blue eyes because the blue eye
color allele is dominant. The chromosomes are essentially identical in
appearance, but the alleles have a slightly diﬀerent DNA code.
The figure above shows chromosomes aȇer DNA replication. The DNA
