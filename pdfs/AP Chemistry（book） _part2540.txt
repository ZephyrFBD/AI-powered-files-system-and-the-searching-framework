Measuring ph
The pH of a solution can be measured with a pH meter (Figure 16.7). A complete under-
standing of how this important device works requires knowledge of electrochemistry, 
a subject we take up in Chapter 20. In brief, a pH meter consists of a pair of electrodes 
connected to a meter capable of measuring small voltages, on the order of millivolts. 
A voltage, which varies with pH, is generated when the electrodes are placed in a solu-
tion. This voltage is read by the meter, which is calibrated to give pH.
Although less precise, acid–base in
