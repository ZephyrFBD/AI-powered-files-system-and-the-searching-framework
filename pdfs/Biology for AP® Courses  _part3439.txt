brane potentials of GnRH
expressing neurons. The researchers (Cimino et al., Nature
Communications, 7, 2016) found that very small
concentrations of AMH initiated oscillations.
B. The graph illustrates the time dependence of LH and
estrogen in the blood of a female. A goal of research in
human reproductive physiology is to construct a model
that accounts for the spike in luteinizing hormone at
approximately 14 days. Predict how a positive feedback
loop involving the release of a hormone such as AMH
could be used to account for this response. Explain why
estrogen is probably not a good candidate for use in this
model.

FSH and LH inhibit production of GnRH. Exposure of
ovarian follicles to high levels of FSH and LH causes the
follicle to rupture, releasing an oocyte to the oviduct. Birth
control drugs suppress the LH surge by maintaining a
constant blood concentration of progesterone (PG). After
40 years of use, the mechanism of suppression is still
unknown. However, we do k
