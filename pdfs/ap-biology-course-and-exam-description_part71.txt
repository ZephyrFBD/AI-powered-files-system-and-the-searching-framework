nomers and the 
type of bonds that connect 
the monomers in biological 
macromolecules.
SYI-1.B
Bullet Lipids are nonpolar macromolecules—
 i. Differences in saturation determine the 
structure and function of lipids. 
ii. Phospholipids contain polar regions that 
interact with other polar molecules, such 
as water, and with nonpolar regions that 
are often hydrophobic.

SYI-1.C.1
Directionality of the subcomponents influences 
structure and function of the polymer—
BulletNucleic acids have a linear sequence of 
nucleotides that have ends, defined by the 3’ 
hydroxyl and 5’ phosphates of the sugar in the 
nucleotide. During DNA and RNA synthesis, 
nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the 
growing strand, resulting in the formation of a 
covalent bond between nucleotides.
