50. What part of cell membranes gives flexibility to the
structure?
a.
carbohydrates
b.
cytoskeleton filaments
c.

51. How do the differences in amino acid sequences lead
to different protein functions?
a.
Different amino acids produce different proteins
based on the bonds formed between them.
b.
Differences in amino acids lead to the recycling
of proteins, which produces other functional
proteins.
c.
Different amino acids cause rearrangements of
amino acids to produce a functional protein.
d.
Differences in the amino acids cause post-
translational modification of the protein, which
reassembles to produce a functional protein.
