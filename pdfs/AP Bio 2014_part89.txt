The results 
are presented in the graph below. Note that higher light-
penetration values indicate a greater amount of light reaching 
the water at that depth. 
According to the data above, what is the deepest water  
level at which light penetration is expected to be at least

125. An experiment on plant defenses was conducted 
on three identical groups of lima bean plants. The

plus chemical). The second group was treated 
with only the solvent used in the first treatment. 
The third group was left untreated. One week after 
the treatment phase, the numbers of carnivorous 
ants (predators of herbivores) found residing on 
the plants in each group were determined. The
