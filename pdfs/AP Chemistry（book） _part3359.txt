r positron emission or electron capture because both decays increase the 
number of neutrons and decrease the number of protons (Equations 21.5 and 21.7). 
Positron emission is more common among lighter nuclei. Electron capture becomes 
increasingly common as the nuclear charge increases.
3. Nuclei with atomic numbers # 84. These heavy nuclei tend to undergo alpha 
emission, which decreases both the number of neutrons and the number of protons 
by two, moving the nucleus diagonally toward the belt of stability.
Predict the mode of decay of (a) carbon-14, (b) xenon-118.
Sample Exercise 21.3 
Predicting Modes of Nuclear Decay
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to predict the modes of decay of two nuclei.
Plan To do this, we must locate the respective nuclei in Figure 21.1 
and determine their positions with respect to the belt of stability 
in order to predict the most likely mode of decay.
Solve
(a) Carbon is element 6. Thus, carbon-14 has 6 protons and 
14 - 6 = 8 neutrons, giving it a neut
