translation in eukaryotes will use the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules
that are ready to be translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic
genes.
RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the
5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre- RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation;
they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs
have a variety of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.
A scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is
expressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, α-amanitin (Table 15.1). Interestingly, α-amanitin produced
by Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the three polymerase
