y that
remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organismsâ€™ respiration and heat loss. The net productivity is then
available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level. In our Silver Spring example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr
were used for respiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,632 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers.
Ecological Efficiency: The Transfer of Energy between Trophic Levels
As illustrated in Figure 37.8, large amounts of energy are lost from the ecosystem from one trophic level to the next level
as energy flows from the primary producers through the various trophic levels of consumers and decomposers. The main
reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy is converted from one form to
another, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system. In biologic systems, this means a great deal of energy
is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level co
