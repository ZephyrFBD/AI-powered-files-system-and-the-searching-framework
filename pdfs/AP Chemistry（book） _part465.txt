 astronauts. The hydroxide reacts 
with the carbon dioxide to form solid lithium carbonate and  
liquid water. How many grams of carbon dioxide can be absorbed  
by 1.00 g of lithium hydroxide?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a verbal description of a reaction and asked 
to calculate the number of grams of one reactant that reacts with 
1.00 g of another.
Plan The verbal description of the reaction can be used to write a 
balanced equation:
2 LiOH1s2 + CO21g2 ยก Li2CO31s2 + H2O1l2
We are given the mass in grams of LiOH and asked to calculate 
the mass in grams of CO2. We can accomplish this with the three 
conversion steps in Figure 3.16. The conversion of Step 1 requires 
the molar mass of LiOH 16.94 + 16.00 + 1.01 = 23.95 g>mol2. 
The conversion of Step 2 is based on a stoichiometric relationship 
from the balanced chemical equation: 2 mol LiOH ] 1 mol CO2. 
For the Step 3 conversion, we use the molar mass of 
CO2 : 12.01 + 2116.002 = 44.01 g>mol.
Solve
11.00 g LiOH2a 1 mol LiOH
23.95 g
