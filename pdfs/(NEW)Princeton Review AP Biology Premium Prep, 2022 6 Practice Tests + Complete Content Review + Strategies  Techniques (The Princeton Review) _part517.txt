CHAPTER 4 DRILL: CHEMISTRY OF LIFE
1.
C
Water has many unique properties that favor life, including (A), a high specific heat, (B), high surface
tension and cohesive properties, and (D), high intermolecular forces due to hydrogen bonding. However,
water is a very polar molecule and is an excellent solvent, making (C) inaccurate and the correct answer.
2.
B
The pH scale is logarithmically based, meaning that each difference of 1 on the log scale is indicative of a
tenfold difference in the hydrogen (H+) ion concentration. According to the question, the pH values of the
cytoplasm of cells and gastric juices are approximately 7.4 and 1.5, respectively. Therefore, the pH values
vary by 6, and the hydrogen (H+) ion concentrations
