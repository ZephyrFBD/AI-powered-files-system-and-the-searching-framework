ere is evidence that the level of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has not always been the same over the history 
of life on Earth. Explain how the presence of a higher or lower concentration of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide would impact the evolution of stomata density in 
plants. 
h. Based on the data in the following table, is there a relationship between the 
habitat (in terms of moisture) to which the plants are adapted and the density of 
stomata in their leaves? What evidence from the data supports your answer?

Step 2 Make a wet mount of a nail polish stomatal peel to view leaf epidermis using the 
following technique: 
a. Obtain a leaf. (The leaf may remain on the pl
