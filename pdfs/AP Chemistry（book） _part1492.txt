d 2p atomic orbitals of different atoms.
The molecular orbital description of period 2 diatomic mole-
cules leads to bond orders in accord with the Lewis structures of these 
molecules. Further, the model predicts correctly that O2 should ex-
hibit paramagnetism, which leads to attraction of a molecule into a 
magnetic field due to the influence of unpaired electrons. Molecules 
in which all the electrons are paired exhibit diamagnetism, which 
leads to weak repulsion from a magnetic field. The molecular orbit-
als of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are often closely related to 
those of homonuclear diatomic molecules.
