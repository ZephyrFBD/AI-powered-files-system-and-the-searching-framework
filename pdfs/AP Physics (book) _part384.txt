Elevator and counterweight (Atwood machine). A system
of two objects suspended over a pulley by a flexible cable, as shown in Fig. 4–23a,
is sometimes referred to as an Atwood machine. Consider the real-life appli-
cation of an elevator 
and its counterweight 
To minimize the work
done by the motor to raise and lower the elevator safely,

are made
similar in mass. We leave the motor out of the system for this calculation, and
assume that the cable’s mass is negligible and that the mass of
