with epiphytes, photosynthetic plants that
grow on other trees rather than supporting themselves. They are not
parasites but may kill the trees inadvertently by blocking the light.
Tropical rainforests house the most diverse animal species of any

Desert
Deserts have less than 10 inches (25 cm) of rainfall per year; not
even grasses can survive.
Deserts experience the most extreme temperature fluctuations of
any biome. Daytime surface temperatures can be as high as 158°F
(70°C). With no moderating influence of vegetation, heat is lost
