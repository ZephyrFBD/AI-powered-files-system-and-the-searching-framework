 Mr. MacAdorey tells Dad there’s work with the WPA and when he 
 
 gets the work there’s money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean 
 
 the twins and to feed us.When Dad comes home with the drink smell 
 
 there’s no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and 
 
 Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls 
 
 back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland.Why doesn’t 
 
 he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister 
 
 who died? Why doesn’t he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry 
 
 Mam’s tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our 
 
 shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the 
 
 twins promise to die for Ireland but they can’t even talk and Mam 
 
 screamed at him,You mad oul’ bastard, can’t you leave the children 
 
 alone? 
 
 He’ll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland 
 
 and we promise but we never get the nickel. 
 
 We get soup
