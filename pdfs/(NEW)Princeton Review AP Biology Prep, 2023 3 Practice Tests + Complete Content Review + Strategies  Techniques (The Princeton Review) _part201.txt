to dilute the concentrated solute particles.
When discussing osmosis, the situation is often described such that there are two areas and the water can flow freely,
but the solute cannot. For example, if a chamber containing water and a chamber containing a sucrose solution are
connected by a semipermeable membrane that allows water but not sucrose to cross, diffusion of sucrose between
the chambers cannot occur. In this case, osmosis draws water into the sucrose chamber to reduce the sucrose
concentration. This will reduce the total volume of the water chamber. Water will flow into the sucrose chamber
until the concentration is the same across the membrane.
In both diffusion and osmosis, the final result is that solute concentrations are the same on both sides of the
membrane. The only difference is that in diffusion the membrane is usually permeable to solute, and in osmosis it is
not.
In plants, the cell wall is important to protect it against osmotic changes. The cell wall stays rel
