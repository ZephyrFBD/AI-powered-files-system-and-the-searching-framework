2+. 
This prediction is consistent with the spectrochemical series because 
Cl- ligands are at the low end of the spectrochemical series. Thus re-
placing NH3 with Cl- should make âˆ† smaller.
Sample Exercise 23.8
Practice Exercise 2: No it is not possible to have a diamagnetic com-
plex with partially filled d orbitals if the complex is high spin, and all 
tetrahedral complexes are high spin.
