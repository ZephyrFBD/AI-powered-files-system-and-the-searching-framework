 3. In fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), straight wing shape is dominant to curly wing shape. A particular 
population of fruit flies is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the alleles for wing shape. 
 
  The Hardy-Weinberg equation, given below, is useful in understanding population genetics: 
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 
(a) Explain what the terms ( p2, 2pq, and q2 ) represent in the population of fruit flies. 
(b) Describe one condition that is necessary for the population to be in equilibrium.
