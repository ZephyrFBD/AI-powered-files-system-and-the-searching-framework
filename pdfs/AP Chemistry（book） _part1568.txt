t pressure  
is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.
Thus, doubling the absolute temperature causes the gas volume to double. Mathemati-
cally, Charles’s law takes the form
 
V = constant * T or V
T = constant 
[10.3]
with the value of the constant depending on the pressure and on the amount of gas.

of different gases have the same number of molecules but different masses.
The Quantity–Volume Relationship: Avogadro’s Law
The relationship between the quantity of a gas and its volume follows from the work of 
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1823) and Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856).
Gay-Lussac was one of those extraordinary figures in
