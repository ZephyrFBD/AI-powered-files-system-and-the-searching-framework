knight in this condition, Faustus removed the horns. When Faustus, having
taken leave of the emperor, was a league and a half from the city, he was
attacked in a wood by the knight and some of his companions:  they were
in armour, and mounted on fair palfreys; but the doctor quickly overcame
them by turning all the bushes into horsemen, and "so charmed them, that
every one, knight and other, for the space of a whole moneth, did weare a
paire of goates hornes on their browes, and every palfry a paire of oxe
hornes on his head; and this was their penance appointed by Faustus."  A
second attempt of the knight to revenge himself on Faustus proved equally
unsuccessful.  Sigs. G 2, I 3, ed. 1648.">
