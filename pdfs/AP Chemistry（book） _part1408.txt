two Be ¬F bonds to 
form, we still have not explained the structure of BeF2.
We can solve this dilemma by “mixing” the 2s orbital with one 2p orbital to generate 
two new orbitals, as shown in Figure 9.14. Like p orbitals, each new orbital has two lobes. 
Unlike p orbitals, however, one lobe is much larger than the other. The two new orbitals 
are identical in shape, but their large lobes point in opposite directions. These two new 
orbitals, which are shown in purple in Figure 9.14, are hybrid orbitals. Because we have 
hybridized one s and one p orbital, we call each hybrid an sp hybrid orbital. According to 
the valence-bond model, a linear arrangement of electron domains implies sp hybridization.
For the Be atom of BeF2, we write the orbital diagram for the formation of two sp 
hybrid orbitals as
sp
2p
1s
The electrons in the sp hybrid orbitals can form bonds with the two fluorine atoms 
(Figure 9.15). Because the sp hybrid orbitals are equivalent but point in opposite direc-
