increase in mo-
tional freedom accompanies vaporization and ∆S is positive.
(b) In this process, ions, which are free to move throughout 
the volume of the solution, form a solid, in which they are 
conﬁned to a smaller volume and restricted to more highly 
constrained positions. Thus, ∆S is negative.
(c) The particles of a solid are conﬁned to speciﬁc locations and 
have fewer ways to move (fewer microstates) than do the 
molecules of a gas. Because O2 gas is converted into part of the 
solid product Fe2O3, ∆S is negative.
(d) The number of moles of reactant gases is the same as the 
number of moles of product gases, and so the entropy change 
is expected to be small. The sign of ∆S is impossible to predict 
based on our discussions thus far, but we can predict that ∆S 
will be close to zero.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Indicate whether each process produces an increase or 
decrease in the entropy of the system:
(a) CO21s2 ¡ CO21g2
(b) CaO1s2 + CO21g2 ¡ CaCO31s2
(c)  HCl1g2 + NH31g2 ¡ NH4C
