next—it is called 
an intermediate. Multistep mechanisms involve one or more inter-
mediates. Intermediates are not the same as transition states, as shown 
in Figure 14.19. Intermediates can be stable and can therefore sometimes 
be identified and even isolated. Transition states, on the other hand, are 
always inherently unstable and as such can never be isolated. Neverthe-
less, the use of advanced “ultrafast” techniques sometimes allows us to 
characterize them.

It has been proposed that the conversion of ozone into O2 proceeds by a two-step mechanism:
O31g2 ¡ O21g2 + O1g2
O31g2 + O1g2 ¡ 2 O21g2
