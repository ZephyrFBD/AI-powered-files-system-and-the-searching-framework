taken to try and restore the free energy to an
acceptable level?
Section Summary
Energy comes in many different forms. Objects in motion do physical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects
in motion. Objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work, and thus, have potential energy. Molecules
also have potential energy because the breaking of molecular bonds has the potential to release energy. Living cells depend
on the harvesting of potential energy from molecular bonds to perform work. Free energy is a measure of energy that is
available to do work. The free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as chemical reactions, and this
change is referred to as ∆G.
The ∆G of a reaction can be negative or positive, meaning that the reaction releases energy or consumes energy, respectively.
A reaction with a negative ∆G that gives off energy is called an exergonic reaction. One with a positive ∆G that requires
energy input is called an endergonic react
