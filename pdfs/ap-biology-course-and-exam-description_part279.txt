ommunicate information, make predictions, and 
describe systems to demonstrate their understanding. 
Students should also use and apply visual 
representations to make predictions and address 
scientific questions, as well as interpret and create 
graphs drawn from experimental data.

Science Practice 3: Questions and Methods (cont'd)
Science Practice 3: Determine scientific questions and methods.
To provide deeper understanding of the concepts, 
students should be able to pose, refine, and evaluate 
scientific questions about natural phenomena and 
investigate answers through experimentation, research, 
and information gathering and discussion. Suppose a 
student poses the question: “What happens to the rate 
of photosynthesis at very high temperatures?” This 
question can be addressed in a variety of ways, using 
literature searches, fact f
