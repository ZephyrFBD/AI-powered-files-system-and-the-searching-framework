2.1.3 Newton's law of cooling
Newton's law of cooling states that when the object, which means the
thermodynamic system, cools in the natural condition, and the temperature of the
experimental system
T
is higher than the temperature of the outside 
while
T


is small, the speed of the lost heat of the system by surface radiation is
proportional to 

k is related to the area
and smoothness of the system’s surface[1].
Newton's law of cooling has its applicable condition[2]. Newton's law of cooling
can be used only when 

T

is to an extent. Some literatures make comments that
when the object cools in the natural condition, Newton's law of cooling can be used
