to a higher energy state in the atom if
its energy is not sufficient to knock the electron out altogether. In this process
the photon also disappears, and all its energy is given to the atom. Such an
atom is then said to be in an excited state, and we shall discuss it more later.
3. The photon can be scattered from an electron (or a nucleus) and in the
process lose some energy; this is the Compton effect (Fig. 27–9). But notice
that the photon is not slowed down. It still travels with speed c, but its
frequency will be lower because it has lost some energy.
4. Pair production: A photon can actually create matter, such as the production
of an electron and a positron, Fig. 27–10. (A positron has the same mass as
an electron, but the opposite charge,
)
In process 4, pair production, the photon disappears in the process of creating
the electron–positron pair. This is an example of mass being created from pure
energy, and it occurs in accord with Einstein’s equation 
Notice that a
photon ca
