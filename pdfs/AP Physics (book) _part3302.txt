ars, and now 16-nm technology
which—being only a few atoms wide—may involve new structures and quantum-
mechanical effects. Smaller means more diodes and transistors per 
and
therefore greater speed (faster response time) because the distance signals have
to travel is less. Smaller also means lower power consumption. Size, speed, and
power have all been improved 10 to 100 million times in the last 40 years.

†The “MOS” comes from a version with a Metal gate, silicon diOxide insulator, and a Semiconductor
(p-type shown in Fig. 29–42a). The gate can also be heavily doped silicon (= good conductor).
