and there is. What’s more the average age of a ‘Covid’ death is akin
to the average age that people die in general. The average age of
death in England is about 80 for men and 83 for women. The average
age of death from alleged ‘Covid’ is between 82 and 83. California
doctors, Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, said at their April media
conference that projection models of millions of deaths had been
‘woefully inaccurate’. They produced detailed ﬁgures showing that
Californians had a 0.03 chance of dying from ‘Covid’ based on the

‘Covid’ in the state of New York, not just the city, and a 0.05 percent
chance in Spain, a centre of ‘Covid-19’ hysteria at one stage. The
Stanford studies supported the doctors’ data with fatality rate
estimates of 0.23 and 0.15 percent. How close are these ﬁgures to my
