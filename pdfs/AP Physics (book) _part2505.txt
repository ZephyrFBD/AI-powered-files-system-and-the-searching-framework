behave so that we can see everything that we do? We saw in
Chapter 22 that light can be considered a form of electromagnetic radiation. We
now examine the subject of light in detail in the next three Chapters.
We see an object in one of two ways: (1) the object may be a source of light,
such as a lightbulb, a flame, or a star, in which case we see the light emitted directly
from the source; or, more commonly, (2) we see an object by light reflected from it.
In the latter case, the light may have originated from the Sun, artificial lights,
or a campfire. An understanding of how objects emit light was not achieved until
the 1920s, and will be discussed in Chapter 27. How light is reflected from objects
was understood much earlier, and will be discussed in Section 23–2.
23–1 The Ray Model of Light
A great deal of evidence suggests that light travels in straight lines under a wide vari-
ety of circumstances.† For example, a source of light like the Sun (which at its great
distance from us
