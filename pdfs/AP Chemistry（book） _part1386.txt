rigonal bipyramid can point toward two geomet-
rically distinct types of positions. Two domains point toward axial positions, and three 
point toward equatorial positions (Figure 9.8). Each axial domain makes a 90° angle with 
any equatorial domain. Each equatorial domain makes a 120° angle with either of the 
other two equatorial domains and a 90° angle with either axial domain.
Suppose a molecule has five electron domains, and there are one or more nonbond-
ing pairs. Will the domains from the nonbonding pairs occupy axial or equatorial posi-
tions? To answer this question, we must determine which location minimizes repulsion 
between domains. Repulsion between two domains is much greater when they are situ-
ated 90° from each other than when they are at 120°. An equatorial domain is 90° from 
only two other domains (the axial domains), but an axial domain is 90° from three other 
domains (the equatorial domains). Hence, an equatorial domain experiences less repul-
sion than an axial
