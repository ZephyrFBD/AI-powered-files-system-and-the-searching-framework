those factors do you think could affect enzyme activity? How would you 
modify your basic assay to test your hypothesis? 
Students already have the basic assay needed to explore enzymes in different 
environments. They need only to develop a hypothesis and decide how to vary the basic 
experimental procedures to answer the question above. Then students perform the 
experiment(s) and report whether their results support or contradict their hypotheses. 
(It is not recommended that students pursue the role of inhibitors in enzymatic 
reactions. Many inhibitors will also work on the humanâ€™s enzymatic networks, so you do 
not want students to handle inhibitors in the laboratory.) 
Sample results for investigations that students might choose to explore are shown in 
the following figures and tables. Figure 3 shows a typical color palette for the effect of 
different temperatures or enzyme concentration on peroxidase activity.
