THE SEARCH FOR HERITABLE MATERIAL
Frederick Griffith (1928) performed experiments with several different
strains of the bacterium Diplococcus pneumoniae. Some strains are
virulent and cause pneumonia in humans and mice, and some strains are
harmless. Griffith discovered that bacteria have the ability to transform
harmless cells into virulent ones by transferring some genetic factor from
one bacteria cell to another. This phenomenon is known as bacterial
transformation, and the experiment is known as the transformation
experiment. See the information about bacterial transformation later in
this chapter.
STUDY TIP
While you may see questions that are based on these classic experiments on the AP exam, you
likely won’t be tested on the names of the scientists.
Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944) published their classic
findings that Griffith’s transformation factor is, in fact, DNA. This
research proved that DNA was the agent that carri
