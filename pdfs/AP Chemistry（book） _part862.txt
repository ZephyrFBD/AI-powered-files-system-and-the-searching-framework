04 Consider the systems shown in Figure 5.10. In one case the 
battery becomes completely discharged by running the cur-
rent through a heater, and in the other case by running a fan. 
Both processes occur at constant pressure. In both cases the 
change in state of the system is the same: The battery goes 
from being fully charged to being fully discharged. Yet in one 
case the heat evolved is large, and in the other it is small. Is 
the enthalpy change the same in the two cases? If not, how 
can enthalpy be considered a state function? If it is, what can 
you say about the relationship between enthalpy change 
and q in this case, as compared with others that we have 
considered?
 5.105 A house is designed to have passive solar energy features. 
Brickwork incorporated into the interior of the house acts 
as a heat absorber. Each brick weighs approximately 1.8 kg. 
The specific heat of the brick is 0.85 J>g@K. How many bricks 
must be incorporated into the interior of the house to pro-
