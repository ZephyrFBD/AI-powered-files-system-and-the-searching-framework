al power plant in Taylorsville, Georgia, 
burned 8,376,726 tons of coal, a national record at that 
time. (a) Assuming that the coal was 83% carbon and 2.5% 
sulfur and that combustion was complete, calculate the 
number of tons of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide pro-
duced by the plant during the year. (b) If 55% of the SO2 
could be removed by reaction with powdered CaO to form 
CaSO3, how many tons of CaSO3 would be produced?
