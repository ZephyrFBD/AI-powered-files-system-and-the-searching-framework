possible compositions. When two metals differ in 
radii by more than about 15%, solubility is generally more limited.
For an interstitial alloy to form, the solute atoms must have a much smaller bond-
ing atomic radius than the solvent atoms. Typically, the interstitial element is a non-
metal that makes covalent bonds to the neighboring metal atoms. The presence of the 
Therefore, a diagonal across a face of the unit cell is equal to four 
times the atomic radius, r. Using simple trigonometry, and the 
identity cos145°2 = 12>2, we can show that
 
a = 4r  cos145°2 = 4r122>22 = 12222r 
Finally, we calculate the packing efficiency by dividing the vol-
ume occupied by atoms by the volume of the cubic unit cell, a3:
Packing efficiency =

Consider the two-dimensional square lattice of Figure 12.4. The 
“packing efficiency” for a two-dimensional structure would be 
the area of the atoms divid
