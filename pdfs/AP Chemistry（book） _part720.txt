s the 1 g of butane and the oxygen required to combust it. The 
combustion of butane in oxygen gives off heat, so ∆H is negative 
and the process is exothermic.

In chemistry we are interested mainly in two types of work: electri-
cal work and mechanical work done by expanding gases. We focus 
here on the latter, called pressure–volume, or P–V, work. Expanding 
gases in the cylinder of an automobile engine do P–V work on the 
piston; this work eventually turns the wheels. Expanding gases from 
an open reaction vessel do P–V work on the atmosphere. This work 
accomplishes nothing in a practical sense, but we must keep track of 
all work, useful or not, when monitoring energy changes
