both ampicillin and
tetracycline resistance. The four different plates used, and the results of this experiment, are shown in the
following figure.
(a) Describe the two enzymes that would be used to create a recombinant plasmid that contained both the
ampicillin resistance gene and the tetracycline resistance gene.
(b) Identify the plate that acts as a control to show that the untransformed bacteria were not originally resistant
to ampicillin and tetracycline.
(c) Analyze the data, and determine whether the relative numbers of bacteria colonies (seen on agar plate #3
and agar plate #4) are as expected if the bacterial transformation procedure was successful.
(d) Bacteria are removed from plate #4 and are allowed to grow in nutrient medium. Bacteria that contain the
F+ (fertility) plasmid can undergo the process of conjugation and transfer some of their DNA to other
bacterial cells. Predict the result if bacteria (that were resistant to streptomycin and contained the F+
plasmid) were us
