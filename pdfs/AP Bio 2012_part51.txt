 discovered, 
chemically different antibiotic is used in place of 
methicillin. Which of the following would be the 
most likely effect on Staphylococcus aureus 
antibiotic resistance? 
(A) The gene for methicillin resistance, no longer 
needed, would disappear entirely from 
Staphylococcus aureus populations within a 
few generations. 
(B) Transmission of the methicillin-resistance 
plasmid by conjugation would increase 
among the Staphylococcus aureus 
population as the genes would confer 
resistance to the new antibiotic. 
(C) Transmission of the methicillin-resistance 
plasmid would gradually decrease but the 
plasmid would not entirely disappear from 
the Staphylococcus aureus population. 
(D) Transmission of the methicillin-resistance 
plasmid by conjugation would increase 
among the Staphylococcus aureus 
population due to destruction of bacteria 
without the plasmid through use of the new 
antibiotic.
