ene glycol has an 
Â¬OH group at both ends of the molecule. This greatly increases the 
possibilities for hydrogen bonding; the overall intermolecular attrac-
tive forces are greater and the viscosity of ethylene glycol is much 
greater. (c) Water has the highest surface tension but lowest viscosity 
because it is the smallest molecule in the series. There is no hydro-
carbon chain to inhibit their strong attraction to molecules in the 
interior of the drop, resulting in high surface tension. The absence 
of an alkyl chain also means the molecules can move around each 
other easily, resulting in the low viscosity. 11.39 (a) Melting, endo-
