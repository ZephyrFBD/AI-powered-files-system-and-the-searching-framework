form of
triglycerides, for energy metabolism. Adipose tissues additionally serve as insulation to help maintain body temperatures,
allowing animals to be endothermic, and they function as cushioning against damage to body organs. Under a microscope,
adipose tissue cells appear empty due to the extraction of fat during the processing of the material for viewing, as seen in
Figure 24.16. The thin lines in the image are the cell membranes, and the nuclei are the small, black dots at the edges of the
cells.

localized at the cell edge.
Blood
Blood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix, as shown in Figure 24.17. The living cell types are red
blood cells (RBC), also called erythrocytes, and white blood cells (WBC), also called leukocytes. The fluid portion of whole
blood, its matrix, is commonly called pl
