rticle-like behaviors of the electron. His work opened a new approach to dealing 
with subatomic particles, an approach known as quantum mechanics or wave mechan-
ics. The application of Schrödinger’s equation requires advanced calculus, and so we 
will not be concerned with its details. We will, however, qualitatively consider the 
results Schrödinger obtained because they give us a powerful new way to view elec-
tronic structure. Let’s begin by examining the electronic structure of the simplest 
atom, hydrogen.
Schrödinger treated the electron in a hydrogen atom like the wave on a plucked gui-
tar string (Figure 6.16). Because such waves do not travel in space, they are called standing 
waves. Just as the plucked guitar string produces a standing wave that has a fundamen-
tal frequency and higher overtones (harmonics), the electron exhibits a  
lowest-energy 
Do the implications of the uncertainty principle become more or less important as 
the mass of an object increases?
