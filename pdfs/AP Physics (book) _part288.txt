al and can be extended to three or more
velocities. For example, if a fisherman on the boat walks with a velocity 
rela-
tive to the boat, his velocity relative to the shore is  
The
equations involving relative velocity will be correct when adjacent inner subscripts
are identical and when the outermost ones correspond exactly to the two on the
velocity on the left of the equation. But this works only with plus signs (on the
right), not minus signs.
It is often useful to remember that for any two objects or reference frames,
A and B, the velocity of A relative to B has the same magnitude, but opposite
direction, as the velocity of B relative to A:
(3;8)
For example, if a train is traveling 
relative to the Earth in a certain
direction, objects on the Earth (such as trees) appear to an observer on the train
to be traveling 
in the opposite direction.
