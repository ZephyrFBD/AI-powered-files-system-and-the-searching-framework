Transpiration is the loss of water from a leaf. The transpirational pull–
cohesion tension theory explains that as one molecule of water evaporates
from a leaf by transpiration, another molecule of water is pulled into the
plant through the roots. An increase in sunlight increases the rate of
transpiration (by causing more water to evaporate from the leaves) and
also increases the rate of photosynthesis. Other environmental conditions
that increase photosynthesis and transpiration are wind and low humidity.

In this lab, you will measure the rate of transpiration in a plant under

various conditions in a controlled experiment.
Insert two-week-old bean seedlings (Phaseolus vulgaris) into a
potometer, and measure the amount of water used by the plants under
varying conditions of humidity (misting the leaves), light (a strong light
bulb shining on the plant), and wind (a fan). Set up several potometers:
one for each variable a
