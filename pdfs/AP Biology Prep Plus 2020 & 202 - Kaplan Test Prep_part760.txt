he
chicken egg evolved at the same time,” it would have been correct. (D)
is wrong because a conclusion can be drawn.
5. C
Learning Objective: 17.3
(C) This explanation requires the fewest changes to occur in the
evolutionary history of all of the species shown and is therefore the
best choice. (A) and (B) each require more changes to have occurred
during the evolutionary history of all of the species shown in order to
result in the pattern shown. Therefore, these choices are incorrect. (D)
is incorrect because a conclusion can be drawn from the data
presented.
6. D
Learning Objective: 17.1
(D) Since the two phylogenetic trees don’t match, we know that there
are diﬀerences. Additional studies might reveal changes that could
resolve the diﬀerences so that the trees would match. The fact that the
trees don’t correspond to each other makes (A) incorrect. Since the
actual phylogenetic relatedness of the firefly species is not known, it is
impossible to know whether the molecular analysis o
