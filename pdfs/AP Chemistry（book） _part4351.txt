their abilities to increase the crystal-field splitting energy. 
(Section 23.6)
spectrum The distribution among various wavelengths of the 
radiant energy emitted or absorbed by an object. (Section 6.3)
spin magnetic quantum number 1ms2 A quantum number 
associated with the electron spin; it may have values of +1
2 or -1
2. 
(Section 6.7)
spin-pairing energy The difference between the energy 
required to pair an electron in an occupied orbital and the 
energy required to place that electron in an empty orbital. 
(Section 23.6)
spontaneous process A process that is capable of proceeding 
in a given direction, as written or described, without needing 
to be driven by an outside source of energy. A process may be 
spontaneous even though it is very slow. (Section 19.1)
standard atmospheric pressure Defined as 760 torr or, in SI 
units, 101.325 kPa. (Section 10.2)
standard emf, also called the standard cell potential 1E°2 The 
emf of a cell when all reagents are at standard conditions.
