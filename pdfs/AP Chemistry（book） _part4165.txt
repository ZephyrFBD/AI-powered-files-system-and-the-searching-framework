eight. page 173 No. If ∆V is zero, then the expression w = -P∆V 
is also zero. page 174 ∆H is positive; the fact that the flask (part 
of the surroundings) gets cold means that the system is absorbing 
heat, meaning that qP is positive. (See Figure 5.8.) Because the pro-
cess occurs at constant pressure, qp = ∆H. page 176 No. Because 
only half as much matter is involved, the value of ∆H would be

21-483.6 kJ2 = -241.8 kJ. page 179 Hg(l). Rearranging Equation 
5.22 gives ∆T =
q
Cs * m. When q and m are constant for a series of 
substances, then ∆T = constant
Cs
. Therefore, the element with the 
smallest Cs in Table 5.2 has the largest ∆T, Hgl. page 184 (a) The 
sign of ∆H changes. (b) The magnitude of ∆H doubles. page 188 
No. Because O31g2 is not the most stable form of oxygen at 25 °C, 1 
atm 3O21g2 is4, ∆H°
f for O31g2 is not necessarily zero. In Appendix C
