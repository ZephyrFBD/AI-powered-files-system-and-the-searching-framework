31. (III) In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, an electron
orbits a proton (the nucleus) in a circular orbit of radius
(a) What is the electric potential at the
electron’s orbit due to the proton? (b) What is the kinetic
energy of the electron? (c) What is the total energy of the
electron in its orbit? (d) What is the ionization energy—
that is, the energy required to remove the electron from the
atom and take it to
at rest? Express the results of
parts (b), (c), and (d) in joules and eV.

apart.
What is their dipole moment if they are at rest?

dipole moment is 
at a point 
away if this point is (a) along the axis of the dipol
