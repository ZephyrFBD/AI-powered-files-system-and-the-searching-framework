ped micro-devices that can latch onto intestinal mucosa and
release drugs into the body. Mucosa is the thin skin that covers the
inside surface of parts of the body such as the nose and mouth and
produces mucus to protect them. The Johns Hopkins micro-devices
are called ‘theragrippers’ and were ‘inspired’ by a parasitic worm
that digs its sharp teeth into a host’s intestines. Nasal swabs are also
coated in the sterilisation agent ethylene oxide. The US National
Cancer Institute posts this explanation on its website:
At room temperature, ethylene oxide is a flammable colorless gas with a sweet odor. It is used
primarily to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, ethylene
oxide is used as a pesticide and a sterilizing agent. The ability of ethylene oxide to damage
DNA makes it an effective sterilizing agent but also accounts for its cancer-causing activity.
The Institute mentions lymphoma and leukaemia as cancers most
frequently reported to be associated with o
