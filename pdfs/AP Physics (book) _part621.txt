te that Corinne is consistently at a lower elevation than Paul at any instant,
until the end. This means she has converted her potential energy to kinetic energy
earlier. Consequently, she is traveling faster than Paul for the whole trip, and
because the distance is the same, Corinne gets to the bottom first.

wo kinds of potential energy. A ball of mass
starting from rest, falls a vertical distance
before striking a 
vertical coiled spring, which it compresses an amount  
(Fig. 6â€“23).
Determine the spring stiffness constant k of the spring. Assume the spring has
negligible mass, and ignore air resistance. Measure all distances from the point
where the ball first touches the uncompressed spring (
at this point).
APPROACH The forces acting on the ball are the gravitational pull of the
Earth and the elastic force exerted by the spring. Both forces are conservative,
so we can use conservation of mechanical energy, including both types of poten-
tial
