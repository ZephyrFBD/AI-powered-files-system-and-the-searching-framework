e triphosphate (ATP) in cellular metabolism by the
involvement of a proton gradient across a membrane
(also, Krebs cycle) series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions of central importance in all living
cells
removal of a phosphate group from a molecule
process of regenerating NAD+ with either an inorganic or organic compound serving as the final electron
acceptor; occurs in the absence of oxygen
integral membrane protein that transports glucose
process of breaking glucose into two three-carbon molecules with the production of ATP and NADH
enzyme that converts a molecule into its isomer
(also, citric acid cycle) alternate name for the citric acid cycle, named after Hans Krebs who first identified
the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles; see citric acid cycle
production of ATP using the process of chemiosmosis and oxygen
addition of a high-energy phosphate to a compound, usually a metabolic intermediate, a protein, or
ADP
(also, prosthetic cofactor) molecule boun
