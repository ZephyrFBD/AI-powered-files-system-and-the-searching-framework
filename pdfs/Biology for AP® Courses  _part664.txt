ated with something as simple
as an object held above the ground. In order to appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is
important to understand more about the different types of energy that exist in the physical world.
Types of Energy
When an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. In the example of an airplane in flight, there is a
great deal of energy associated with the motion of the airplane. This is because moving objects are capable of enacting a
change, or doing work. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other
objects. However, a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work. Energy associated with objects in
motion is called kinetic energy. A speeding bullet, a walking person, the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which

produces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy.
Now what if
