manipulate the formula in your spreadsheet that determines whether or not an individual passes on its alleles to the
next generation. To simulate selection against BB individuals, for example, adjust the formula that counts the
number of BB individuals that contribute gametes to the next generation. In the spreadsheet in Figure 17-2, if no
selection occurs, then the number of BB individuals is calculated in cell G261 with the following formula:
2*SUM(G5:G254) + SUM(F5:F254)
 
If only 50% of the BB individuals survive, the formula becomes the following:
 
05*2*SUM(G5:G254) + SUM(F5:F254) The formulas for all the cells are shown in Figure 17-3.

4. Investigate the effect of mutation and gene flow. You can simulate a mutation of A to B or B to A in ways
similar to an investigation of natural selection, above.
By manipulating your population model, you should make the following conclusions:
 
1. The frequencies of alleles should remain unchanged over time unless one
