CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4;1
Inertial Reference Frames
Newton’s first law does not hold in every reference frame. For example, if your
reference frame is an accelerating car, an object such as a cup resting on the 
dashboard may begin to move toward you (it stayed at rest as long as the car’s
velocity remained constant). The cup accelerated toward you, but neither you nor
anything else exerted a force on it in that direction. Similarly, in the reference frame
of the decelerating bus in Example 4–1, there was no force pushing the backpacks
forward. In accelerating reference frames, Newton’s first law does not hold. Physics
is easier in reference frames in which Newton’s first law does hold, and they 
are called inertial reference frames (the law of inertia is valid in them). For most
purposes, we usually make the approximation that a reference frame fixed on the
Earth is an inertial frame. This is not precisely true, due to the Earth’s rotation,
but usually it is clo
