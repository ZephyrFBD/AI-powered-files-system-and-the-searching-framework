0-52, 
so we know pKa 1pKa = -log Ka = 4.742. 
We know the initial concentrations of 
the base, sodium acetate, and the acid, 
acetic acid, which we will assume are the 
same as the equilibrium concentrations.
In Sample Exercise 17.3 we calculated the pH of a buffered solution. Often we will need 
to work in the opposite direction by calculating the amounts of the acid and its conjugate 
base needed to achieve a specific pH. This calculation is illustrated in Sample Exercise 17.5.
How many moles of NH4Cl must be added to 2.0 L of 0.10 M NH3 to form a buffer whose pH is 9.00? (Assume that the addition 
of NH4Cl does not change the volume of the solution.)
Sample Exercise 17.5 
Preparing a Buffer
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the amount of NH4
+ ion re-
quired to prepare a buffer of a specific pH.
Plan The major species in the solution will be NH4
+, Cl-, and 
NH3. Of these, the Cl- ion is a spectator (it is the conjugate base 
of a strong acid). Thus, the NH4
+>NH3 conjugat
