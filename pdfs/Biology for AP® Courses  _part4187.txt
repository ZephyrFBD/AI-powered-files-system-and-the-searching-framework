ink About It
Many endemic species are found in areas that are geographically isolated. What is a possible scientific explanation for
this observation? Justify your answer.
Lab Investigation
Use The College Board Advanced Placement Program: Measuring Primary Productivityâ€”Grass Plants:
Student Lab Template, found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32grass) to explore the concept of
primary productivity versus gross productivity. You will calculate primary productivity, be introduced to the
benefits of measuring dry mass versus wet mass, and make predictions about the changes in net primary
productivity based on the variables you decide to focus on.
To learn more about calculating net primary productivity, watch this video (https://openstaxcollege.org/l/
