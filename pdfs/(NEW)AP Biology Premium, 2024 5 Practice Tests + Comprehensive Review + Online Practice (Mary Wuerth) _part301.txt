Problems that Involve a Dihybrid Cross
A dihybrid cross looks at the result when two organisms (that are both heterozygous for the same two traits) are
crossed. When solving dihybrid crosses, math is your friend! Treat each trait separately, find the probabilities of
each outcome for each trait, and use the laws of probability to solve the problem.
Refer to the Appendix of this book for the relevant probability equations (and those same equations will be supplied to you on test day). The
probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities:
Try the following example. Two pea plants that are both heterozygous for purple flower color and plant height
are crossed. The genotypes of the parents are PpTt × PpTt.
Recall from the monohybrid cross of Pp × Pp (Figure 13.1) that the probability
