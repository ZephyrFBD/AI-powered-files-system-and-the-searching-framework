sorbers like cadmium or boron), whose
function is to absorb neutrons and maintain the reactor at just barely “critical,”
The release of neutrons and subsequent fissions occur so quickly that
manipulation of the control rods to maintain 
would not be possible if it
weren’t for the small percentage 
of so-called delayed neutrons.
They come from the decay of neutron-rich fission fragments (or their daughters)
having lifetimes on the order of seconds—sufficient to allow enough reaction
time to operate the control rods and maintain
Nuclear reactors have been built for use in research and to produce electric
power. Fission produces many neutrons and a “research reactor” is basically an
intense source of neutrons. These neutrons can be used as projectiles in nuclear
reactions to produce nuclides not found in nature, including isotopes used as
tracers and for therapy. A “power reactor” is used to produce electric power.
