further current flow, and no potential difference across the resistor. The potential
difference 
across the capacitor, which is proportional to the charge on it
(
Eq. 17–7), thus increases in time as shown in Fig. 19–20b. The shape
of this curve is a type of exponential, and is given by the formula†
(19;7a)
where we use the subscript C to remind us that 
is the voltage across the
capacitor and is given here as a function of time t. [The constant e, known as the
base for natural logarithms, has the value
Do not confuse this e with
e for the charge on the electron.]
We can write a similar formula for the charge Q
on the capacitor:
(19;7b)
where 
represents the maximum charge.
The product of the resistance R times the capacitance C, which appears in
the exponent, is called the time constant
of the circuit:
(19;7c)
The time constant is a measure of how quickly the capacitor becomes charged.
[The units of RC are
] Specifically, it 
can be shown that the product RC gives the time required
