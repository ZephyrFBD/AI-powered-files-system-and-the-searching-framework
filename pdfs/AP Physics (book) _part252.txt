Using Eqs. 3–3, we can calculate 
and 
for any vector, such as that illus-
trated in Fig. 3–10 or Fig. 3–12. Suppose 
represents a displacement of 500 m in
a direction 30° north of east, as shown in Fig. 3–13. Then
From a
calculator or Tables,
and
Then
There are two ways to specify a vector in a given coordinate system:
1. We can give its components,
and 
2. We can give its magnitude V and the angle it makes with the positive x axis.
We can shift from one description to the other using Eqs. 3–3, and, for the reverse,
by using the theorem of Pythagoras† and the definition of tangent:
(3;4a)
(3;4b)
as can be seen in Fig. 3–12.
Adding Vectors
We can now discuss how to add vectors using components. The first step is to
resolve each vector into its components. Next we can see, using Fig. 3
