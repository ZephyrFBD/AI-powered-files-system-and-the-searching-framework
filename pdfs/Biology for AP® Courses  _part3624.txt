pacity and delivery.
Carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 30.20). When carbon
dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO3
−) and hydrogen ions (H+). As the level of carbon
dioxide in the blood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent
decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the
oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level
as when the pH was higher. A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased
temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced.
Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen-
carrying capacity.
