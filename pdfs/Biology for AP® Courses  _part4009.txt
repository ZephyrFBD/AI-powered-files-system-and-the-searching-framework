response. The labels A, B,
and C need to be replaced with the names of the cells
involved. Which set of cells correctly completes this
diagram?
a.
A = infected host cell, B = pathogen, C =
healthy host cell
b.
A = healthy host cell, B = pathogen, C =
dendritic cell
c.
A = dendritic cell, B = infected host cell, C =
pathogen
d.
A = pathogen, B = dendritic cell, C = healthy
host cell
46. A healthy person produces antibodies to pathogens that
invade the body. However, if this person becomes infected
with HIV, the body loses the ability to produce antibodies.
Research has shown that the virus attacks and destroys
CD4+T cells. Why does destruction of CD4+T cells lead
to a loss of antibody synthesis in HIV-infected patients?
a.
CD4+T cells are a required intermediate in a
series of cell-to-cell signaling events that must
be completed before B cells can mature.
b.
CD4+T cells have CD4 molecules covalently
bound to their cell surfaces and do not induce
apoptosis in other cells during an immune
