quation 2–11c,
is what we want; after setting
we solve 
for x, the final position of the car (when it stops):
The car traveled 7.0 m while the driver was reacting and another 16 m during
the braking period before coming to a stop, for a total distance traveled of
23 m. Figure 2–17 shows a graph of 
vs.
is constant from
until
and after 
it decreases linearly to zero.
NOTE From the equation above for x, we see that the stopping distance after
the driver hit the brakes  
increases with the square of the initial
speed, not just linearly with speed. If you are traveling twice as fast, it takes
four times the distance to stop.
