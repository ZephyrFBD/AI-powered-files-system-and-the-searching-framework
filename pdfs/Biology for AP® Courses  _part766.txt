 be stored in a sugar bowl by creating a
diagram similar to Figure 6.10.
3.
If table sugar is placed in a spoon held over a
high flame, the sugar is charred and becomes a
blackened mixture composed primarily of
carbon. Create a visual representation that
includes a chemical equation to explain the role
of the flame in this process.

In terms of your answers to questions 1-3,
predict if sugar cubes in a bowl placed in a dish
of water can be stored on a table, and justify
your prediction.

[Extension] The energy of activation of a
chemical reaction can be determined by
measurement of the effect of temperature on
reaction rate. The natural logarithm of the
reaction rate constant is a linear function of the
inverse of the temperature in Kelvin degrees.
The negative of the slope of that graph is the
energy of activation divided by the universal
ideal gas constant, R = 8.314 J/Kmol. Using the
following data (R. Wolfenden and Yang Yean,
