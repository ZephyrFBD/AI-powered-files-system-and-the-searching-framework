throw caution to the wind and eat 500 Calories of ice cream and cake. To compen-
sate, you want to do an equivalent amount of work climbing stairs or a mountain.
How much total height must you climb?
APPROACH The work W you need to do in climbing stairs equals the change in
gravitational potential energy:
where h is the vertical height
climbed. For this estimate, let us approximate your mass as  
SOLUTION 500 food Calories is 500 kcal, which in joules is
The work done to climb a vertical height h is
We solve for h:
This is a huge elevation change (over 11,000 ft).
NOTE The human body does not transform food energy with 100% efficiency—
it is more like 20% efficient. As we shall discuss in the next Chapter, some
energy is always “wasted,” so you would actually have to climb only about
which is more reasonable (about 2300 ft of elevation gain).
