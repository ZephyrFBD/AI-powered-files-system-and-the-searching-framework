Preparing for the AP Exam 
Students should demonstrate understanding 
of the relationship between organisms 
and their environment by constructing 
and analyzing food chains and food webs 
and analyzing trophic diagrams. On past 
exams, when students have been asked to 
construct a food web from a data table, they 
have struggled with inferring the correct 
relationships between the organisms and 
with translating how a relationship between 
two organisms resulted in their placement 
on the food web. Another common error is 
the incorrect placement of the arrows that 
indicate energy flow. Students should use 
their knowledge from Unit 3 to explain how 
energy and carbon are transferred through 
an ecosystem so that they can predict how 
changes in the environment can impact an 
ecosystem, both positively and negatively.
Throughout the course, students should 
practice providing support for their claims 
about biological system
