way that the nonpolar hydrocarbon portions are tucked within the molecule, away from 
the polar water molecules. Most of the more polar acidic and basic side chains, however, 
project into the solution, where they can interact with water molecules through ion–
dipole, dipole–dipole, or hydrogen-bonding interactions.
Some proteins are assemblies of more than one polypeptide chain. Each chain has 
its own tertiary structure, and two or more of these tertiary subunits may aggregate into 
a larger functional macromolecule. The way the tertiary subunits are arranged is called 
the quaternary structure of the protein (Figure 24.18). For example, hemoglobin, 
the oxygen-carrying protein of red blood cells, consists of four tertiary subunits. Each 
subunit contains a component called a heme with an iron atom that binds oxygen as 
depicted in Figure 23.15. The q
