ume ratio decreases. If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will
not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume.
4.3 Eukaryotic Cells
Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is
typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a membrane), and has other
membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid
bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleusâ€™s nucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are either found in
the cytoplasm or attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. They perform
protein synthesis. Mitochondria participate in cellular respiration; they are responsible for the majority of ATP produced in
the cell. Peroxisomes hydrolyze fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacu
