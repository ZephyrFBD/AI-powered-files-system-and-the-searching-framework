The sum of these equals
the total lung capacity. Gas movement into or out of the lungs is dependent on the pressure of the gas. Air is a mixture of
gases; therefore, the partial pressure of each gas can be calculated to determine how the gas will flow in the lung. The
difference between the partial pressure of the gas in the air drives oxygen into the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the
body.
30.3 Breathing
The structure of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing. Upon inspiration, the diaphragm
contracts and lowers. The intercostal muscles contract and expand the chest wall outward. The intrapleural pressure drops,
the lungs expand, and air is drawn into the airways. When exhaling, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm relax, returning
the intrapleural pressure back to the resting state. The lungs recoil and airways close. The air passively exits the lung.
There is high surface tension at the air-airway interface in the lung. Surfactant, a mixture of phospho
