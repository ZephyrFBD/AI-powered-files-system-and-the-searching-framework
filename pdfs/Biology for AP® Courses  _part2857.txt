he direction of the stimulus, possibly accelerating it. Few examples of positive
feedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting,
or coagulation. As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved.
The direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine
contractions during childbirth, as illustrated in Figure 24.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system,
stimulates the contraction of the uterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin
and causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.
