ns 16.38 and 16.39, the NH4
+ and NH3 species cancel and we 
are left with the autoionization of water:
 
       NH4
+1aq2 ∆ NH31aq2 + H+1aq2
NH31aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH4
+1aq2 + OH-1aq2
           H2O1l2 ∆ H+1aq2 + OH-1aq2
 
This concentration is high enough that we 
can assume that Equation 16.37 is the only 
source of OH-; that is, we can neglect any 
OH- produced by the autoionization of H2O. 
We now assume a value of x for the initial 
concentration of ClO- and solve the equilib-
rium problem in the usual way.
We now use the expression for the base- 
dissociation constant to solve for x:
We say that the solution is 0.31 M in NaClO even though some of the 
ClO- ions have reacted with water. Because the solution is 0.31 M 
in NaClO and the total volume of solution is 2.00 L, 0.62 mol of  
NaClO is the amount of the salt that was added to the water.
