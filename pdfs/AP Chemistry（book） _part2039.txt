lar molecules, especially 
those that can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, tend to be soluble in water. 
For example, acetone, a polar molecule with the structural formula shown below, mixes 
in all proportions with water. Acetone has a strongly polar C “O bond and pairs of 
nonbonding electrons on the O atom that can form hydrogen bonds with water.

Liquids that mix in all proportions, such as acetone and water, are miscible, 
whereas those that do not dissolve in one another are immiscible. Gasoline, which is 
a mixture of hydrocarbons, is immiscible with water. Hydrocarbons are nonpolar sub-
stances because of several factors: The C ¬C bonds are nonpolar, the C ¬H bonds are 
nearly nonpolar, and the molecules are symmetrical enough to cancel much of the weak 
C ¬H
