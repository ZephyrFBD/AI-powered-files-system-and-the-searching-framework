 called chiasmata (singular,
chiasma). Chiasmata are sites where genetic material is exchanged between nonsister homologous chromatids, a
process called crossing over.
2. At metaphase I (alignment), homologous pairs of chromosomes are spread across the metaphase plate.
Microtubules extending from one pole are attached to the kinetochore of one member of each homologous pair.
Microtubules from the other pole are connected to the second member of each homologous pair.
3. Anaphase I (separation) begins when homologues uncouple as they are pulled to opposite poles.
4. In telophase I (restoration), the chromosomes have reached their respective poles, and a nuclear membrane
develops around them. Note that each pole will form a new nucleus that will have half the number of chromosomes,
but each chromosome will contain two chromatids. Since daughter nuclei will have half the number of
chromosomes, cells that they eventually form will be haploid.
Beginning in telophase I, the cells of many spec
