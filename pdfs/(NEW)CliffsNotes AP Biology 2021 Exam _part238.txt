Multiple-Choice Questions
1. D. At metaphase, there are 46 chromosomes with 2 chromatids each for a total of 92 chromatids. Metaphase ends
and anaphase begins when the 2 chromatids of each chromosome separate. Once separated, these 92 chromatids
become 92 chromosomes because each chromatid is now considered a complete chromosome, since it consists of a
complete DNA molecule. (To count the number of chromosomes at any point during the cell cycle, count the
centromeres.) Thus, there are now 92 chromosomes destined for 2 daughter cells (46 chromosomes per cell). After
cytokinesis, each daughter cell contains 46 chromosomes each consisting of 1 chromatid.
2. B. During metaphase I, homologous chromosomes pair at the metaphase plate. One member of each pair migrates
to opposite poles during anaphase I. If the cell started with 46 chromosomes, 23 chromosomes move to each pole
during anaphase
