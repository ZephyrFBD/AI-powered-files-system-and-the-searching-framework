ger over the top
of the straw, capturing some air above the water but preventing any additional air
from getting in or out, and then you lift the straw from the water. You find that
the straw retains most of the water (Fig. 10–5a). Does the air in the space between
your finger and the top of the water have a pressure P that is greater than, equal
to, or less than, the atmospheric pressure 
outside the straw?
RESPONSE Consider the forces on the column of water (Fig.10–5b). Atmospheric
pressure outside the straw pushes upward on the water at the bottom of the straw,
gravity pulls the water downward, and the air pressure inside the top of the
straw pushes downward on the water. Since the water is in equilibrium, the
upward force due to atmospheric pressure 
must balance the two downward
forces. The only way this is possible is for the air pressure P inside the straw at the
top to be less than the atmosphere pressure outside the straw. (When you initially
remove the straw from the water gl
