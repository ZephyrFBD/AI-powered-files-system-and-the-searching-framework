incoming ball bounces backward with a speed of 
Calculate (a) the velocity of the target ball after the colli-
sion, and (b) the mass of the target ball.
32. (II) Determine the fraction of kinetic energy lost by 
a neutron 
when it collides head-on and
elastically with a target particle at rest which is (a)
(b) 
(heavy hydrogen,
);
(c) 
(d) 
(lead,
).

33. (I) In a ballistic pendulum experiment, projectile 1 results 
in a maximum height h of the pendulum equal to 2.6 cm.
A second projectile (of the same mass) causes the pendulum
to swing twice as high,
The second projectile
was how many times faster than the first?
34. (II) (a) Derive a formula for the fraction of kinetic energy
lost,
in terms of m and M for the ballistic pendu-
lum collision of Example 7â€“9. (b) Evaluate for
and
35. (II) A 28-g rifle bullet traveling 
embeds itself in a
3.1-kg pendulum hanging on a 2.8-m-long string, which
makes the pendulum swing upw
