a solution of pH 3 is 10 times more acidic than a
solution with a pH of 4. A solution with a pH of 6 is 1,000 times more
acidic than a solution with a pH of 9; see Figure 2.3.

IT’S TRICKY
As the H+ concentration increases, the pH decreases.
The pH of some common substances is as follows:
Stomach acid
2
Human blood
7.4
Acid rain
1.5–5.4
The internal pH of most living cells is close to 7. Even a slight change
can be harmful. Biological systems regulate their pH through the presence
of buffers, substances that resist changes in pH. A buffer works by either
absorbing excess hydrogen ions or donating hydrogen ions when there are
too few. The most important buffer in human blood is the bicarbonate
ion.
