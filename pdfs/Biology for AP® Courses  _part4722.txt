Genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their
cells, both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. This chemical diversity has potential benefit
for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health
and welfare.
Humans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi. This diversity is also suffering losses because of
migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in heavily populated regions such as China,
India, and Japan. The human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its decline is troubling
biologists and agricultural scientists.
It is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given
geographic area (Figure 38.2). Whole ecosystems can disap
