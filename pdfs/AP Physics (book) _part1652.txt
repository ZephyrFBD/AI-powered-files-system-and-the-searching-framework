y of the whole system was positive. This result, which we have
calculated for a specific case in Example 15â€“14, has been found to hold in all
other cases tested. That is, the total entropy of an isolated system is found to
increase in all natural processes. The second law of thermodynamics can be stated
in terms of entropy as follows: The entropy of an isolated system never decreases.
It can only stay the same or increase. Entropy can remain the same only for an
idealized (reversible) process. For any real process, the change in entropy 
is
greater than zero:
(15;9)
If the system is not isolated, then the change in entropy of the system,
plus
the change in entropy of the environment,
must be greater than or equal
to zero:
(15;10)
Only idealized processes can have 
Real processes always have 
This, then, is the general statement of the second law of thermodynamics:
the total entropy of any system plus that of its environment increases as a
result of any natural process.
Although the ent
