iological macromolecule in which the ratio of carbon to hydrogen and to oxygen is 1:2:1; carbohydrates
serve as energy sources and structural support in cells and form the a cellular exoskeleton of arthropods
polysaccharide that makes up the cell wall of plants; provides structural support to the cell
(also, chaperonin) protein that helps nascent protein in the folding process
type of carbohydrate that forms the outer skeleton of all arthropods that include crustaceans and insects; it also forms
the cell walls of fungi
(also, condensation) reaction that links monomer molecules together, releasing a molecule of
water for each bond formed
loss of shape in a protein as a result of changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals
double-helical molecule that carries the hereditary information of the cell
two sugar monomers that are linked together by a glycosidic bond
catalyst in a biochemical reaction that is usually a complex or conjugated protein
