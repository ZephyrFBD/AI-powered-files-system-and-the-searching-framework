micals in the oil or soap absorb various colors.
(c) Dispersion due to differences in index of refraction in the oil or soap.
(d) The interactions of the light with a thin boundary layer where the oil (or
soap) and the water have mixed irregularly.
(e) Light waves reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the thin oil or
soap film can add up constructively for particular wavelengths.

ight carries energy. Evidence for this can come from focusing the Sunâ€™s rays
with a magnifying glass on a piece of paper and burning a hole in it. But
how does light travel, and in what form is this energy carried? In our dis-
cussion of waves in Chapter 11, we noted that energy can be carried from place
to place in basically two ways: by particles or by waves. In the first case, material
objects or particles can carry energy, such as an avalanche of rocks or rushing
water. In the second case, water waves and sound waves, for example, can carry
energy over long distances even though the oscillating p
