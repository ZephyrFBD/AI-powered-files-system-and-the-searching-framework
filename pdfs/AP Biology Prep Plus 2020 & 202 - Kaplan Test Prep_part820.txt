ecies can thrive or
dominate in an ecosystem. This change in the species makeup of
an ecosystem is called ecological succession.
Environmental Dynamics
Environmental dynamics deals with the flow of energy and other
nutrients through the environment. Energy flow is traditionally shown in
the form of a food web. Arrows are drawn between diﬀerent species of
organisms, with the direction of the arrow indicating the direction of
energy flow.

19.4 Contrast how matter is recycled and energy flows
In the illustration of a terrestrial food web, the arrows indicate the
direction of energy flow between the organisms. The fruits, seeds, and
acorns only have arrows pointing away from them, so they are primary
producers. The lynx is the top predator (tertiary consumer) and only has
arrows pointing toward it. There are no decomposers shown in this food
web.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Energy is lost as it moves through the various food webs. Only
