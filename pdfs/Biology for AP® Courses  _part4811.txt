al. In the United States, since the mid-1980s, many
aging dams are being considered for removal rather than replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value
of free-flowing rivers and because many dams no longer provide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first
built. The measured benefits of dam removal include restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams
is frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which leads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality. In the
Pacific Northwest, dam removal projects are expected to increase populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone
species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems during its annual spawning migrations. In other regions
such as the Atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of spawning anadromous fish species (species that are born
in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh water to spawn
