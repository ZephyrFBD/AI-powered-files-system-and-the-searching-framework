 able to construct explanations of the 
mechanisms and structural features of cells that allow 
organisms to capture, store, or use free energy.
(A)
This option is correct. Mice are endotherms and at cold temperatures will 
increase their rate of ATP production in order to shiver. This increase in 
metabolism will produce heat according to the second law of thermodynamics. 
This heat production will help the mouse maintain a constant internal 
environment. 
(B)
This option is incorrect because a lower metabolic rate would mean a lower 
consumption of oxygen. The data do not support this claim. The mouse consumed 
more oxygen at 10oC than at 25oC.
(C)
This option is incorrect because the data for oxygen consumption were controlled 
for by mass / weight. All numbers are mL/g.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the data do not support this claim. If the mice 
were more active at the higher temperature, then they would have consumed 
more oxygen. More activity would require more ATP, whi
