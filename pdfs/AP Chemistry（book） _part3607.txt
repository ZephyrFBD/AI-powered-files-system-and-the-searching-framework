ydrogen 
called boron hydrides, or boranes. Diborane 1B2H62 has an unusual 
structure with two hydrogen atoms that bridge between the two 
boron atoms. Boranes react with oxygen to form boric oxide 1B2O32, 
in which boron is in the +3 oxidation state. Boric oxide is the anhy-
dride of boric acid 1H3BO32. Boric acid readily undergoes condensa-
tion reactions.
