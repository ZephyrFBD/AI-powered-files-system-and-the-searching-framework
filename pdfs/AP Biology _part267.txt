terized by blending. Here are two
examples. A long watermelon (LL) crossed with a round watermelon (RR)
produces all oval watermelons (RL). A black animal (BB) crossed with a
white animal (WW) produces all gray animals (BW). Since neither trait is
dominant, the convention for writing the genes is all capital letters.
A red Japanese four o’clock flower (RR) crossed with a white Japanese
four o’clock flower (WW) produces all pink offspring (RW):
If two pink four o’clocks are crossed, there is a 25 percent chance that the
offspring will be red, a 25 percent chance the offspring will be white, and a
50 percent chance the offspring will be pink.

REMEMBER
Incomplete dominance is a blending. In codominance, both traits show.
Codominance
In codominance, both traits show. A good example is the MN blood
groups in humans. (These are not related to ABO blood groups.) There are
three different blood groups: M, N, and MN. These groups are based on
two dis
