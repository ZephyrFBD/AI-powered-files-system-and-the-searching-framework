de environment, then
some mechanism must provide gas exchange to internal cells, delivering O2and removing waste CO2. The
movement of gases into and out of the entire organism is called respiration. (This term, respiration, is also used to
describe cellular respiration, the process of producing ATP within the mitochondria of cells.) The following gas
exchange mechanisms are found in animals:
1. Direct with environment. Some animals are small enough to allow gas exchange directly with the outside
environment. Many of these animals, such as the Platyhelminthes (flatworms), typically have large surface areas,
and every cell either is exposed to the outside environment or is close enough that gases are available by diffusion
through adjacent cells. In larger animals, such as the Annelida (segmented worms), gas exchange through the skin is
augmented by a distribution system (a circulatory system) just inside the skin.
2. Gills. Gills are evaginated structures, or outgrowths from the body, t
