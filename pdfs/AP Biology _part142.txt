se, chromosomes do not
replicate between meiosis I and II because chromosomes already exist as
double or replicated chromosomes.

Meiosis II
Meiosis II is functionally the same as mitosis and consists of the same
phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. The
chromosome number remains haploid.
Figure 4.6 is a sketch comparing meiosis and mitosis. Each parent cell
contains four chromosomes. The cell undergoing meiosis experiences one
crossover.
LOOK CLOSELY
Pay attention to how metaphase differs during mitosis and meiosis I.

MEIOSIS AND GENETIC VARIATION
Three types of genetic variation result from the processes of meiosis and
fertilization. They are independent assortment of chromosomes,
crossing-over, and random fertilization of an ovum by a sperm.
