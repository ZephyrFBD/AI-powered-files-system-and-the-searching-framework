 23.20  The most important oxides of iron are magnetite, Fe3O4, 
and hematite, Fe2O3. (a) What are the oxidation states 
of iron in these compounds? (b) One of these iron 
oxides is ferrimagnetic, and the other is antiferromag-
netic. Which iron oxide is more likely to be ferrimag-
netic? Explain.

 23.21  (a) Using Wernerâ€™s definition of valence, which property is 
the same as oxidation number, primary valence or secondary 
valence? (b) What term do we normally use for the other 
type of valence? (c) Why can NH3 serve as a ligand but BH3 
cannot?
