d to 
spend time learning how to collect data using the equipment. 
■ General Procedure 
1. Use a gas pressure sensor to measure the rate of cellular respiration in germinating 
seeds at 20°C over a 25-minute time interval or as per instructed by your teacher. 
2. What additional questions can you explore about cellular respiration from this 
experiment? 
3. In the next part of this investigation, you will design and conduct your own 
experiments to answer questions that you raised in the first part of the investigation. 
Do you have any suggestions for improving the procedure provided for measuring 
oxygen consumption/cellular respiration using a gas pressure sensor with computer 
interface?

■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Now that you have learned how to measure the rate of cellular respiration in 
germinating seeds, you have a tool for exploring questions on your own. Think about 
the process of cellular r
