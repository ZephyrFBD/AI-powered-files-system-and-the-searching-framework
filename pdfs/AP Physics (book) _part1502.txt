y. What other assumptions did you make?
6. (a) The second postulate of kinetic theory is that the molecules
are, on average, far apart from one another. That is, their
average separation is much greater than the diameter of
each molecule. Is this assumption reasonable? To check,
calculate the average distance between molecules of a gas 
at STP
, and compare it to the diameter of a typical gas mole-
cule, about 0.3 nm. (b) If the molecules were the diameter of
ping-pong balls, say 4 cm, how far away would the next
ping-pong ball be on average? (c) Repeat part a, but now
assume the gas has been compressed so that the pressure is
now 3 atm but still at 273 K. (d) Estimate what 
of the
total volume of gas is taken up by molecules themselves in
parts a and c. [Note that the volume of the molecules them-
selves can become a significant part of the total volume at
lower temperatures and higher pressures. Hence the actual
volume the molecules have to bounce around in is less than
the total vol
