abolic efficiency. 
(D) Compartmentalization leads to a higher 
mutation rate in DNA, which leads to more 
new species. 
 
 2. By discharging electric sparks into a laboratory 
chamber atmosphere that consisted of water 
vapor, hydrogen gas, methane, and ammonia, 
Stanley Miller obtained data that showed that a 
number of organic molecules, including many 
amino acids, could be synthesized. Miller was 
attempting to model early Earth conditions as 
understood in the 1950s. The results of Millerâ€™s 
experiments best support which of the following 
hypotheses? 
(A) The molecules essential to life today did not 
exist at the time Earth was first formed. 
(B) The molecules essential to life today could 
not have been carried to the primordial 
Earth by a comet or meteorite. 
(C) The molecules essential to life today could 
have formed under early Earth conditions. 
(D) The molecules essential to life today were 
initially self-replicating proteins that were 
synthesized approximately four b
