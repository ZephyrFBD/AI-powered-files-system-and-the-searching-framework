 than that in octa-
hedral ones, assign a color to each complex.
 23.83  Oxyhemoglobin, with an O2 bound to iron, is a low-spin 
Fe(II) complex; deoxyhemoglobin, without the O2 mole-
cule, is a high-spin complex. (a) Assuming that the coor-
dination environment about the metal is octahedral, how 
many unpaired electrons are centered on the metal ion 
in each case? (b) What ligand is coordinated to the iron 
in place of O2 in deoxyhemoglobin? (c) Explain in a gen-
eral way why the two forms of hemoglobin have different 
colors (hemoglobin is red, whereas deoxyhemoglobin has 
a bluish cast). (d) A 15-minute exposure to air containing 
400 ppm of CO causes about 10% of the hemoglobin in the

blood to be converted into the carbon monoxide complex, 
called carboxyhemoglobin. What does this suggest about 
the relative equilibrium constants for binding of carbon 
monoxide and O2 to hemoglobin? (e) CO is
