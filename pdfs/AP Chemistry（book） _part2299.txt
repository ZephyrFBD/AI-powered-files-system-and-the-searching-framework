order for a collision to be 
effective.
Because the kinetic energy of molecules depends on tem-
perature, the rate constant of a reaction is very dependent on 
temperature. The relationship between k and temperature is given 
by the Arrhenius equation: k = Ae-Ea>RT. The term A is called the fre-
quency factor; it relates to the number of collisions that are favorably 
oriented for reaction. The Arrhenius equation is often used in loga-
rithmic form: ln k = ln A - Ea>RT. Thus, a graph of ln k versus 1>T 
yields a straight line with slope -Ea>R.
REACTION MECHANISMS (SECTION 14.6) A reaction mechanism 
details the individual steps that occur in the course of a reaction. 
Each of these steps, called elementary reactions, has a well-defined 
rate law that depends on the number of molecules (the molecularity) 
of the step. Elementary reactions are defined as either unimolecular, 
bimolecular, or termolecular, depending on whether one, two, or three 
reactant molecules are involved, respectiv
