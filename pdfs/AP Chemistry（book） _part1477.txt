the molecule.
(c) The bond order of O2
+ is between that for O2 (bond order 2) 
and N2 (bond order 3). Thus, the bond enthalpy and bond 
length should be about midway between those for O2 and N2, 
approximately 700 kJ>mol and 1.15 Å. (The experimentally 
measured values are 625 kJ>mol and 1.123 Å.)
