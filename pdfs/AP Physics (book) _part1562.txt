ESTIMATE
An interesting application of thermal radiation to diagnostic medicine is
thermography. A special instrument, the thermograph, scans the body, measuring
the intensity of infrared† radiation from many points and forming a picture that
resembles an X-ray (Fig. 14–13). Areas where metabolic activity is high, such as
in tumors, can often be detected on a thermogram as a result of their higher tem-
perature and consequent increased radiation.
