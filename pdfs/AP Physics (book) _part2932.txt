he result can be stated most
simply in words as:
the length of an object moving relative to an observer is measured to be
shorter along its direction of motion than when it is at rest.
This is called length contraction. The length 
in Eqs. 26–3 is called the 
proper length. It is the length of the object (or distance between two points whose
positions are measured at the same time) as determined by observers at rest with
respect to the object. Equations 26–3 give the length that will be measured by
observers when the object travels past them at speed v.

It is important to note that length contraction occurs only along the direction
of motion. For example, the moving spaceship in Fig. 26–8a is shortened in
length, but its height is the same as when it is a
