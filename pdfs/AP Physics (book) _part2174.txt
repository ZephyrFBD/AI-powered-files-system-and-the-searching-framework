Magnets produce magnetic fields,
but so do electric currents. Compass
needles are magnets, and they align
along the direction of any magnetic
field present. Here, the compasses
show the presence (and direction) 
of a magnetic field near a current-
carrying wire. We shall see in this
Chapter how magnetic field is
