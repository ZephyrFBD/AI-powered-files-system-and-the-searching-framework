 charges of 2+ and 2-, melts at 2852 °C. The interactions between cations 
and anions also increase as the ions get smaller, as we see from the melting points of the 
alkali metal halides in Table 12.3. These trends mirror the trends in lattice enthalpy dis-
cussed in Section 8.2.

CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
Although ionic and metallic solids both have high melting and boiling points, 
the differences between ionic and metallic bonding are responsible for important 
differences in their properties. Because the valence electrons in ionic compounds are 
confined to the anions, rather than being delocalized, ionic compounds are typically 
electrical insulators. They tend to be brittle, a property explained by repulsive inter-
actions between ions of like charge. When stress is applied to an ionic solid, as in 
Figure 12.24, the planes of atoms, which before the stress were arranged with cations 
next to anions, shift so that the alignment
