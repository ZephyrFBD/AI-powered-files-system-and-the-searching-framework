(A) the homologous chromosomes are lined up in the middle
(B) the sister chromatids are lined up in the middle

28. Suppose scientists discovered in the fossil record or molecular biology that tiger-like ancestors lived for
millions of years before a mutation occurred. This mutation caused a striped phe
