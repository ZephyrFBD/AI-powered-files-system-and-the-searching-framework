c periods. It may
have been caused by an asteroid impact or a volcanic eruption. About 50% of all species became extinct. The
extinction opened up ecological niches that were filled by dinosaurs as they became the dominant terrestrial fauna.
3. Plate tectonics (continental drift) describes the movement of land masses, called plates, over the surface of the
earth. Fault lines are plate boundaries. When plates collide, they generate earthquakes, create volcanos, and form
mountains. Plates that are moving apart form ocean basins between them. The formation of continents arising from
the separation of larger plates is a long-term isolating mechanism for speciation. As mountains and volcanos form
and as plates move to new latitudes, environmental conditions change, creating new niches for speciation.
Australia, Antarctica, South America, Africa, Madagascar, and India were once joined as parts of a supercontinent
called Gondwana (also called Gondwanaland). During their early evolution, mamma
