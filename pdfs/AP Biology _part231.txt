Chlorophyll a is the pigment that participates directly in the light
reactions of photosynthesis. It is a large molecule with a single magnesium
atom in the head surrounded by alternating double and single bonds. The
head, called the porphyrin ring, is attached to a long hydrocarbon tail. The
double bonds within the head of a molecule play a critical role in the light
reactions. They are the source of the electrons that flow through the
electron transport chains during photosynthesis. Figure 7.3 is a drawing of
chlorophyll a.

THE CHLOROPLAST
The chloroplast contains photosynthetic pigments that, along with
enzymes, carry out photosynthesis. It contains grana, where the li
