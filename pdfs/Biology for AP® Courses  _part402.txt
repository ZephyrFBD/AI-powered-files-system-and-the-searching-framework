ual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special
stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.
Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two
parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification is the process of
enlarging an object in appearance. Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as
separate: the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image. When oil immersion lenses are used for the
study of small objects, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times. In order to gain a better understanding of cellular
structure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes.
