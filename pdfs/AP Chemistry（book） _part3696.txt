e see that the oxidation 
number of Cr is +3:
+3 + 4(0) + 2(−1) + (−1) = 0
[Cr(H2O)4Cl2]Cl
 
Thus, we have chromium(III). Finally, the an-
ion is chloride. The name of the compound is 
tetraaquadichlorochromium(III) chloride.
(b) The complex has four cyanide ion ligands, CN-, which means 
tetracyano, and the oxidation state of the nickel is zero:
4(+1) + 0 + 4(−1) = 0
K4[Ni(CN)4]
Because the complex is an anion, the metal is indicated as 
nickelate(0). Putting these parts together and naming the 
cation ﬁrst, we have potassium tetracyanonickelate(0).
