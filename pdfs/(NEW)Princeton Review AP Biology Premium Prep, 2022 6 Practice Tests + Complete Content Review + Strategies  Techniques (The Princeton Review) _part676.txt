n myosin stretches into a high-energy conformation and binds to the filamentous protein actin.
When the myosin returns to its low-energy, relaxed conformation, actin is pulled, and the sarcomere contracts. The
following steps relate ATP to each step of this process.
1—Myosin binds to actin (ADP is attached).
2—Myosin returns to low-energy conformation (ADP is released).
3—Myosin releases actin (ATP binds).
4—Myosin stretches to high-energy conformation (ATP is hydrolyzed).
26. What is bound to myosin when it is in its high-energy conformation?
I. Actin
II. ATP
III. ADP
(A) II only
(B) III only
(C) I and II
(D) I and III
27. If the cell runs out of ATP, what would be the state of the sarcomere?
(A) Myosin is bound to actin in the high-energy conformation.
(B) Myosin is alone in the high-energy conformation.
(C) Myosin is bound to actin in the low-energy conformation.
(D) Myosin is alone in the low-energy conformation.
28. A calcium ion is required for the binding of myosin to actin. If
