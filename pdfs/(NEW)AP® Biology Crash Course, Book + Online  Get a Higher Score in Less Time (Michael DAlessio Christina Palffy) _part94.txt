DNA Replication
A. During replication, each strand of a DNA molecule acts as a template for the synthesis of the other strand,
and when errors do occur, proofreading and repair mechanisms keep mutation rates low.
B. All of the chromosomes of an organism’s genome (all of an organism’s DNA) are copied prior to each
cell division.
1. Each strand acts as a template for the synthesis of its complementary strand through the addition of
nucleotides to the growing end of the complement.
2. DNA replication begins at origins of replication distributed at many sites along the length of each
eukaryotic chromosome and usually at a single site on the chromosome of prokaryotes.
3. DNA polymerase is the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to the ends of a growing
strand of DNA through a process called elongation.
C. The process of DNA replication occ
