to ions. Substances with polar covalent bonds
are similarly soluble because of the interaction of their poles with those of water. Substances that dissolve in water
are called hydrophilic (“water loving”). Because they lack charged poles, nonpolar covalent substances do not
dissolve in water and are called hydrophobic (“water fearing”). Because so many kinds of molecules are soluble in
water, it is often referred to as a universal solvent. In general, a solute is a substance that dissolves in a solvent.
When that solvent is water, the solution is called an aqueous solution.
2. Water has a high specific heat capacity. Specific heat is the degree to which a substance changes temperature in
response to a gain or loss of heat. Water has a high specific heat, changing temperature very slowly with changes in
its heat content. You must add a relatively large amount of energy to warm (and boil) water or remove a relatively
large amount of energy to cool (and freeze) water. When sweat evaporate
