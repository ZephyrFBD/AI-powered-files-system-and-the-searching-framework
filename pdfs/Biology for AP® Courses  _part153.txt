of electrons in the outermost shells. These energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol “n.” For
example, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus.

Figure 2.6 The Bohr model was developed by Niels Bohr in 1913. In this model, electrons exist within principal shells.
An electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from
a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays
back to the ground state. In the process, a photon of light is released.
Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals
of increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled w
