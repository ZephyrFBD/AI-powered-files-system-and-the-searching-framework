does not allow for 
expression of the colored pigments. Individuals 
without a T allele have white eyes regardless of 
the alleles of other eye-color genes.  
  Which of the following represents a cross between 
a white-eyed female and a red-eyed male? 
(A) Tt XRXR × tt XrY 
(B) Tt XrXr × tt XRY

12. Some strains of the bacterium Streptococcus 
pyogenes secrete poisonous substances called 
exotoxins. The genes encoding the exotoxins are 
thought to have originated in bacteriophages, 
which are viruses that infect bacteria. 
  Which of the following is the most likely 
mechanism by which the S. pyogenes acquired the 
ability to produce the exotoxins? 
(A) Bacteriophages engulfed cellular debris from 
dead bacteria. 
(B) Bacteriophages in the environment activated 
bacterial cell division. 
(C) Bacteriophage DNA became integrated in the 
bacterial chromosome. 
(D) Bacteriophage proteins were absorbed into 
bacteria cells by endocytosis.
