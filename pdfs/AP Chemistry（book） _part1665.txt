 10.49 Which of the following statements best explains why a closed 
balloon filled with helium gas rises in air?
(a) Helium is a monatomic gas, whereas nearly all the mole-
cules that make up air, such as nitrogen and oxygen, are 
diatomic.
(b) The average speed of helium atoms is greater than the 
average speed of air molecules, and the greater speed 
of collisions with the balloon walls propels the balloon 
upward.
(c) Because the helium atoms are of lower mass than the av-
erage air molecule, the helium gas is less dense than air. 
The mass of the balloon is thus less than the mass of the 
air displaced by its volume.
(d) Because helium has a lower molar mass than the average 
air molecule, the helium atoms are in faster motion. This 
means that the temperature of the helium is greater than 
the air temperature. Hot gases tend to rise.
