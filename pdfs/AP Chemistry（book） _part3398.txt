the images shown in Figure 21.11 reveal that levels of activity in brains 
of patients with Alzheimer’s disease are different from the levels in 
those without the disease.

reactants. The mass change for the decay of 1 mol of uranium-238 can then be expressed 
in grams:
 
233.9942 g + 4.0015 g - 238.0003 g = -0.0046 g 
The fact that the system has lost mass indicates that the process is exothermic. All spon-
taneous nuclear reactions are exothermic.
The energy change per mole associated with this reaction is
 
∆E = ∆1mc22 = c2∆m
 = 12.9979 * 108 m/s221-0.0046 g2a
1 kg
1000 gb
 = -4.1 * 1011kg@m2
s2
= -4.1 * 1011 J
Notice that ∆m must be converted to kilograms, the SI unit of mass, to obtain ∆E in 
joules, the SI unit of energy. The negative sign for the energy change indicates that 
energy is released in the reaction—in this case, over
