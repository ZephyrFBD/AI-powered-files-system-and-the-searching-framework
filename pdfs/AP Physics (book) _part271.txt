ainly you must avoid just
plugging numbers into equations that seem to “work.”
1. As always, read carefully; choose the object (or
objects) you are going to analyze.
2. Draw a careful diagram showing what is happening
to the object.
3. Choose an origin and an xy coordinate system.
4. Decide on the time interval, which for projectile
motion can only include motion under the effect of
gravity alone, not throwing or landing. The time inter-
val must be the same for the x and y analyses. The x
and y motions are connected by the common time, .
