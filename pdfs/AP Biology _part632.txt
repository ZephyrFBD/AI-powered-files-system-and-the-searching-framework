the suppression of growth in a plant, as well as the promotion of
seed dormancy. Choice C is incorrect because the evaporation of
water from leaves (transpiration) powers the movement of water and
nutrients up a plant in xylem vessels. Choice D is incorrect because
sugars are transported in phloem, not xylem. Also, xylem flow does
not require the expenditure of energy, whereas phloem transport
does.
(B) Notice that the plants grown without Curvularia did not grow at
all at 45 degrees. Clearly, Curvularia helps the plants grow and is
not a parasite.
(C) Water flows from high water potential to low water potential. ψ =
–0.8 MPa is a higher value than ψ = –1.1 MPa, so water flows from
A to B. ψ = –0.4 MPa is a higher value than ψ = –0.6 MPa, so water
flows from D to C. Notice the circle of flow from A to B and then
from D to C.
(D) Aquaporins are channels that can rapidly open and close to allow
large amounts of water across a plant membrane. The water flows
down the gradient and requires
