se (essay) questions 
based on the concepts studied in this investigation. One good example is the free-
response question about Bursatella leachii (sea slug) from the 1997 AP Biology 
Exam.These questions could be used to assess students’ understanding.
The Summative Assessment section 
(Teacher Manual) offers suggestions 
for evaluating students’ understanding 
of the concepts, development of 
science practices, and gain in thinking 
skills after students conduct their lab 
investigations and analyze their results.

■Where Can Students Go from Here?
One possible extension for this investigation is to ask students to identify another 
organism that behaves similarly to the fruit fly and one that they expect would behave 
differently. For example, students could substitute ladybugs, houseflies, or mealworms 
for fruit flies and construct choice chambers using other substances that they think 
might be attractive to these organisms.
