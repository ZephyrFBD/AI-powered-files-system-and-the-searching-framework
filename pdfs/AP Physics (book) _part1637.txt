o is unattainable. This result is known as the third law of thermodynamics.
Because no engine can be 100% efficient, it can be stated that
no device is possible whose sole effect is to transform a given amount of heat
completely into work.
This is known as the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics.
Figure 15–15 diagrams the ideal perfect heat engine, which can not exist.

15–6 Refrigerators, Air Conditioners,
and Heat Pumps
The operating principle of refrigerators, air conditioners, and heat pumps is just
the reverse of a heat engine. Each operates to transfer heat out of a cool environ-
ment into a warm environment. As diagrammed in Fig. 15–16, by doing work W,
heat is taken from a low-temperature region,
(such as inside a refrigerator),
and a greater amount of heat is exhausted at a high temperature,
(the room).
Heat 
is removed from cooling coils inside the refrigerator and heat 
is given
off by coils outside the rear of the refrigerator, Fig. 15–17. You
