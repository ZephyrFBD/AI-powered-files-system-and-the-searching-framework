of waste from human
activities can be expected to change in the next 50 years
and why. Explain how that change could impact a specific
ecosystem.
a.
The amount of waste generated by human
activities will increase exponentially as the
human population continues to increase
exponentially. Removal of waste would require a
decrease in habitats, which will lead to decrease
in populations of species dependent on those
habitats.
