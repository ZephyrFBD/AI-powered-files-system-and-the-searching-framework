 fluids from temperature changes.
Third, the high heat of vaporization of water
allows animals to cool themselves by sweating.
b.
First, the higher density of water as a solid
versus a liquid allows ice to float, forming an
insulating surface layer for aquatic life. Second,
the high specific heat capacity of water insulates
aquatic life or bodily fluids from temperature
changes. Third, the low heat of vaporization of
water allows animals to cool themselves by
sweating.
