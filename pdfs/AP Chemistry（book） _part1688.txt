[10.111] A glass vessel fitted with a stopcock valve has a mass of 
337.428 g when evacuated. When filled with Ar, it has a 
mass of 339.854 g. When evacuated and refilled with a 
mixture of Ne and Ar, under the same conditions of tem-
perature and pressure, it has a mass of 339.076 g. What is 
the mole percent of Ne in the gas mixture?

Consider the following gases, all at STP: Ne, SF6, N2, CH4. 
(a) Which gas is most likely to depart from the assump-
tion of the kinetic-molecular theory that says there are 
no attractive or repulsive forces between molecules? 
 
(b) Which one is closest to an ideal gas in its behavior? 
(c) Which one has t
