ties. Residues can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or
hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of amino acid residues, their positions,
sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. This specific
environment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates). Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like
match between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition state and the active
site), enzymes are known for their specificity. The “best fit” results from the shape and the amino acid functional group’s
attraction to the substrate. There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction;
however, there is flexibility as well.
The fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject
to influen
