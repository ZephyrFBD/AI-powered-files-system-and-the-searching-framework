1.C
Explain biological concepts, 
processes, and/or models 
in applied contexts.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.K
Describe the structures 
involved in passing hereditary 
information from one 
generation to the next.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.K.1
DNA, and in some cases RNA, is the primary 
source of heritable information.
IST-1.K.2
Genetic information is transmitted from one 
generation to the next through DNA or RNA—
a.	Genetic information is stored in and 
passed to subsequent generations through 
DNA molecules and, in some cases, 
RNA molecules.
b.	Prokaryotic organisms typically have circular 
chromosomes, while eukaryotic organisms 
typically have multiple linear chromosomes.
IST-1.K.3
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can contain 
plasmids, which are small extra-chromosomal, 
double-stranded, circular DNA molecules.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-1
Heritable information provides for continuity of life.
