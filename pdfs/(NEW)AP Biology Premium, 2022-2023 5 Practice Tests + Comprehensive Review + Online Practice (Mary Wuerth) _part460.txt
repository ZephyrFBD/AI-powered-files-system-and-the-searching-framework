e
number of teeth in species C is closest to the number of teeth in C. porosus, and the DNA sequence of
species C has the highest percentage of homology with C. porosus.
(b) Species A and species B would be less efficient predators than C. porosus because they both have fewer
teeth than C. porosus.
(c) The data do not support the claim that species B shares a more recent common ancestor with C. porosus
than do species A or species C. In fact, species C has the most in common with C. porosus.
(d) The DNA from species B only has 90% homology with the DNA from C. porosus, while species Câ€™s DNA
has 98% homology with the DNA from C. porosus. Thus, species C likely has a more recent common
ancestor with C. porosus than species B does.
12. (a) It is likely that the E. coli on the starter plate (plate 1) contain mostly bacteria that are susceptible to
ampicillin and some bacteria that are resistant to ampicillin. Natural selection acts upon variations in
populations, and it is likely that ther
