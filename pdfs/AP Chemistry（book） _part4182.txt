 3 half-lives, the concentra-
tion will be 1>8 of its original value, so 1.25 g of the substance 
remains. page 587 Yes, using t = t1/2 and [A]t = [A]0/2 the half life 
of a zero-order reaction is t1/2 = [A]0/2k. page 589 According to 
the figure, the energy barrier is lower in the forward direction than 
in the reverse. Thus, more molecules will have energy sufficient to 
cross the barrier in the forward direction. The forward rate will be 
greater page 590 No. If B can be isolated, it canâ€™t correspond to  
the top of the energy barrier. There would be transition states 
for each of the individual reactions above page 593 Bimolecu-
lar. page 598 The likelihood of three molecules colliding at exactly 
the same time is vanishingly small. page 603 A heterogeneous cat-
alyst is in a different phase than the reactants and is therefore fairly 
easy to remove from the mixture. The removal of a homogeneous 
catalyst can be much more difficult as it exists in the same phase as 
the reactants.
