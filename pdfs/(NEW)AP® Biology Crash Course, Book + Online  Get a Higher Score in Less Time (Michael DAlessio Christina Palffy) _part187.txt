. In aerobic respiration, this NADH gets
oxidized during the electron transport chain. NAD+ is therefore formed again and can be reused in
glycolysis. Since in fermentation, there is no electron transport chain, the NADH needs an alternative
pathway to be replenished. As shown in the diagram, NAD+ is formed during the conversion of
pyruvate to lactic acid, and that NAD+ enters glycolysis again. (B) is incorrect since there is no
electron transport chain in anaerobic respiration. (C) and (D) are both incorrect, as no formation of
ATP is shown in the diagram.
8. The correct answer is (B). (A) is incorrect, as the organisms are submerged in water; thus, no water
will evaporate from them. (B) is correct, because at all times, organisms must be catabolizing glucose
or other organic molecules in order to transfer energy to ATP. That process produces carbon dioxide,
which leaves the organism as a gas, thus decreasing the organismâ€™s mass. (C) is incorrect.
Photosynthesis adds to the mass of or
