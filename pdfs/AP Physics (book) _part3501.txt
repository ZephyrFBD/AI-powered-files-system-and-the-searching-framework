tment is to insert a tiny radioactive source directly
inside a tumor, which will eventually kill the majority of the cells. A similar
technique is used to treat cancer of the thyroid with the radioactive isotope 
The thyroid gland concentrates iodine present in the bloodstream, particularly in
any area where abnormal growth is taking place. Its intense radioactivity can
destroy the defective cells.
Another application of radiation is for sterilizing bandages, surgical equipment,
and even packaged foods such as ground beef, chicken, and produce, because
bacteria and viruses can be killed or deactivated by large doses of radiation.

1–7 Tracers in Research and
Medicine
Radioactive isotopes are used in biological and medical research as tracers.
A given compound is artificially synthesized incorporating a radioactive isotope
such as 
or 
Such “tagged” molecules can then be traced as they move
through an organism or as they undergo chemical reactions. The presence of
these tagged molecule
