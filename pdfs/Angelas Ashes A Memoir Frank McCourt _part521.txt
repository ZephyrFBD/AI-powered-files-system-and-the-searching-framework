oaf because we’re 
 
 too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning’s leaves.When 
 
 236 
 
 my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she 
 
 gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I’ll have to find more 
 
 lemonade. 
 
 We put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories 
 
 which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures 
 
  
  
 with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I 
 
 was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. 
 
 Joseph’s Church where no one can follow you if you’re a criminal, not 
 
 even if you killed your own mother.Malachy and Michael look shocked 
 
 over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was 
 
 only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the 
 
 poor. Michael says I’m an outlaw and if they catch me they’ll hang me 
 
 from the highest tree in the People’s Park the way outlaws are hange
