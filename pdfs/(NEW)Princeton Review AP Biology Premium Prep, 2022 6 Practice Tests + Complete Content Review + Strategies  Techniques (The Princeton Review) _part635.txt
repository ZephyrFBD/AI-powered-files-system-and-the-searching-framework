The resting potential depends on active transport (the Na+K+-ATPase pump) and the selective
permeability of the axon membrane to K+ than to Na+, which leads to a differential distribution of ions
across the axonal membrane.

A
The Krebs cycle releases carbon dioxide as the carbon molecules are broken down and electron carriers
are generated. Glucose is at the start of glycolysis and pyruvate is at the end of glycolysis. Lactic acid is
generated through fermentation.

B
A heterotroph obtains its energy from organic molecules. An autotroph obtains energy from sunlight
utilizing pigments such as chlorophyll and uses CO2 and water to make organic molecules. Therefore, (A)
and (C) can be eliminated. Heterotrophs can obtain their energy from ingesting autotrophs, but they can
also consume other heterotrophs. So you can eliminate (D), leaving (B) as your answer.

In meiosis, the sister chromatids separate during the second metaphase of meiosis (Meiosis II), whereas
the sist
