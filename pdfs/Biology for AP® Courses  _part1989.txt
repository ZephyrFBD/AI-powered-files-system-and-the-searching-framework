eae in Australia, southern Africa, and South America, for example, is best explained by
their presence prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up.
The great diversification of marsupials in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia’s long isolation.
Australia has an abundance of endemic species—species found nowhere else—which is typical of islands whose isolation
by expanses of water prevents species from migrating. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that
look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. The marsupials of Australia, the finches on the
Galápagos, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant
relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.
Molecular Biology
Like anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification. Evidence of a common
ancestor for all of life is reflected in
