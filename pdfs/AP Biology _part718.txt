Oxygen usage is proportional to the rate of metabolism. BMR (basal
metabolic rate) is the metabolic rate of a resting, fasting, nonstressed
animal. Which of the following statements correctly describes what
is shown in this graph, regarding the metabolism of a mammal, and
provides the most likely reason for that occurrence?
As the ambient temperature increases, a mammalâ€™s metabolic
rate remains the same so that the animal can be active
throughout the day.
As the ambient temperature increases, the metabolic rate
increases so that the animal can remain active throughout the
day.
As the ambient temperature increases well above normal body
temperature, the animal must expend energy to cool itself
down.
As the
