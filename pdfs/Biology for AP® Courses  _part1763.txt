gene expression at many different levels. Eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA. This form
of regulation, called epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated.
The human genome encodes over 20,000 genes; each of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes encodes thousands of genes.
The DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. It
is also organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.
The first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins. Histones package and
order DNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions
(Figure 16.6a). Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks
like small beads on a string (Figure 16.6b). These beads (histone proteins) can move along t
