1.7.1 Long Division 
Dividing polynomials is much like the familiar process of dividing numbers. When we divide 
38 by 7, the quotient is 5 and the remainder is 3.  
 
If P(x) and D(x) are polynomials, with D(x) ≠ 0, then there exist unique polynomials Q(x) 
and R(x), where R(x) is either 0 or of degree less than the degree of D(x), such that 
 
The polynomials P(x) and D(x) are called the dividend and divisor, respectively, Q(x) is 
the quotient, and R(x) is the remainder. 
 
Example 1 
Divide 6x2 -26x +12 by x-4. 
Express the result in each of the two forms of division algorithm. 
 
 
 
 
 
1.7.2 Long Division 
Synthetic division is a quick method of dividing polynomials; it can be used when the 
divisor is of the form x − c.  
In synthetic division we write only the essential parts of the long division.  
Compare the following long and synthetic divisions, in which we divide
