however, for
a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water. Organisms like the salmon and
molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because
some fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. When they live in
fresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in Figure
32.3a. In such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water. Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine,
and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills. When they move to a hypertonic marine
environment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated
in Figure 32.3b. Most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water (osmoconformers). Their
body fl
