 other consumers which have
consumed these producers.
d.
Primary producers convert light energy through
chemosynthesis and consumers gain energy by
feeding on them or other consumers which have
consumed these producers.
37. In a microcosm experiment using fish tanks to mimic a
lake environment, an increase in the number of stickleback
species would increase the dissolved organic carbon
particle size. How could this affect primary producers in
the ecosystem?
a.
enhance growth rate
b.
increase abundance
c.
decrease abundance
d.
maintain growth rate
38. Studies on stickleback fish revealed that the presence
of two species of stickleback reduced the amount of algal

blooms relative to the presence of one species of
stickleback in a microcosm experiment. How does this
occur?
a.
This occurred as the presence of two species
caused an increase in dissolved organic carbon
molecule size, which blocked the penetration of
light in water and prevented algal
