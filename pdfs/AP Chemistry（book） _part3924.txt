ural formulas for the saponification (base hydrolysis) 
of (a) methyl propionate, (b) phenyl acetate.
 24.52  Write a balanced chemical equation using condensed 
structural formulas for (a) the formation of butyl propio-
nate from the appropriate acid and alcohol, (b) the saponi-
fication (base hydrolysis) of methyl benzoate.
 24.53  Pure acetic acid is a viscous liquid, with high melt-
ing and boiling points (16.7 °C and 118 °C) compared 
to compounds of similar molecular weight. Suggest an 
explanation.
 24.54  Acetic anhydride is formed from two acetic acid molecules, 
in a condensation reaction that involves the removal of 
a molecule of water. Write the chemical equation for this 
process, and show the structure of acetic anhydride.
 24.55  Write the condensed structural formula for each of the fol-
lowing compounds: (a) 2-pentanol, (b) 1,2-propanediol, 
 
(c) ethyl acetate, (d) diphenyl ketone, (e) methyl ethyl ether.
