2. Ozone depletion. The ozone layer forms in the upper atmosphere
 
when UV radiation reacts with oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3). The
ozone absorbs UV radiation and thus prevents it from reaching the surface of the earth, where it would damage the
DNA of plants and animals. Various air pollutants, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), enter the upper atmosphere
and break down ozone molecules. Although their manufacture has been phased out, CFCs were historically used as
refrigerants, as propellants in aerosol sprays, and in the manufacture of plastic foams. When ozone breaks down, the
ozone layer thins, allowing UV radiation to penetrate and reach the surface of the earth. Areas of major ozone
thinning, called ozone holes, appear regularly over Antarctica, the Arctic, and northern Eurasia.
3. Acid rain. The burning of fossil fuels (such as coal) and other industrial processes release into the air pollutants
that contain sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dio
