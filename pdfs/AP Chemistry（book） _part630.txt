electrolyte. Any substance that forms a solution containing no ions 
is a nonelectrolyte. Electrolytes that are present in solution entirely as 
ions are strong electrolytes, whereas those that are present partly as 
ions and partly as molecules are weak electrolytes. Ionic compounds 
dissociate into ions when they dissolve, and they are strong electrolytes. 
The solubility of ionic substances is made possible by solvation, the 
interaction of ions with polar solvent molecules. Most molecular 
compounds are nonelectrolytes, although some are weak electrolytes 
and a few are strong electrolytes. When representing the ionization 
of a weak electrolyte in solution, half-arrows in both directions are 
used, indicating that the forward and reverse reactions can achieve a 
chemical balance called a chemical equilibrium.
PRECIPITATION REACTIONS (SECTION 4.2) Precipitation reactions 
are those in which an insoluble product, called a precipitate, forms. 
Solubility guidelines help determine whe
