6. A population of flowers was separated into two
subpopulations when a new river cut through the plain in
which they were growing. The number of interbreeding
events per year for the two subpopulations of flowers is
shown in the graph below. Twenty-four years after they
were separated, can you conclude that the two
subpopulations of flowers have become new species? Why
or why not?

more common? Why?
a.
Allopatric speciation is more common because it
prevents gene flow between the species.
b.
Allopatric speciation is more common because it
involves stronger prezygotic barriers.
c.
Sympatric speciation is more common because it
prevents gene flow between the species.
d.
Sympatric speciation is more common because it
involves stronger prezygotic barriers.
