(b) true (c) false 19.27 (a) Positive ∆S (b) ∆S = 1.02 J  >  K (c) Tem-
perature need not be speciﬁed to calculate ∆S, as long as the expan-
sion is isothermal. 19.29 (a) Yes, the expansion is spontaneous.  
(b) As the ideal gas expands into the vacuum, there is nothing for it 
to “push back,” so no work is done. Mathematically, w = -P
ext∆V. 
Since the gas expands into a vacuum, P
ext = 0 and w = 0. (c) The 
a C ¬Cl bond is 365 nm. (b) We don’t expect the photodissociation 
of C ¬F bonds to be signiﬁcant in the lower atmosphere. (The photo-
dissociation of C ¬ Cl bonds will be signiﬁcant.)

(b) The CaSO4(s) would be much less reactive with acidic solution, since 
it would require a strongly acidic solution to shift the relevant equilib-
rium to the right: CaSO41s2 + 2H+1aq2 ∆Ca2+1aq2 + 2HSO4
-1aq2.
