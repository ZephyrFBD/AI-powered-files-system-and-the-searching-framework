 and determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent.
*64. (II) Assuming a constant pressure gradient, if blood flow 
is reduced by 65%, by what factor is the radius of a blood
vessel decreased?
*65. (II) Calculate the pressure drop per cm along the aorta
using the data of Example 10–12 and Table 10–3.
*66. (III) A patient is to be given a blood transfusion. The blood
is to flow through a tube from a raised bottle to a needle
inserted in the vein (Fig. 10–55). The inside
diameter of the 25-mm-long needle is
0.80 mm, and the required flow rate is
of blood per minute. How high h
should the bottle be placed above the
needle? Obtain and 
from the
Tables. Assume the blood
pressure is 78 torr above
atmospheric pressure.
