he population to change over time.
This lab specifically deals with Wisconsin Fast Plants. In order to artificially select for certain traits, plants with the
desired traits can be crossed, changing the genetic makeup of the population. For example, if you wanted to select
for height, you could cross only the tallest plants with one another. The new population will have a higher mean
height than the previous generation.
LAB 2: MATHEMATICAL MODELING: HARDY-WEINBERG
In order to understand everything you need for the AP Biology Exam, you need to be able to use the Hardy-
Weinberg principles and equations to determine allele frequencies in a population. One way to study evolution is to
study how the frequencies of alleles change from generation to generation:
Know how to calculate the allele and genotype frequencies using the two Hardy-Weinberg equations: p + q = 1
and p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. Don’t forget: if the population obeys Hardy-Weinberg’s rules, these frequencies remain
constant over ti
