that more energy has been invested into growing the fruit. (C) is thus
correct. The other choices are incorrect because they fail to identify
the methods that produce the largest fruit.
5. D

Some plants are capable of having a greater than normal number of
chromosomes, a condition known as polyploidy. When these plants
self-fertilize, they produce new plants with the same number of
chromosomes. Thus, if two diploid gametes came together, they
would form a tetraploid plant, from which other tetraploid plants
could be produced, (D). (A) is incorrect because a hexaploid plant
would produce triploid gametes. (B) is incorrect because the loss of
entire sets of chromosomes is an extremely rare event; two diploid
gametes would normally fuse to form a tetraploid organism. (C) is
incorrect because many polyploid plants are capable of reproduction.
