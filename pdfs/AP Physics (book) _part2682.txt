aterial with index of refraction greater than
that of the material in which it is traveling, changes phase by 180° or cycle;

If the 
index of refraction of the reflecting material is less than that of the material in
which the light is traveling, no phase shift occurs.†
Thus the wave reflected at the curved surface above the air gap in Fig. 24–31a
undergoes no change in phase. But the wave reflected at the lower surface, where
the beam in air strikes the glass, undergoes a
phase shift, equivalent to 
a
path difference. Thus the two waves reflected near the point of contact A of
the two glass surfaces (where the air gap approaches zero thickness) will be a half
cycle (or 180°) out of phase, and a dark spot occurs. Bright colored rings will occur
when the path difference is 
and so on, because the phase shift at one 
surface effectively adds a path difference of

light is used, the bright Newton’s rin
