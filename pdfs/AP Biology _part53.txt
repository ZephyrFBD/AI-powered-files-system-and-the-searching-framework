e. Protein
structure also depends on physical and chemical conditions in the
environment, such as pH, salt concentration, and temperature. Adverse
conditions alter the weak intramolecular forces, causing the protein to lose
its characteristic shape as well as its function, a phenomenon known as
denaturation or denaturing.
REMEMBER
A change in structure causes a change in function.
The concept that the shape or conformation of a protein determines
how it functions is a basic concept of modern biology. Scientists have yet
to discover all the rules about how proteins spontaneously fold into their
proper conformation. However, one important recent discovery is that
molecules called chaperone proteins or chaperonins assist in folding
other proteins. A misfolded protein, one with an incorrect shape, can
present a serious problem for a cell. Learning more about protein folding is
important. Many serious diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and
mad cow disease, result from the accumulat
