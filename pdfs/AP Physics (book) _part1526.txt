Unknown specific heat determined by calorimetry. An
engineer wishes to determine the specific heat of a new metal alloy. A 0.150-kg
sample of the alloy is heated to 540°C. It is then quickly placed in 0.400 kg of
water at 10.0°C, which is contained in a 0.200-kg aluminum calorimeter cup. The
final temperature of the system is 30.5°C. Calculate the specific heat of the alloy.
APPROACH We apply conservation of energy to our system, which we take to
be the alloy sample, the water, and the calorimeter cup. We assume this system
is isolated, and apply Eq. 14–3,
SOLUTION Each term is of the form
Thus 
gives
where the subscripts a, w, and cal refer to the alloy, water, and calorimeter,
respectively, and each 
is the final temperature (30.5°C) minus the initial
temperature for each object. When we put in values and use Table 14–1, this
equation becomes
or
Solving for 
we obtain:
NOTE We rounded off because we have ignored any heat transferred to the
thermometer and the stir
