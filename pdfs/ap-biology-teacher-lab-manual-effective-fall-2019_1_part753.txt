iterative negative geotaxis (RING): a new method for assessing age-related locomotor 
decline in Drosophila. Experimental Gerontology 40, no. 5 (May 2005): 386–395. 
Fruit flies’ negative geotaxis response declines with age. This resource would be 
helpful for teachers or students who have designed experiments that use the age of the 
fruit fly as a variable. 
http://www.hhmi.org The Howard Hughes Medical Center includes multiple 
resources for teachers about fruit flies. This is a general resource that could lead to 
ideas for experiments or general information about fruit flies before the class begins 
the experiments. It includes links to other resources for general information and the 
scope of research about Drosophila. This resource includes very accessible material 
that would be helpful as a teacher begins the experiments.
