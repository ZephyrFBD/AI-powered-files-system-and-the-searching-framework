r the mass of the neutron.)
 6.50  The electron microscope has been widely used to obtain 
highly magniﬁed images of biological and other types of 
materials. When an electron is accelerated through a par-
ticular potential ﬁeld, it attains a speed of 9.47 * 106 m>s. 
What is the characteristic wavelength of this electron? Is the 
wavelength comparable to the size of atoms?
 6.51  Using Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, calculate the uncer-
tainty in the position of (a) a 1.50-mg mosquito moving at a 
speed of 1.40 m>s if the speed is known to within {0.01 m>s; 
(b) a proton moving at a speed of 15.00 { 0.012 * 104 m>s. 
(The mass of a proton is given in the table of fundamental 
constants in the inside cover of the text.)
 6.52  Calculate the uncertainty in the position of (a) an electron 
moving at a speed of 13.00 { 0.012 * 105 m>s, (b) a neutron 
moving at this same speed. (The masses of an electron and 
a neutron are given in the table of fundamental constants
