o the different islands
and adapted to the different conditions on each.
39. Describe a situation where hybrid reproduction would
cause two species to fuse into one.
a.
Separate species cannot interbreed, so hybrid
reproduction does not occur in nature
b.
If the hybrid offspring are more fit than the
parents, reproduction would likely continue
between both species and the hybrids, eventually
bringing all organisms under the umbrella of one
species
c.
Two species that have recently diverged from
each other can reproduce with each other,
creating hybrid individuals that belong to the
species of the parents’ common ancestor.
d.
If two species occupy the same niche in the
same area, they can either compete or they can
collaborate and reproduce with each other,
eventually fusing into a single species
40. What do both rate of speciation models have in
common? Explain.
a.
Both models ignore the influence of gene flow
for simplicity’s sake.
b.
Both models apply only to island chains.
c.
Both m
