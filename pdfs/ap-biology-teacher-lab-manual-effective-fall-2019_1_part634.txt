ents develop the skills needed to monitor the biomass in growing 
plants and butterfly larvae. With the prelab work serving as a framework, the practical 
skill development, along with the insights that are gained growing the plants and 
butterfly larvae naturally, leads to focused, student-generated questions about the energy 
dynamics in the system. The skills acquired in Procedures are then put to use in the final 
part, Designing and Conducting Your Investigation. 
In this final part, the students work in teams to investigate their own questions. 
They present the results of that work in a miniature classroom poster presentation that 
simulates the poster sessions at meetings of professional societies. How students present 
their work often depends on class structure; for example, you might prefer that students 
keep a laboratory notebook.
