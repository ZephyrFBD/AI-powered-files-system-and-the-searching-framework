(a) At what rate is the Sun’s mass decreasing? (b) How
long does it take for the Sun to lose a mass equal to that 
of Earth? (c) Estimate how long the Sun could last if it
radiated constantly at this rate.
64. How much energy would be required to break a helium
nucleus into its constituents,
two protons and two
neutrons? The masses of a proton (including an electron),
a neutron, and neutral helium are, respectively, 1.00783 u,
1.00867 u, and 4.00260 u. (This energy difference is called
the total binding energy of the 
nucleus.)
