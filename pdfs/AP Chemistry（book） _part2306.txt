hich of the following mixtures will have the fastest

(a) Which chemical equation is consistent with these 
data:
 
(i) A ¡ B, (ii) B ¡ A, (iii) A ¡ 2 B,  
(iv) B ¡ 2 A?
(b) Write equivalent expressions for the rate of the reac-
tion in terms of the appearance or disappearance of 
the two substances. [Section 14.2]
 
14.4 Suppose that for the reaction K + L ¡ M, you moni-
tor the production of M over time, and then plot the fol-
lowing graph from your data:

 (a) Is the reaction occurring at a constant rate from t = 0 
to t = 15 min? (b) Is the reaction completed at t = 15 
min? (c) Suppose the reaction as plotted here were started 
with 0.20 mol K and 0.40 mol L. After 30 min, an addi-
tional 0.20 mol K are added to the reaction mixture. 
Which of the following correctly describes how the plot 
would look from t = 30 min to t = 60 min? (i) [M] would 
remain at the same constant value it has at t = 30 mi
