ons are similar; isotonic and
isosmotic both describe situations in which the concentration is the same on either side of a membrane, for example.
The only difference is what type of membrane.
Don’t Forget the Formula Sheet!
Be sure to look at the Equations and Formulas sheet to be prepared for
questions about water potential and solute potential.
Water potential (Ψ) is the measure of potential energy in water and describes the eagerness of water to flow from
an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. It is affected by two factors: pressure potential (Ψp)
and solute potential (Ψs). The equation for solute (osmotic) potential is listed on the AP Biology Equations and
Formulas sheet and describes the effect of solute concentration on water flow. Adding a solute lowers the water
potential of a solution, causing water to be less likely to leave this solution and more likely to flow into it. This
makes sense because the added solute makes the solution more concentrat
