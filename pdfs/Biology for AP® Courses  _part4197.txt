nment by simple diffusion, they have evolved many adaptations to retain water.
•
Plants have a number of interesting features on their leaves, such as leaf hairs and a waxy cuticle, that serve to decrease
the rate of water loss via transpiration.
•
Freshwater organisms are surrounded by water and are constantly in danger of having water rush into their cells
because of osmosis. Many adaptations of organisms living in freshwater environments have evolved to ensure that
solute concentrations in their bodies remain within appropriate levels. One such adaptation is the excretion of dilute
urine.
•
Marine organisms are surrounded by water with a higher solute concentration than the organism and, thus, are in
danger of losing water to the environment because of osmosis. These organisms have morphological and physiological
adaptations to retain water and release solutes into the environment. For example, Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus
cristatus), sneeze out water vapor that is high in salt in
