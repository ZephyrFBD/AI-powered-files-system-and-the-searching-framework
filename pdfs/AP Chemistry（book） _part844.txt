new 
substance? (c) Suppose that in changing samples, a portion 
of the water in the calorimeter were lost. In what way, if any, 
would this change the heat capacity of the calorimeter?
Hess’s Law (section 5.6)
 5.61 Can you use an approach similar to Hess’s law to calculate 
the change in internal energy, ∆E, for an overall reaction by 
summing the ∆E values of individual reactions that add up 
to give the desired overall reaction?
 5.62 Consider the following hypothetical reactions:
 
A  ¡ B
 
∆H = +30 kJ 
B  ¡  C  
∆H = +60 kJ
 
 (a)  
Use Hess’s law to calculate the enthalpy change for the 
reaction A ¡  C.
 
 (b)  
Construct an enthalpy diagram for substances A, B, and 
C, and show how Hess’s law applies.
 5.63 Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction
 
 
P4O61s2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  P4O101s2
 
 given the following enthalpies of reaction:
 
 
P41s2 + 3 O21g2 ¡ P4O61s2  
∆H = -1640.1 kJ 
 
 
P41s2 + 5 O21g2 ¡ P4O101s2  
∆H = -2940.1 kJ
