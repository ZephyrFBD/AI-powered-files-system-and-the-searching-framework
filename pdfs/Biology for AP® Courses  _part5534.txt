fections may have been
‘dramatically inﬂated’. Oh, just a liĴle bit. The CDC in America
issued new guidance to laboratories in April, 2021, to use 28 cycles
but only for ‘vaccinated’ people. The timing of the CDC/WHO
interventions were cynically designed to make it appear the
‘vaccines’ were responsible for falling cases and deaths when the real
reason can be seen in the following examples. New York’s state lab,
the Wadsworth Center, identiﬁed 872 positive tests in July, 2020,
based on a threshold of 40 cycles. When the ﬁgure was lowered to 35
cycles 43 percent of the 872 were no longer ‘positives’. At 30 cycles
the ﬁgure was 63 percent. A MassachuseĴs lab found that between
85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle
threshold of 40 would be negative at 30 cycles, Ashish Jha, MD,
director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said: ‘I’m really
shocked that it could be that high … Boy, does it really change the
way we need to be thinking about testing.’ I’m sh
