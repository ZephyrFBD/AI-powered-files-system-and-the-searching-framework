protons, neutrons, and electrons. Let’s take a look
at a typical atom.
Protons and neutrons are particles that are packed together in the core of an atom called the nucleus. You’ll notice
that protons are positively charged (+) particles, whereas neutrons are uncharged particles.
Electrons, on the other hand, are negatively charged (–) particles that spin around the nucleus. Electrons are pretty
small compared to protons and neutrons. In fact, for our purposes, electrons are considered massless. Most atoms
have the same number of protons and electrons, making them electrically neutral. Some atoms have the same
number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. These atoms are called isotopes.
Carbon-14 Isotopes
Some isotopes are radioactive and decay predictably over time. Ancient
artifacts can be dated by examining the rate of decay of carbon-14 and other
isotopes within the artifact. This process is called radiometric dating.
