ito strain that is susceptible to 
the insecticides displayed at least 95% mortality in all experiments, and mosquitoes 
exposed to untreated filter paper displayed less than 10% mortality. Error bars 
represent standard deviation. “ND” means no data are available.

(a) Describe the most likely cause of the amino acid substitution in the sodium 
channel protein. Explain how the substitution of a single amino acid in the 
channel protein could cause pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes.
(b) Identify the dependent variable in the experiment whose data are graphed in
