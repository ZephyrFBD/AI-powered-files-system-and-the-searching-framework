ffect of the Sun. The Sun
emits not only visible light but substantial amounts of IR and UV (ultraviolet) as
well. The molecules of our skin tend to “resonate” at infrared frequencies, so it is
these that are preferentially absorbed and thus warm us. We humans experience
EM waves differently depending on their wavelengths: Our eyes detect wavelengths
between about 
and 
(visible light), whereas our skin detects
longer wavelengths (IR). Many EM wavelengths we don’t detect directly at all.

Light as an Electromagnetic Wave and the Electromagnetic Spectrum

Light and other electromagnetic waves travel at a speed of 
Compare this to sound, which travels (see Chapter 12) at a speed of about 
in air, a million times slower; or to typical freeway speeds of a car,
(
or 
), 10 million times slower than light. EM waves differ from sound waves
in another big way: sound waves travel in a medium such as air, and involve
motion of air molecules; EM waves do not
