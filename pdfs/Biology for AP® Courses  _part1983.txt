ures. This phenomenon is called convergent evolution,
where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry. The two species came to the same
function, flying, but did so separately from each other.
These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs. Natural selection acts on
individual organisms, which in turn can shape an entire species. Although natural selection may work in a single generation
on an individual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for the genotype of an entire species to evolve. It is over
these large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change.
Evidence of Evolution
The evidence for evolution is compelling and extensive. Looking at every level of organization in living systems, biologists
see the signature of past and present evolution. Darwin dedicated a large portion of his book, On the Origin of Species, to
identifying patterns in nature that were con
