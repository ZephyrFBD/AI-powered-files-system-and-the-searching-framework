STUDY TIP
Organisms use feedback mechanisms to regulate growth and reproduction and to maintain
dynamic equilibrium.
REMEMBER
Signal transduction pathways link signal reception with cellular response.
HOW HORMONES TRIGGER A RESPONSE IN TARGET
CELLS
There are two types of hormones, and they stimulate target cells in
different ways. They are illustrated in Figures 16.1 and 16.2.
Lipid or steroid hormones diffuse directly through the plasma
membrane and bind to a receptor inside the nucleus that triggers the

Figure 16.1 How Steroid Hormones Trigger a Response in a Cell
STUDY TIP
Know the two types of hormones and how each affects its target cells.
Protein or polypeptide hormones (nonsteroidal) cannot dissolve in
the plasma membrane, so they bind to a receptor on the surface of the
cell. Once the hormone (the first messenger) binds to a receptor on the
surface of the cell, it triggers a
