5. To understand the spread of genes associated with herbicide
resistance, researchers planted a herbicide-resistant strain of
Lolium rigidum (annual ryegrass) plant surrounded by herbicide-
susceptible plants to examine the spread of resistance genes by
pollen. The table below shows the percent of pollen-mediated
gene flow at varying distances (0, 1, 5, 10, and 15 meters) from the
resistant plant.
