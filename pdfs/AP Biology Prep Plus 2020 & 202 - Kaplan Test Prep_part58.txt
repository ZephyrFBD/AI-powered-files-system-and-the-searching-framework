Panting dissipates heat from the body when that heat
radiates from the open nose and mouth.
(A)
Panting decreases the core temperature of the reindeer when
moisture from the lining of the nose and mouth evaporate
into the air.
(B)
Water in saliva has a high heat capacity and absorbs excess
heat from the environment.
(C)
Panting removes water from the surface of the tongue,
allowing reindeer to absorb more heat from the water they
drink.
(D)
3. Animals store glucose in the liver as a polymer called glycogen.
Plants store glucose as a diﬀerent polymer called starch. Cellulose
is another polymer that is an important part of producing strong
plant cell walls. Although cellulose is also a
