se Audit, a 
process through which AP teachers’ course materials 
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit 
was created to provide teachers and administrators 
with clear guidelines on curricular and resource 
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and 
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’ 
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’ 
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource 
expectations that college and secondary school faculty 
have established for college-level courses.

The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher 
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to 
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular 
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline, 
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted 
by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
