here is excess 
strong base at the equivalence point. (b) There is excess weak 
acid at the equivalence point. (c) The conjugate base that is 
formed at the equivalence point is a strong base.  
(d) The conjugate base that is formed at the equivalence 
point reacts with water. (e) This statement is false: the pH is 
always 7 at an equivalence point in a pH titration.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the pH at the equivalence point when (a) 40.0 mL 
of 0.025 M benzoic acid 1C6H5COOH, Ka = 6.3 * 10-52 is 
titrated with 0.050 M NaOH and (b) 40.0 mL of 0.100 M NH3 
is titrated with 0.100 M HCl.
In order to further monitor the evolution of pH as a function of added base, we can 
calculate the pH at the equivalence point.

x = 3OH-4 = 5.3 * 10-6 M,  
which gives pOH = 5.28 and pH = 8.72

CHAPTER 17 Additional Aspects of Aqueous Equilibria
The titration curve for a weak acid–strong base titration (Figure 17.9) differs from the 
curve for a strong
