0 = the factor by
which the reaction
rate increases when
the temperature is
raised by ten degrees
SURFACE AREA AND VOLUME
Volume of a Sphere
V = 
πr3
Volume of a Rectangular
Solid
V = lwh
Volume of a Right Cylinder
V = πr2h
Surface Area of a Sphere
A = 4πr2
r = radius
l = length
h = height
w = width
s = length of one side
of a cube
A = surface area
V = volume
∑ = sum of all
Dilution (used to create a dilute
solution from a concentrated stock
solution)
CiVi = CfVf
i = initial (starting)
C = concentration of solute
f = final (desired)
V = volume of solution
Gibbs Free Energy
Surface Area of a Cube
A = 6s2
Surface Area of a
Rectangular Solid
A = ∑ (surface area of each
side)
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
ΔG = change in Gibbs free energy
ΔS = change in entropy
ΔH = change in enthalpy
T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)
pH = − log10 [H+]
