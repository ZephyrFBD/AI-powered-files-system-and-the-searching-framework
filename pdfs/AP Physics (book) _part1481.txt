18. (II) A certain car has 14.0 L of liquid coolant circulating at a
temperature of 93°C through the engine’s cooling system.
Assume that, in this normal condition, the coolant com-
pletely fills the 3.5-L volume of the aluminum radiator and
the 10.5-L internal cavities within the aluminum engine. When
a car overheats, the radiator, engine, and coolant expand
and a small reservoir connected to the radiator catches any
resultant coolant overflow. Estimate how much coolant
overflows to the reservoir if the system goes from 93°C 
to 105°C. Model the radiator and engine as hollow shells
of aluminum. The coefficient of volume expansion for
coolant is
*19. (II) An aluminum bar has the desired length when at 12°C.
How much stress is required to keep it at this length if the
temperature increases to 35°C? [See T
