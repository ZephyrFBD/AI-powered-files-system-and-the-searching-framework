onment will 
increase, and therefore the transpiration rate increases. The 
student is unable to recognize that above 60 percent open 
stomata there must be another limiting factor, such as no 
difference in vapor pressure between the leaf interior and  
the environment. 
(Part d) The student is able to connect one of the organisms 
to an environment, such as water lilies to a body of water 
but is unable to justify the decision or is very general in  
the justifications.

Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 2
10 points maximum; students must earn points in each part of the question to receive 
all 10 points.
(Part a) Up to 3 points for a properly drawn graph. 
One point for each of the following:
• 
Axes properly labeled and scaled
• 
Points properly plotted
• 
Correctly drawing either the curve with connected points or the best-fit 
line 
NOTE: The student may use full scale (0–30), limited scale (20–30), or other legitimate 
scaling of the x-axis. Two examples
