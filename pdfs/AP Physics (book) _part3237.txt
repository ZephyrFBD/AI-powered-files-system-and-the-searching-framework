en molecules due to simple electrostatic attraction—such as
between polar molecules (and not within a polar molecule, which is a strong
bond). The strength of the attachment is much less than for the strong bonds.
Binding energies are typically in the range 0.04 to 0.3 eV—hence their name
“weak bonds.”
Weak bonds are generally the result of attraction between dipoles. (A pair of
equal point charges q of opposite sign, separated by a distance 
is called an
electric dipole, as we saw in Chapter 17.) For example, Fig. 29–11 shows two mole-
cules, which have permanent dipole moments, attracting one another. Besides such
dipole;dipole bonds, there can also be dipole;induced dipole bonds, in which a
polar molecule with a permanent dipole moment can induce a dipole moment in
an otherwise electrically balanced (nonpolar) molecule, just as a single charge
can induce a separation of charge in a nearby object (see Fig. 16–7). There can
even be an attraction between two nonpolar molecules, because
