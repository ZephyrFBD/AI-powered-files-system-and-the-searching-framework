ts lower Simpson’s Diversity Index means that few
species will be affected.
(B) Tidal marshland B is more likely to recover, because its higher Simpson’s Diversity Index means it has a
wider variety of species and can better absorb the effects of a disturbance.
(C) Both ecosystems will be equally affected, because they are the same distance from the oil spill.
(D) Neither ecosystem will be able to recover, because oil is toxic to all organisms.

11. A population of 45 geese are introduced to a lake. The birth rate of the population is 0.28 geese per year, and
the death rate is 0.18 geese per year.
(a) Calculate the rate of population growth.
(b) Determine whether the population of geese is increasing or decreasing.
(c) The carrying capacity for geese at this lake is about 80 geese. Make a prediction about the population of
geese relative to the lake’s carrying capacity for geese in the next 10 years.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
