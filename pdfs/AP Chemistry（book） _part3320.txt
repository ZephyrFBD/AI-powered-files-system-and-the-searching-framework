water 
makes hydrogen gas plus oxygen gas? (b) Using the stan-
dard reduction potentials in Appendix E, calculate the 
standard voltage generated by the hydrogen fuel cell in 
acidic solution.
 20.82  (a) What is the difference between a battery and a fuel cell? 
(b) Can the “fuel” of a fuel cell be a solid?
Corrosion (Section 20.8)
 20.83  (a) Write the anode and cathode reactions that cause the 
corrosion of iron metal to aqueous iron(II). (b) Write the 
balanced half-reactions involved in the air oxidation of 
Fe2+1aq2 to Fe2O3 # 3 H2O1s2.
 20.84  (a) Based on standard reduction potentials, would you 
expect copper metal to oxidize under standard conditions 
in the presence of oxygen and hydrogen ions? (b) When 
the Statue of Liberty was refurbished, Teflon spacers were 
placed between the iron skeleton and the copper metal on 
the surface of the statue. What role do these spacers play?
 20.85  (a) Magnesium metal is used as a sacrificial anode to pro-
tect underground pipes from co
