w is invaded by shrubs and trees from the
surrounding area. In a temperate mountain habitat, the climax community may be a deciduous forest consisting of
oaks or maples. In colder regions, the climax community is often a coniferous forest, consisting of pines, firs, and
hemlocks.
b. Eutrophication is the increase in inorganic nutrients and biomass of a lake. Eutrophication occurs in both
unpolluted as well as polluted lakes. In the natural succession of the lake described above, eutrophication occurred
slowly over a period of dozens of years (perhaps over a hundred years). As a result, changes in the chemical and
physical nature of the lake allowed for the orderly change of communities, each new community suitable for the new
conditions.
In polluted lakes, eutrophication is accelerated by effluent from sewage or fertilizer. As a result, algae growth occurs
rapidly over a period of months. At high densities, algae reduce oxygen levels when they respire at night. When the
algae die as sh
