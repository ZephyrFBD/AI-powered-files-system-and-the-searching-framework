d distinguish between
eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells contain lipids, cytosol, and proteins.
Therefore, the dyes that stain these (Nile red, DRAQ9, and Coomassie blue, respectively) would not distinguish
between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, making choices (A), (C), and (D) incorrect.
7. (B) Small, hydrophobic molecules can slide between the phospholipids in the cell membrane and therefore can
cross the cell membrane most easily. Choice (A) is incorrect because hydrophilic molecules could not get past
the long hydrophobic lipid tails of the phospholipids that make up the cell membraneâ€™s bilayer. Large molecules
cannot pass through the cell membrane unassisted, so choices (C) and (D) are incorrect.
8. (D) The function of the Golgi complex is to modify and package proteins. Ribosomes synthesize proteins, so
choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes, which break
down macromolecules and cell par
