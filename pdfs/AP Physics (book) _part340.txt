the vector sum of all forces acting on the object, which we define as
the net force.
We rearrange this equation to obtain the familiar statement of Newton’s
second law:
(4;1)
Newton’s second law relates the description of motion to the cause of motion,
force. It is one of the most fundamental relationships in physics. From Newton’s
second law we can make a more precise definition of force as an action capable 
of accelerating an object.
Every force 
is a vector, with magnitude and direction. Equation 4–1 is 
a vector equation valid in any inertial reference frame. It can be written in 
component form in rectangular coordinates as
If the motion is all along a line (one-dimensional), we can leave out the sub-
scripts and simply write 
Again, a is the acceleration of an object of
mass m, and 
includes all the forces acting on that object, and only forces
acting on that object. (Sometimes the net force 
is written as
so  
.)
In SI units, with the mass in kilograms, the unit of force is cal
