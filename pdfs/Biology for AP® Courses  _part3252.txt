to the bipolar cells, and then to ganglion cells. A large degree of processing
of visual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain.
Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity. That is, they are always slightly active even when not
stimulated by light. In neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while
some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate. In the absence of light, the
bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones.
Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells. The now
active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the
eye as the optic nerve). Thus, the visual system relies on change in retinal acti
