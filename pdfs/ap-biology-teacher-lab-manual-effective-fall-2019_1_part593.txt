New England Biolabs has an extensive selection of DNA markers cut with several 
restriction enzymes, including HindIII, HaeIII, and BstEII, as well as standardized 
1000-bp and 100-bp standards. NEB also sells ladder DNA made from plasmids 
(pBR322) and the Phi-Chi X174 virus, giving teachers options for “suspect” DNA 
samples in the crime scene scenario. The NEB catalog (both in print and online) is a 
treasure trove of information, including images of the precut DNAs. Their 1kb and 
100bp ladders are particularly helpful for demonstrating the log relationship between 
mobility and size.
