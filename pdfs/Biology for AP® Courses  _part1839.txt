igestion in E. coli begins with its hydrolysis
by the enzyme β -galactosidase. The gene encoding β
-galactosidase, lacZ, is part of a coordinately regulated
operon containing other genes required for lactose
utilization. Which of the following figures correctly
depicts the interactions at the lac operon when lactose is
not being utilized?
a.
b.
c.
d.
45. What would be the result of a mutation in the repressor
protein that prevented it from binding lactose?
a.
The repressor will bind to lactose when it is
removed from the operator.
b.
The repressor will bind the operator in the
presence of lactose.
c.
The repressor will not bind the operator in the
presence of lactose.
d.
The repressor will not bind the operator in the
absence of lactose.
46. What type of modification might be observed in the
GR gene in all newborn rats?
a.
The DNA will have many methyl molecules.
b.
The DNA will have many acetyl molecules.
c.
The DNA will have few methyl groups.
d.
The histones will have many acetyl gr
