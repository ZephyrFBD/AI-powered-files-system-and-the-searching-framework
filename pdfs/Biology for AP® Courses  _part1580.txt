witched to 14 N media, DNA sedimented
halfway between the 15 N and 14 N levels after
one round of cell division, indicating complete
presence of 14 N . This supports the semi-
conservative replication model.
43. Explain why half of DNA is replicated in a
discontinuous fashion.
a.
Replication of the lagging strand occurs in the
direction away from the replication fork in short
stretches of DNA, since access to the DNA is
always from the 5’ end. This results in pieces of
DNA being replicated in a discontinuous
fashion.
b.
Replication of the leading strand occurs in the
direction away from the replication fork in short
stretches of DNA, since access to the DNA is
always from the 5’ end. This results in pieces of
DNA being replicated in a discontinuous
fashion.
c.
Replication of the lagging strand occurs in the
direction of the replication fork in short stretches
of DNA, since access to the DNA is always from
the 5’ end. This results in pieces of DNA being
replicated in a discontinuous fas
