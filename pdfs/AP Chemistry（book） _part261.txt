d or downward by the electric field?
Thomson constructed a cathode-ray tube having a hole in the anode through which 
the cathode rays could pass. Electrically charged plates and a magnet were positioned per-
pendicular to the beam, and a fluorescent screen that would give off light when struck with 
a cathode ray was located at one end (Figure 2.4). Because the electron is a negatively charged 
particle, the electric field deflected the rays in one direction, and the magnetic field deflected 
them in the opposite direction. Thomson adjusted the strengths of the fields so that the 
effects balanced each other, allowing the electrons to travel in a straight path to the screen. 
Knowing the strengths that resulted in the straight path made it possible to calculate a value 
of 1.76 * 108 coulombs* per gram for the ratio of the electron’s electrical charge to its mass.
