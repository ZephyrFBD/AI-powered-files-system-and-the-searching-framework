compared to the root sap, the osmotic pressure gradient is
reversed, and so the plant has to actively pump more ions into the root to
take in water. Thus, (B) is correct. (A) and (D) express the opposite of what
would actually happen, while (C) is an untrue statement because the
tonicity of the fluids on either side of a cell membrane wonâ€™t change the
permeability of the membrane.

Since oxygen is produced as a result of photosynthesis, it is directly
related to the amount of leafy biomass that a plant has. Thus, the more
biomass, the more photosynthesis, and the greater the oxygen
production. Since plants grown in Sample 3 soil had the lowest biomass,
they would be expected to have the least photosynthetic ability, and
therefore produce the least oxygen. (C) is the correct answer.
45. D
At the point indicated by the arrow, the blood pressure has dipped below
the set point. That means that the body will act to increase the blood
pressure. Vasoconstriction, or narrowing the arterio
