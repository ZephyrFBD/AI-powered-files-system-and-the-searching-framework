through transpiration. Too much water loss can be detrimental to plants; they 
can wilt and die.
The transport of water upward from roots to shoots in the xylem is governed by 
differences in water (or osmotic) potential, and these differences account for water 
movement from cell to cell or over long distances in the plant. Several factors, including 
environmental pressure and solute concentration, contribute to water potential, with 
water always moving from an area of high water potential (higher free energy, more 
water) to lower potential (less free energy, less water). The process is facilitated by 
osmosis, root pressure, and the physical and chemical properties of water. Transpiration 
creates a lower osmotic potential in the leaf, and the TACT (transpiration, adhesion, 
cohesion, and tension) mechanism describes the forces that move water and dissolved 
nutrients up the xylem, as modeled in Figure 1.
