he carbon 
atoms are then incorporated into an appropriate compound. 
The resulting sample is injected into a patient, and the med-
ical image is obtained. If the entire process takes five half-
lives, what percentage of the original carbon-11 remains at 
this time?
Radiometric Dating
Because the half-life of any particular nuclide is constant, the half-life can serve as a 
“nuclear clock” to determine the age of objects. The method of dating objects based on 
their isotopes and isotope abundances is called radiometric dating.
When carbon-14 is used in radiometric dating, the technique is known as radio-
carbon dating. The procedure is based on the formation of carbon-14 as neutrons 
created by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere convert nitrogen-14 into carbon-14 
(Figure 21.7). The 14C reacts with oxygen to form 14CO2 in the atmosphere, and this 
“labeled” CO2 is taken up by plants and introduced into the food chain through 
photosynthesis. This process provides a small but reasonabl
