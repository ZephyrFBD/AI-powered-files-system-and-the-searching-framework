a
because these organelles have a single membrane.
b.
Chloroplasts and mitochondria likely evolved later in eukaryotic cells, as these organelles show no
similarities to prokaryotes.
c.
Chloroplasts and mitochondria came about through endosymbiosis with Archaea and gram positive bacteria
because these organelles have prokaryote-like DNA.
d.
Chloroplasts and mitochondria came about through endosymbiosis with gram-negative bacteria because
these organelles have a double membrane.
Building Phylogenetic Trees
How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? After the homologous and analogous traits are sorted, scientists often
organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics. This system sorts organisms into clades: groups of
organisms that descended from a single ancestor. For example, in Figure 20.10, all of the organisms in the orange region
evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs. Consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and
make a single
