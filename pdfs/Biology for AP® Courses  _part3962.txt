unity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to
infections during the first few months of life.
Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated in Figure 33.24, by blocking key sites on the
pathogen that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that “dock” pathogens on host cells). Antibody neutralization can
prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are
already infected to prevent progression of an established infection. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be
filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.

pathogen for destruction by macrophages or neutrophils, or (c) act
