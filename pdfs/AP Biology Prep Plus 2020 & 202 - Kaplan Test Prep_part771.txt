 Birds instinctively know how to build nests, and nest
building occurs when both internal stimuli (hormonal signals) and
external stimuli (proper nest building materials) are present. Innate
behaviors that increase the organism’s ability to survive and reproduce
will persist in a population and be passed from one generation to the
next. A change in innate behavior occurs only if a genetic mutation arises,
and the altered behavior would develop over many generations. Other
examples of innate behavioral responses include taxes (singular: taxis)
(movements by the entire body) and reflexes (movements by individual
muscles). For instance, chemotaxis involves the response to chemical
gradients, and a reflex to the sensation of pain is avoidance.
Learned behaviors, the opposite of innate behaviors, are acquired or
lost through interacting with the world or through teaching. Young geese
and other birds learn via imprinting, in which they follow an object
