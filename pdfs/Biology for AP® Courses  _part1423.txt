dihybrid flies produces more parental-type offspring than recombinant-type offspring. How
can you explain these observed results?
Genetic Markers for Cancers
Scientists have used genetic linkage to discover the location in the human genome of many genes that
cause disease. They locate disease genes by tracking inheritance of traits through generations of families
and creating linkage maps that measure recombination among groups of genetic “markers.” The two BRCA
genes, mutations which can lead to breast and ovarian cancers, were some of the first genes discovered by
genetic mapping. Women who have family histories of these cancers can now be screened to determine if
one or both of these genes carry a mutation. If so, they can opt to have their breasts and ovaries surgically
removed. This decreases their chances of getting cancer later in life. The actress Angelia Jolie brought
this to the public’s attention when she opted for surgery in 2014 and again in 2015 after doctors found she
