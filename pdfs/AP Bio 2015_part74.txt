the hypothesis that a particular plant 
synthesizes storage lipids by using glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate (G3P) from photosynthesis, a 
researcher plans to use radiolabeled precursors  
to track the molecules through the biosynthetic 
pathway. Which of the following radiolabeled 
precursors is most appropriate for the researcher 
to use? 
(A)  15N-labeled N2, because atmospheric nitrogen 
is fixed to amino acids by photosynthesis 
(B)  14C-labeled CO2, because atmospheric carbon 
is fixed to carbohydrates by photosynthesis 
(C)  35S-labeled methionine, because amino acids 
are incorporated into lipids during 
photosynthesis 
(D)  32P-labeled phosphate, because lipids are 
stored in plants as phospholipids

39. Mutations in DNA are usually caused by chemical or radiation damage to DNA molecules, followed by 
imperfect repair of the damage. Immediately after
