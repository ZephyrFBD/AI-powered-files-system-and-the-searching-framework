Force between

wo Wires
25. (I) Jumper cables used to start a stalled vehicle often carry
a 65-A current. How strong is the magnetic field 4.5 cm
from one cable? Compare to the Earth’s magnetic field
26. (I) If an electric wire is allowed to produce a magnetic field
no larger than that of the Earth 
at a distance
of 12 cm from the wire, what is the maximum current the
wire can carry?
27. (I) Determine the magnitude and direction of the force
between two parallel wires 25 m long and 4.0 cm apart,
each carrying 25 A in the same direction.
28. (I) A vertical straight wire carrying an upward 28-A current
exerts an attractive force per unit length of 
on a second parallel wire 9.0 cm away. What current 
(magnitude and direction) flows in the second wire?
29. (II) In Fig.20–54, a long straight wire carries current I out of
the page toward you. Indicate, with appropriate arrows, the
direction and (relative)
