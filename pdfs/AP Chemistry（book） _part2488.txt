a) Is the dissociation of fluorine molecules into atomic 
fluorine, F2(g) ∆2 F(g) an exothermic or endothermic 
process? (b) If the temperature is raised by 100 K, does 
the equilibrium constant for this reaction increase or 
decrease? (c)  If the temperature is raised by 100 K, does 
the forward rate constant kf increase by a larger or smaller 
amount than the reverse rate constant kr?
 15.70 True or false: When the temperature of an exothermic 
reaction increases, the rate constant of the forward reac-
tion decreases, which leads to a decrease in the equilib-
rium constant, Kc.

following equilibrium are believed to be elementary steps:
CO1g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ COCl1g2 + Cl1g2
 
 At 25 °C, the rate constants for the forward and reverse 
reactions are 1.4 * 10-28 M-1 s-1 and 9.3 * 1010 M-1 s-1, 
respectively. (a) What is the value for the equilibrium 
constant at 25 °C? (b) Are reactants or products more
