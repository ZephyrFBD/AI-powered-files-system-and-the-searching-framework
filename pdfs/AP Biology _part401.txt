Their bodies consist of ectoderm,
endoderm, and mesoglea (middle glue), which connects the two layers
together.
Bilateral Symmetry
Whereas primitive animals exhibit no symmetry or radial symmetry (see
Figure 10.3), most sophisticated animals exhibit bilateral symmetry (see
Figure 10.2). The echinoderms seem to be an exception because they

exhibit bilateral symmetry only as larvae and revert to radial symmetry as
adults. In bilateral symmetry, the body is organized along a longitudinal
axis with right and left sides that mirror each other.

Cephalizationâ€”Development of a Head End
Along with bilateral symmetry comes a front end (anterior) and a rear end
(posterior). Sensory apparatus and a brain are clustered at the anterior,
while digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems are located at the
posterior. This enabl
