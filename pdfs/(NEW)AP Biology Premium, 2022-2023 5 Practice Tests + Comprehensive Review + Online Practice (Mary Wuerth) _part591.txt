plastic beads of roughly equal volumes to the respiring
organisms are placed in a second respirometer as a control.
At room temperature, glucose and water are in the solid and liquid states, respectively, so their contributions to
any change in volume in the respiring system is minimal. As oxygen gas is consumed during respiration, carbon
dioxide is produced, balancing out any potential change in the volume of the gases present. However, potassium
hydroxide (KOH) solution reacts with carbon dioxide gas to form a solid potassium carbonate salt, as shown in the
following equation:
If a few drops of potassium hydroxide solution are added to the respirometer, any carbon dioxide produced will
be precipitated into the potassium carbonate salt. The result is that any change in volume in the gases in the
respirometer is the result of the consumption of oxygen gas. Thus, this allows the rate of cellular respiration to be
assayed.
The respirometers can be placed in environments with different te
