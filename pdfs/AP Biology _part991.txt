Questions 43 and 44
A scientist wanted to understand the role of the gonads and their hormones
in the development of the sex of an individual. He carried out an
experiment on 2 groups of pregnant rabbits. One group was the control
group, on which he performed a sham surgery. The other group was the
experimental group, on which he performed surgery on the embryos at a
stage before sex differences were observable. He surgically removed the
portion of each embryo that would develop into ovaries or testes. When
the babies were born, he made note of their chromosome sex and the
sexual differentiation of the genitals. His data is presented in the table
below:
