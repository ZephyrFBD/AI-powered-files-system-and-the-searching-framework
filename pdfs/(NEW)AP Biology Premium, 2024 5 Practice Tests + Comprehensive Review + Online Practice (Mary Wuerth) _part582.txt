ute is added to a solution, the relative amount of water in the solution decreases. As the amount of solute in
a solution increases, the solute potential, and consequently the total water potential, decreases. Further details on
how solute potential is calculated are discussed in Chapter 6.
This investigation can be divided into multiple parts, as in the following scenario.
Part 1: Artificial cells are made from agar or gelatin cubes impregnated with an indicator dye that can be used to
track the movement of a solution into the artificial cell. Cubes of three different sizes, with three different surface
area to volume ratios, are used, as described in the table.
The cubes are placed into a solution, and the dye in the cubes is used to track the movement of the solution into
the cells. This part of the lab demonstrates that smaller cells, with their higher surface area to volume ratios, are
more efficient at taking in materials from their environment.
Part 2: In this part of the invest
