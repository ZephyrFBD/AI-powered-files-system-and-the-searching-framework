ientific question.
Learning Objective 
1.21: The student is able to design a plan for collecting 
data to investigate the scientific claim that speciation and 
extinction have occurred throughout Earth,s history.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the number of fossils is not directly related to  
any period. 
(B)
This option is correct because it indicates that a student is able to design a 
plan for collecting data concerning speciation and extinction throughout 
the Earthâ€™s history. The Devonian period prior to the Permian period did not 
contain vertebrates, which evolved later. Thus, an area prior to the Permian 
that contains a few early vertebrates would indicate the Devonian/Permian 
boundary, which would be an appropriate place for students to collect  
fossil data. 
(C)
This option is incorrect because trilobites existed in the Permian, not the 
Devonian, period.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the rate of speciation is not related to the location 
of Devonian fossils.
