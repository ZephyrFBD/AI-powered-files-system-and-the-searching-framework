aged over the sunlit half of Earth is 680 W>m2 (assuming 
no clouds). The area of Earth’s disc as seen from the Sun is 
1.28 * 1014 m2. The surface area of Earth is approximately 
197,000,000 square miles. How much of Earth’s surface 
would we need to cover with solar energy collectors to power 
the planet for use by all humans? Assume that the solar en-
ergy collectors can convert only 10% of the available sun-
light into useful power.
