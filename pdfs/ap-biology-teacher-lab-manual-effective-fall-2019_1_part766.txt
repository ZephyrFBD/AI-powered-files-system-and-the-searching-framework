riment about environmental variables and 
behavior? 
•  What is the difference among phototaxis, chemotaxis, and geotaxis? Do fruit flies 
demonstrate all of them? 
•  Does a phototactic response override a chemotactic response? 
•  Does the age of the fruit fly change its geotactic response? 
•  Are there other organisms that respond the same as fruit flies? Are there other  
organisms that respond differently from fruit flies?  
■ Analyzing Results 
Look for patterns in fly behavior based on the number and ratio of fruit flies on different 
ends of your choice chamber. How will you determine which of the substances stimulate 
the greatest negative chemotactic response and positive chemotactic response? Do you 
see any patterns about materials or forces to which fruit flies are attracted? 
Develop a method for sharing your results and conclusions to classmates — and then 
share them!
