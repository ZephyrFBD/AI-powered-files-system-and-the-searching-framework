actions involving 
electrolytes. For example, Equation 4.7 expresses the essential feature of the precipita-
tion reaction between any strong electrolyte containing Pb2+1aq2 and any strong electro-
lyte containing I-1aq): The ions combine to form a precipitate of PbI2. Thus, a net ionic 
equation demonstrates that more than one set of reactants can lead to the same net reac-
tion. For example, aqueous solutions of KI and MgI2 share many chemical similarities 
because both contain I- ions. Either solution when mixed with a Pb1NO322 solution pro-
duces PbI21s2. The complete ionic equation, however, identifies the actual reactants that 
participate in a reaction.
How to Write a Net Ionic Equation
 
1. Write a balanced molecular equation for the reaction.
 
2. Rewrite the equation to show the ions that form in solution when each soluble 
strong electrolyte dissociates into its ions. Only strong electrolytes dissolved in aqueous 
solution are written in ionic form.
 
3. Identify and cancel
