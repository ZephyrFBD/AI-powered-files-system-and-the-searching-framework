 the process, NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
CITRIC ACID CYCLE
The citric acid cycle is also known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic
acid cycle (TCA cycle). The cycle begins when the two-carbon acetyl
group from acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon
molecule, to form the six-carbon citrate. Through a complicated series of
reactions, 2 CO2 are released, and oxaloacetate is regenerated for use in
another turn of the cycle.

The Citric Acid Cycle
For each turn of the citric acid cycle, 1 ATP is produced by substrate level
phosphorylation via a GTP intermediate. In addition, electrons are
transferred to NAD+ and FAD, generating NADH and FADH2, respectively.
These coenzymes then transport the electrons to the electron transport
chain, where more ATP is produced via oxidative phosphorylation. To be
clear, the most important function of the citric acid cycle is the
