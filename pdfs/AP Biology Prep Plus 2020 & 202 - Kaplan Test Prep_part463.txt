can be statistically analyzed by
calculating chi-square values.
The chi-square analysis measures the diﬀerence between the number of
observations you make that meet your expectations and the number that

don’t. You put these values into a formula and compare the answer with a
table of standards. The formula is:
As an example, look at the frequencies observed if you toss a coin 100
times. Suppose that you observe that the coin comes up heads 52 times
and comes up tails 48 times. Because there is an equal likelihood that the
coin will come up heads or tails, the expected values for heads and tails
are 50 and 50. Putting these values into the formula:
Compare the value 0.16 to a chi-square table at one degree of freedom
(d.f.). One degree of freedom is used because two observations were
made and d.f. equals number of categories of observations minus one.
