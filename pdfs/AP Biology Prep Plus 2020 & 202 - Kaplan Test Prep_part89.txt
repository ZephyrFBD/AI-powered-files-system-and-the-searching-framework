her the first self-replicating molecules were
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA). The RNA world
hypothesis theorizes that RNA molecules were the first self-replicators,
serving as both heritable information and as functional enzymes. The
current paradigm of life, in which DNA is the primary source of heritable
information and proteins the primary biological catalysts, only emerged
later, according to this view.
Evidence for origin theories comes from biochemistry, laboratory
experiments, and models of early Earth environments. However, the
strongest evidence can be found in the fossil record. The first prokaryote
fossils have been found in geological deposits thought to be 3.5 billion
years old. The oldest eukaryotic cells are from deposits that are about 2
billion years old, while the oldest fossils of multicellular organisms are
from deposits that are 1.25 billion years old.
Molecular and genetic evidence demonstrates that all life on Earth shares
a common ancestor
