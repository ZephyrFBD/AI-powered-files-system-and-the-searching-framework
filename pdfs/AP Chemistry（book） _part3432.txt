Radiation in the Environment  
and Living Systems
We are continuously bombarded by radiation from both natural and artificial sources. 
We are exposed to infrared, ultraviolet, and visible radiation from the Sun; radio waves 
from radio and television stations; microwaves from microwave ovens; X rays from med-
ical procedures; and radioactivity from natural materials (Table 21.8). Understanding the 
different energies of these various kinds of radiation is necessary in order to understand 
their different effects on matter.
When matter absorbs radiation, the radiation energy can cause atoms in the matter to 
be either excited or ionized. In general, radiation that causes ionization, called ionizing
