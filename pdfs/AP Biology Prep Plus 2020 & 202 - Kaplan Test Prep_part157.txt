plasm. In exocytosis, a vesicle containing material to
be expelled simply merges with the lipid bilayer, and the material is
pushed oﬀ into the extracellular space.
There are three distinct types of endocytosis. In phagocytosis, sometimes
known as “cellular eating,” the membrane invaginates around solid
particles. In pinocytosis, or “cellular drinking,” the membrane surrounds
a mass of liquid. Finally, in receptor-mediated endocytosis, a carrier
protein binds to a specific substance, which then triggers the endocytotic
response.
AP EXPERT NOTE
As you prepare for the exam, be familiar with similarities and
diﬀerences between the diﬀerent types of transport across the
cell membrane. Pay close attention to which ones require energy
and which ones do not.
