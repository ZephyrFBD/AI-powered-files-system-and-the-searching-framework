how a population more like the interdigital than the existing bacteria at those sites.
Question 2
(a) Describe how CO2 is a measure of respiration. Explain why temperature might affect the rate of respiration.
(2 points)
CO2 is a byproduct of cellular respiration, which is why we need to get rid of it when we exhale. Living things, like
crickets, make more CO2 when they are performing more cellular respiration (with the processes glycolysis and the
Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain). CO2 is a byproduct of the Krebs cycle.
Temperature might affect respiration because the crickets change their behavior levels with the temperature. This
makes them use more oxygen and energy and need more respiration when they are more active. Also, certain enzymes
work better at different temperatures, so this might increase the rate of respiration or decrease the rate of
respiration, depending on how the temperature impacts enzyme efficiency.
(b) On a set of axes, construct an appropriately la
