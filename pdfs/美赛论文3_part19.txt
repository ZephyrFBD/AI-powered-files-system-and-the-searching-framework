With the initial conditions, we know the temperature of every single position in the
bathtub with filled water, which means knowing the 3D temperature distribution in
the bathtub. Through the equation above, we can figure out the temperature of any
position in the bathtub filled with water at any moment.
The bathtub is filled with water. Once the hot water from the single faucet strikes
the cold water in the bathtub, the kinetic energy that emerges will force the cold water
to float into the overflow drain.
Adding hot water can be divided into three stages:
(1) At first, it is the initial stage of adding hot water. The speed of draining away
water will increase from zero to a stable number. Duri
