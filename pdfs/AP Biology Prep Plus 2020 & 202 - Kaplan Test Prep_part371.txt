re biological catalysts that speed up reactions. A
substrate binds to an enzyme at its active site (where the chemical
reaction occurs) and forms an enzyme-substrate complex. Aȇer
products are formed, the enzyme returns to its original state. The
graphs below show the energy of reactions with and without an
enzyme, where Ea is the activation energy and ∆G is the change in
free energy between substrate and product.
Based on the graphs, which of the following accurately describes
how enzymes aﬀect the energy of a reaction?
Enzymes do not change the net energy released in the
reaction.
(A)
Enzymes speed up reactions by increasing the activation
energy.
(B)
The energy input required to reach the transition state
without an enzyme increases the free energy change of the
reaction.
(C)
The enzyme-substrate complex facilitates the formation of
the transition state to lower the free energy change of the
reaction.
(D)
