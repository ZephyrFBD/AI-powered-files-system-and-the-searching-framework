(ii), which are the conservation laws for momentum and kinetic energy, are
both satisfied by the solution  
and  
This is a valid solution, but not very interesting.
It corresponds to no collision at all—when the two objects miss each other.
vB
œ = vB.
vA
œ = vA
But if we compare the total kinetic energy just before the collision with the 
total kinetic energy just after the collision, and they are found to be the same,
then we say that the total kinetic energy is conserved. Such a collision is called 
an elastic collision. If we use the subscripts A and B to represent the two objects,
we can write the equation for conservation of total kinetic energy as
[elastic collision] (7;6)
Primed quantities 
mean after the collision, and unprimed mean before the
collision, just as in Eq. 7–3 for conservation of momentum.
At the atomic level the collisions of atoms and molecules are often elastic.
But in the “macroscopic” world of ordinary objects, an elastic collision is an ideal
that is never q
