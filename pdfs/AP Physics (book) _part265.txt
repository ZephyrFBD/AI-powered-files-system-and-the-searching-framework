ile motion of a small
ball projected horizontally with initial 
velocity  
The dashed black line 
represents the path of the object. The 
velocity vector is in the direction of 
motion at each point, and thus is tangent to 
the path. The velocity vectors are green 
arrows, and velocity components are dashed.
(A vertically falling object starting from rest 
at the same place and time is shown at the 
left for comparison;
is the same at each
instant for the falling object and the 
projectile.)

In the horizontal direction, on the other hand, there is no acceleration (we are
ignoring air resistance). With
the horizontal component of velocity,
remains constant, equal to its initial value,
and thus has the same magnitude
at each point on the path. The horizontal displacement (with
) is given by
The two vector components,
and 
can be added
vectorially at any instant to obtain the velocity 
at that time (that is, for each
point on the path), as shown in Fig. 3â€“18.
