ntaining homeostasis in humans is thermoregulation, or maintaining body
temperature.
i.
The sensors within the brain’s hypothalamus detect changes in body temperature.
ii. Integrators in the brain will trigger a response that will cause shivering muscles, which will
produce heat if the temperature is cold. If the body is hot, then one response will be to stimulate
sweat glands to cool it by evaporative cooling. The sensor and integration center of the
hypothalamus controls this response.
iii. The effectors are either the muscles (when cold) or sweat glands (when hot).
E. Organisms use both negative and positive feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environments,
respond to external stimuli, and regulate growth and reproduction.
1. Negative feedback—occurs when a stimulus produces a result and the result inhibits further
stimulation.
i.
Thermoregulation is an example of negative feedback.
ii. The body gets colder and the response is to warm the body.
iii. Once the body is at th
