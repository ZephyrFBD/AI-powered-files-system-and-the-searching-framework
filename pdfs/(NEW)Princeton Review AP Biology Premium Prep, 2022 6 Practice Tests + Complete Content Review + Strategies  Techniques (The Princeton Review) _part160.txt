Side chain polarity affects whether an amino acid is more hydrophobic or more hydrophilic. You can see all 20
amino acids on the next page. While there are different ways of categorizing amino acids, the AP Exam divides
them into 3 broad categories: hydrophobic (non-polar and uncharged), hydrophilic (polar and uncharged), and
ionic (polar and charged). In addition to the three-letter abbreviations we’ve listed, each amino acid is also given a
one-letter name. For example, histidine can be referred to as His or just H. Don’t worry about memorizing these
abbreviations for the test.
Check out the bottom of the chart on the next page: at physiological pH (which is about 7.4), two of the amino acids
(glutamic acid and aspartic acid) donate a proton, making them negatively charged. In contrast, lysine and arginine
accept protons at physiological pH, so they are usually positively charged.
Finally, not
