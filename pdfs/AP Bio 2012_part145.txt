 option is incorrect. The bacteria in Plate I were not exposed to the plasmid.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Plate III does not distinguish which bacteria took up the 
plasmid. Bacteria with and without the plasmid grow, but the percentage of those 
with the ability to produce insulin is much lower than in Plate IV
.
(C)
This option is correct. In Plate IV the colonies of E. coli were successfully 
transformed and expressed the ampr gene; adding another gene to the plasmid 
would express the human insulin gene the same way. 
(D)
This option is incorrect. The bacteria on Plate I were not exposed to the plasmid 
and so could not have taken up the insulin gene, thus eliminating this choice.
