71. A fish finder uses a sonar device that sends 20,000-Hz
sound pulses downward from the bottom of the boat, and
then detects echoes. If the maximum depth for which it is
designed to work is 85 m, what is the minimum time between
pulses (in fresh water)?
72. A single mosquito 5.0 m from a person makes a sound
close to the threshold of human hearing (0 dB). What will
be the sound level of 200 such mosquitoes?
73. What is the resultant sound level when an 81-dB sound and
an 87-dB sound are heard simultaneously?
74. The sound level 8.25 m from a loudspeaker, placed in the
open, is 115 dB. What is the acoustic power output (W) of
the speaker, assuming it radiates equally in all directions?
75. A stereo amplifier is rated at 225 W output at 1000 Hz.
The power output drops by 12 dB at 15 kHz. What is the
power output in watts at 15 kHz?
76. Workers around jet aircraft typically wear protective devices
over their ears. Assume that the sound level of a jet a
