he composition of a mixture can vary. A 
cup of sweetened coffee, for example, can contain either a little sugar or a lot. The sub-
stances making up a mixture are called components of the mixture.
Some mixtures do not have the same composition, properties, and appearance 
throughout. Rocks and wood, for example, vary in texture and appearance in any typ-
ical sample. Such mixtures are heterogeneous [Figure 1.8(a)]. Mixtures that are uniform 
throughout are homogeneous. Air is a homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, 
and smaller amounts of other gases. The nitrogen in air has all the properties of 
pure nitrogen because both the pure substance and the mixture contain the same 
nitrogen molecules. Salt, sugar, and many other substances dissolve in water to 
form homogeneous mixtures [Figure 1.8(b)]. Homogeneous mixtures are also called 
 
solutions. Although the term solution conjures an image of a liquid, solutions can be 
 
solids, liquids, or gases.
