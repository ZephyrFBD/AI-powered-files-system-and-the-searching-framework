A student is attempting to reorganize some preserved
animals in the biology lab that have lost their labels. The
student notices there are some notes on each jar, providing
information on each animal’s classification. The student
labels the unknown animals A-F and enters each animal’s
circulatory system characteristics in a table. If the student
wished to create a phylogeny of organisms A through F, in
what order would the organisms most likely appear on the
tree, from left to right, and why?
a.
The order would be F, E, C, A, B, D as the
general trend in circulatory system evolution is
toward increasingly closed systems.
b.
The order would be B, D, A, C,
