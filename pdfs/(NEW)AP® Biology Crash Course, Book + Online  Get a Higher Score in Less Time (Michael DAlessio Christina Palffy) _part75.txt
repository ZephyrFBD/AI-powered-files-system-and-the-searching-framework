for determining genetic cross
outcomes.
F. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, determine the sex of mammals and many insects. Genes on the X and Y
chromosomes have special patterns of inheritance called X-linkage and Y-linkage.
G. Genes on the same chromosome do not assort independently if they are linked; linkage can be used to
map the relative locations of genes on a chromosome.
H. Pedigree analysis is used to study the inheritance of human genes.

Chromosomal Structure
A. Structure and Function of Eukaryotic Chromosomes
Part
Structure
Function
Genes
Made up of the nucleic acid DNA
Will be transcribed onto mRNA
Will be translated for proteins
Chromatids
Two replicated chromosomes that are held
together at the centromere
Allows proper segregation of chromosome
during meiosis and mitosis
Centromere
DNA region found near the middle (not
always) chromosome
Hold chromatids together to form a chromosome
Chromatin
DNA and protein combination
Aids in packaging DNA, DNA replication, and
expressi
