(A) All the other choices promote outbreeding, the introduction of
new genes into a population.
(B) First, you must determine the pattern of inheritance for this type
of deafness. You can eliminate dominant, recessive, or sex-linked
because none of the affected children in the third generation had a
parent with the condition. It also cannot be inherited as a sex-linked

recessive trait because in order for female #1 to have the condition,
her father would have had to have it. He does not. Therefore, the
trait must be inherited as an autosomal recessive. That being the
case, the affected male is homozygous dd, where d is the trait for
deafness. He has a child with a carrier female (Dd). See the cross
below. There is a 50% chance that any child will have the condition.
It is the same probability for daughters because the trait is not sex-
linked.
