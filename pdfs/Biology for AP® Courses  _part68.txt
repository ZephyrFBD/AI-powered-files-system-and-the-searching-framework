the natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural
sciences into life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving
matter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build
on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Natural sciences are sometimes referred to as “hard science”
because they rely on the use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to
use qualitative assessments to drive investigations and findings.
Not surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell structure
and function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism. Those biol
