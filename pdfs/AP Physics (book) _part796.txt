much simpler if
we use the radian for angular measure. One radian (abbreviated rad) is defined
as the angle subtended by an arc whose length is equal to the radius. For
example, in Fig. 8–1b, point P is a distance r from the axis of rotation, and it has
moved a distance along the arc of a circle. The arc length is said to “subtend”
the angle 
In radians, any angle is given by
[ in radians] (8;1a)
where r is the radius of the circle, and is the arc length subtended by the angle 
specified in radians. If 
then 
The radian is dimensionless since it is the ratio of two lengths. Nonetheless
when giving an angle in radians, we always mention rad to remind us it is not
degrees. It is often useful to rewrite Eq. 8–1a in terms of arc length 
(8;1b)
Radians can be related to degrees in the following way. In a complete circle there
are 360°, which must correspond to an arc length equal to the circumference of the
circle,
For a full circle,
. Thus
One radian is then
