5. Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries Auxiliary substances (for example, solvents, sep-
aration agents, etc.) should be used as little as possible. Those that are used should 
be as nontoxic as possible.
6. Design for Energy Efficiency Energy requirements of chemical processes should 
be recognized for their environmental and economic impacts and should be min-
imized. If possible, chemical reactions should be conducted at room temperature 
and pressure.
7. Use of Renewable Feedstocks A raw material or feedstock should be renewable
