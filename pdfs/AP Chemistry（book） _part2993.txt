and it breaks on impact (Figure 19.1). Now, imagine seeing a video clip in 
which a broken egg rises from the floor, reassembles itself, and ends up in someoneâ€™s 
hand. You would conclude that the video is running in reverse because you know 
that broken eggs do not rise and reassemble themselves. An egg falling and break-
ing is a spontaneous process, whereas the egg rising and reassembling itself is a non-
spontaneous process.
Processes that are spontaneous in one direction are nonspontaneous in the  
opposite direction.
Experimental conditions, such as temperature and pressure, are often important 
in determining whether a process is spontaneous. Consider, for example, the melt-
ing of ice. Ice melts spontaneously at atmospheric pressure when the temperature 
of the surroundings is above 0 oC. When the surroundings are below 0 oC, however, 
liquid water freezes spontaneously. The reverse process, melting, is then nonsponta-
neous as summarized in Figure 19.2.
