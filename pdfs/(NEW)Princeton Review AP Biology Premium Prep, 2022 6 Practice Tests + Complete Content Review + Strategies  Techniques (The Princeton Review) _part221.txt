various molecules. Here is a quick review on the function of enzymes.
Enzymes Do:
increase the rate of a reaction by lowering the reaction’s activation energy
form temporary enzyme-substrate complexes
remain unaffected by the reaction
Enzymes Don’t:
change the reaction
make reactions occur that would otherwise not occur at all
Induced-fit
However, scientists have discovered that enzymes and substrates don’t fit together quite so seamlessly. It appears
that the enzyme has to change its shape slightly to accommodate the shape of the substrates. This is called induced-
fit. Sometimes certain factors are involved in activating the enzyme and making it capable of binding the substrate.
Because the fit between the enzyme and the substrate must be perfect, enzymes operate only under a strict set of
biological conditions.
Enzymes Don’t Always Work Alone
Enzymes sometimes need a little help in catalyzing a reaction. Those factors are known as cofactors. Cofactors can
be either organic molecules
