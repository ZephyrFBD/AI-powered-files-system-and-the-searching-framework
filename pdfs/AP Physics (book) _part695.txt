ts on a system, the total momentum of the system is a conserved quantity.
This was expressed in Eq. 7–2 for a single object, but it holds also for a system as
we shall see.
Consider the head-on collision of two billiard balls, as shown in Fig. 7–3.
We assume the net external force on this system of two balls is zero—that is,
the only significant forces during the collision are the forces that each ball 
exerts on the other. Although the momentum of each of the two balls changes 
as a result of the collision, the sum of their momenta is found to be the same
before as after the collision. If 
is the momentum of ball A and 
the momentum of ball B, both measured just before the collision, then the 
total momentum of the two balls before the collision is the vector sum
Immediately after the collision, the balls each have a different
velocity and momentum, which we designate by a “prime” on the velocity:
and 
The total momentum after the collision is the vector sum
No matter what the velocit
