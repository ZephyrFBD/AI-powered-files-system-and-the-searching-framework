which curve corresponds to He? (b) If A and B refer to the 
same gas at two different temperatures, which represents the 
higher temperature? (c) For each curve, which speed is high-
est: the most probable speed, the root-mean-square speed, or 
the average speed? [Section 10.7]

 10.10  Consider the following samples of gases:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
5 He
5 N2
 
 If the three samples are all at the same temperature, rank 
them with respect to (a) total pressure, (b) partial pressure 
of helium, (c) density, (d) average kinetic energy of particles.

 10.11  A thin glass tube 1 m long is filled with Ar gas at 1 atm, and 
the ends are stoppered with cotton plugs as shown below. 
HCl gas is introduced at one end of the tube, and simultane-
ously NH3 gas is introduced at the other end. When the two 
gases diffuse through the cotton plugs down the tube and 
meet, a white ring appears due to t
