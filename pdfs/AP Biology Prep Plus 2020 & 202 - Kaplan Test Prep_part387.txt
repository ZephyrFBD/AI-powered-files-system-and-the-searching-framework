reas an endergonic
reaction occurs when the change is greater than zero. The
diagram below shows the relationship of free energy between
photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Based on the diagram,
which of the following correctly explains the relationship?
Photosynthesis is exergonic, producing ATP and CO2; cellular
respiration is endergonic, consuming glucose and H2O.
(A)
Photosynthesis is exergonic, absorbing light energy to make
ATP; cellular respiration is endergonic, releasing heat and
CO2.
(B)
Cellular respiration is exergonic, consuming ATP to make
glucose; photosynthesis is endergonic, absorbing light
energy and releasing heat.
(C)
Cellular respiration is exergonic, making ATP and releasing
heat; photosynthesis is endergonic, converting light energy
to chemical energy and glucose.
(D)
6. Dichlorophenolindophenol (DPIP), an electron acceptor that
changes from blue to clear when reduced, can be used to visually
determine the rate of photosynthesis. In an experiment, a solution
