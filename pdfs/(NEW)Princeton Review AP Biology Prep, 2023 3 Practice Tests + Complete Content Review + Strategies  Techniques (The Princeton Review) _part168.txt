t like oil and vinegar, fatty acids and
water don’t mix. The reason for this is that fatty acid tails are nonpolar, and nonpolar substances don’t mix well with
polar ones, such as water.
On the other hand, the phosphate “head” of the lipid is hydrophilic (“water-loving”), meaning that it does mix well
with water. Why? It carries a negative charge, and this charge draws it to the positively charged end of a water
molecule. Since a phospholipid has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region, it is an amphipathic
molecule. One side of a phospholipid loves to hang out with water, and the other side hates to.
Thus, the two fatty acid chains orient themselves away from water, while the phosphate portion orients itself toward
the water. Keep these properties in mind. We’ll see later how this orientation of phospholipids in water relates to the
structure and function of cell membranes.
Cholesterol
Cholesterol is another important type of lipid. Cholesterol is a four-ringed molecule tha
