reaction have ∆G = 0?  
(b) If T is increased from that in part (a), will the reaction 
be spontaneous or nonspontaneous?
 19.68  Reactions in which a substance decomposes by losing CO 
are called decarbonylation reactions. The decarbonylation of 
acetic acid proceeds according to:
CH3COOH1l2 ¡ CH3OH1g2 + CO1g2
By using data from Appendix C, calculate the minimum 
temperature at which this process will be spontaneous un-
der standard conditions. Assume that ∆H° and ∆S° do not 
vary with temperature.
 19.69  Consider the following reaction between oxides of 
nitrogen:
NO21g2 + N2O1g2 ¡ 3 NO1g2
(a) Use data in Appendix C to predict how ∆G for the reac-
tion varies with increasing temperature. (b) Calculate ∆G 
at 800 K, assuming that ∆H° and ∆S° do not change with 
temperature. Under standard conditions is the reaction 
spontaneous at 800 K? (c) Calculate ∆G at 1000 K. Is the 
reaction spontaneous under standard conditions at this 
temperature?
