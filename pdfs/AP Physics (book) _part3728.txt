axies very near us seem to be moving randomly relative to us: some move
towards us (blueshifted), others away from us (redshifted); their speeds are on
the order of 0.001c. But for more distant galaxies, the velocity of recession is much
greater than the velocity of local random motion, and so is dominant and Hubble’s
law (Eq. 33–4) holds very well. More distant galaxies have higher recession
velocity and a larger redshift, and we call their redshift a cosmological redshift.
We interpret this redshift today as due to the expansion of space itself. We can
think of the originally emitted wavelength 
as being stretched out (becoming
longer) along with the expanding space around it, as suggested in Fig. 33–21.
Although Hubble thought of the redshift as a Doppler shift, now we prefer to
understand it in this sense of expanding space. (But note that atoms in galaxies
do not expand as space expands; they keep their regular size.)
There is a third way to produce a redshift, which we mention fo
