Distinguish two different

FIGURE 21–5 A current can be
induced by changing the coil’s area,
even though B doesn’t change. Here
the area A is reduced by pulling on the
sides of the coil: the flux through the
coil is reduced as we go from (a) to (b).
The brief induced current acts in the
direction shown so as to try to maintain
the original flux 
by
producing its own magnetic field into
the page. That is, as area A decreases,
the current acts to increase B in the
original (inward) direction.

(a) Maximum flux

FIGURE 21–6 A current can be induced 
by rotating a coil in a magnetic field. The 
flux through the coil changes from (a) to (b) 
because (in Eq. 21–1,
) 
went from 
to 90° (cos u = 0).
0° (cos u = 1)
£ = BA cos u

so an emf can be induced in three ways:
