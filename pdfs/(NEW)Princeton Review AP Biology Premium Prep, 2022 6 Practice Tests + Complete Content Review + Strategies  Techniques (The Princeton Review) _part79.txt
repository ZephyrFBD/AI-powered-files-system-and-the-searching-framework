(c) Identify which temperature led to having the highest respiration rate in the crickets. (1 point)
The highest respiration rate was found at 35°C, as that showed the greatest increase over time.
(d) Predict what would happen to the CO2 levels in the crickets with an additional 5°C increase above the highest
temperature. Justify your prediction with evidence from the data. (2 points)
With a 5°C increase in temperature, the respiration rate would increase to approximately 2100–2200ppm. This is
justified because the rate increased by approximately 500ppm when the temperature increased by 15°C. This means
that a 5°C increase in temp would increase the respiration rate by about 166ppm.
Question 3
(a) Explain how changing a single nucleotide can change the sequence of the protein.
Changing a nucleotide will change the codon, which is the group of three nucleotides that gets read by the ribosome
when the protein is made. If the codon changes, it might change the amino acid that g
