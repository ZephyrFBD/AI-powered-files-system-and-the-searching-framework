g a clean loading device for each sample, load the remaining samples into their 
wells. 
Electrophoresis 
Step 1 Close the top of the electrophoresis chamber and then connect the electrical leads 
to an appropriate power supply, positive (+) electrode to positive (+) electrode (red to 
red) and negative (-) electrode to negative (-) electrode (black to black). Make sure both 
electrodes are connected to the same channel of the power supply, just as you would 
connect leads to jump-start a car battery — black to black and red to red. 
CAUTION: Be sure to keep the power OFF until you connect all leads! 
Step 2 Turn on the power supply and set the voltage as directed by your teacher. (It is 
recommended that you “run the gel” at 50 volts for approximately 2 hours. If you run the 
gel at a higher voltage for less time, the fragments migrate too quickly through the gel 
with less separation. Again, ask your teacher for assistance if needed.) 
Step 3 Shortly after the current is applied, you
