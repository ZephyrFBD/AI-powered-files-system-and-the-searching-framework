A) is incorrect because the sample size is too
small and because including an actual wall can introduce complicating
variables that make it harder to gauge the impact of phototropism
alone. (C) is incorrect because the sample size is way too small and
because the variation in lighting direction does not match the
conditions of plants growing against a wall. (D) is incorrect because
variation in the wavelengths of light used adds a complicating variable
and does not mimic the conditions of plants growing against a wall.

In order to support the hypothesis that T. melanosporum obtains its
carbon from its host, rather than from the surrounding soil,
experimental results should indicate that the radioactive carbon
(which is taken up by the tree in photosynthesis) is found both in the
tree itself and in the fungus. In addition, there should be very little of
the 13C in the surrounding soil, because otherwise the fungus might be
obtaining the radioactive carbon fr
