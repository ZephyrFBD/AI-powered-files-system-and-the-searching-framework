ws:
i = 1 (because sucrose is a covalent compound and does not form ions)
(d) The turnip in the 0.5 molar pickling solution would probably have a negative percent change in mass
because the line of best fit is below 0% change in mass for a molarity of 0.5.

(a) A plant needs to open its stomata to take in the carbon dioxide it needs for photosynthesis. However, each
time a plant opens its stomata, it can lose water to the atmosphere. The plant needs to balance its needs for
carbon dioxide and water, and this is called the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise.
(b)
(c) There is a statistically significant difference between plant species A and the other two plant species
because the 95% confidence interval for species A does not overlap with the 95% confidence interval for
either species B or species C. However, the 95% confidence intervals for species B and species C do
overlap, so we cannot say there is a statistically significant difference between species B and species C.
