Determine the shock wave angle it produces (a) in the air
just before entering the ocean, and (b) in the water just
after entering. Assume
*69. (III) You look directly overhead and see a plane exactly
1.45 km above the ground flying faster than the speed of
sound. By the time you hear the sonic boom, the plane has
traveled a horizontal distance of 2.0 km. See Fig. 12–38.
Determine (a) the angle of the shock cone,
and (b) the
speed of the plane and its Mach number. Assume the speed
of sound is 330 ms.
