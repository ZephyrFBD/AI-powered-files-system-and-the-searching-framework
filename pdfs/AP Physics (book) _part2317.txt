. 21–11b). There must thus be an induced emf. If the rod is in
contact with the 
conductor (Fig.21–11a), the electrons will flow into the 
There will then be a clockwise (conventional) current in the loop. To calculate the 
emf, we determine the work W needed to move a charge q from one end of the rod
to the other against this potential difference:
The emf equals the work done per unit charge, so
the same result as from Faraday’s law above, Eq. 21–3.
