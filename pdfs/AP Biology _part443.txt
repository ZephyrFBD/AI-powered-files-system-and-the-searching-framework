nize a new area, it is most likely not genetically
representative of the original larger population. Rare alleles may be
overrepresented. This is known as the founder effect and occurred
in the Old Order Amish of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. All of the
colonists descended from a small group of settlers who came to the
United States from Germany in the 1770s. Apparently one or more

of the settlers carried the rare but dominant gene for polydactyly,
having extra fingers and toes. Due to the extreme isolation and
intermarriage of the close community, this population now has a
high incidence of polydactyly.
Notice that whether a trait is dominant or recessive merely determines if
it is expressed or remains hidden. It does not determine how common the
trait is in a population. The increase or decrease in allelic frequency of a
trait results from genetic drift or from the trait being advantageous or
disadvantageous.
