6. Four bags made from dialysis tubing were filled with a sucrose solution. Each bag was then immersed in four
beakers containing sucrose solutions of 0.2M, 0.4M, 0.6M, and 0.8M. After 30 minutes, each bag was weighed and
its change in weight was calculated. All solutions were at 25°C. The results are shown in the following graph:
Determine the solute potential of the dialysis bag to the nearest tenth.
