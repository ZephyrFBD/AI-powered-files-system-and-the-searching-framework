Objective
2.1 The student is able to explain how biological systems use free energy based on empirical
data that all organisms require constant energy input to maintain organization, to grow, and
to reproduce.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:
[APLO 2.1][APLO 2.2][APLO 2.4][APLO 4.16][APLO 2.3]
Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its
environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system
is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and
the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open
