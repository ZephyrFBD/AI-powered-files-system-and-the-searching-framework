As was previously stated, under aerobic conditions cellular respiration can yield 36-38 ATP molecules. If oxygen is not
present, ATP is only produced by substrate-level phosphorylation. Without oxygen, organisms must use another electron
acceptor. Most organisms will use some form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of NAD+ to ensure the
continuation of glycolysis. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate from glycolysis is converted to ethyl alcohol; during lactic
acid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to form lactate as an end-product. Without fermentation and anaerobic respiration,
we wouldn’t have yogurt or soy sauce. Nor would our muscle cells cramp from the buildup of lactate when we exercise
vigorously and oxygen is scarce.
