A leg’s CM. Determine the position of the CM of a whole leg
(a) when stretched out, and (b) when bent at 90°. See Fig. 7–26. Assume the
person is 1.70 m tall.
APPROACH Our system consists of three objects: upper leg, lower leg, and foot.
The location of the CM of each object, as well as the mass of each, is given in
Table 7–1, where they are expressed in percentage units. To express the results
in meters, these percentage values need to be multiplied by 
When the leg is stretched out, the problem is one dimensional and we can 
solve for the x coordinate of the CM. When the leg is bent, the problem is two
dimensional and we need to find both the x and y coordinates.
SOLUTION (a) We determine the distances from the hip joint using Table 7–1
and obtain the numbers (%) shown in Fig. 7–26a. Using Eq. 7–9a, we obtain
(u
upper leg, etc.)
Thus, the center of mass of the leg and foot is 20.4 units from the hip joint, or
from the base of the foot. Since the person is 1.70
