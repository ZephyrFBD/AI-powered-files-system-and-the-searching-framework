Example 2 
An infectious disease begins to spread in a small city of population 10,000. After t days, 
the number of people who have succumbed to the virus is modeled by the function

We know that as m becomes large, the quantity (1+1/m)m approaches to e. 
Thus, the amount approaches A = Pert. 
Continuously compounded interest is calculated by the formula

where A(t) = amount after t years 
            P = principal 
            r  = interest rate per year
