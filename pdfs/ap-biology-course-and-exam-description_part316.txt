) The gametes would get larger from one generation to the next.
(B) The chromosome number would double with each generation.
(C)	
(D) The chromosome number would triple with each generation.
3. Mutations in the MYO6 and POU4F3 genes have been associated with a form 
of hereditary hearing loss in humans. Researchers studying the genes have 
proposed that POU4F3 encodes a transcription factor that influences the 
regulation of MYO6.
Which of the following questions will best help guide the researchers toward a 
direct test of their proposal?
(A) Have mutations in other genes also been associated with hearing loss?
(B) In what types of cells are the mutant forms of the POU4F3 gene expressed?
(C) Are mutations in the MYO6 and POU4F3 genes also found in mice?
(D)	
POU4F3 gene affect MYO6 mRNA levels in cells?
