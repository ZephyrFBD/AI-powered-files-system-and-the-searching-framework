sulfur dioxide, a major air pollutant:
 
S1s2 + O21g2 ¡ SO21g2

Below sulfur in group 6A is selenium, Se. This relatively rare element is essential for 
life in trace quantities, although it is toxic at high doses. There are many allotropes of Se, 
including several eight-membered ring structures that resemble the S8 ring.
The next element in the group is tellurium, Te. Its elemental structure is even more 
complex than that of Se, consisting of long, twisted chains of Te—Te bonds. Both Se and 
Te favor the -2 oxidation state, as do O and S.
From O to S to Se to Te, the elements form larger and larger molecules and become 
increasingly metallic. The thermal stability of group 6A compounds with hydrogen 
decreases down the column: H2O 7 H2S 7 H2Se 7 H2Te, with H2O, water, being the 
most stable of the series.
Group 7A: The Halogens
Some of the properties of the group 7A elements, the halogens, are given in Table 7.7.
