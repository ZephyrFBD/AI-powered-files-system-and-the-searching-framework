nd omega-6 fatty acids, where 
omega refers to the last carbon in the chain (the carboxylic acid carbon is considered the 
first, or alpha, one).
Phospholipids
Phospholipids are similar in chemical structure to fats but have only two fatty acids 
attached to a glycerol. The third alcohol group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate 
group (Figure 24.24). The phosphate group can also be attached to a small charged 
or polar group, such as choline, as shown in the figure. The diversity in phospho-
lipids is based on differences in their fatty acids and in the groups attached to the 
phosphate group.
In water, phospholipids cluster together with their charged polar heads facing the 
water and their nonpolar tails facing inward. The phospholipids thus form a bilayer that 
is a key component of cell membranes (Figure 24.24).
