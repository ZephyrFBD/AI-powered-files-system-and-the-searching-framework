The volume of the reaction mixture increases  
as the NaOH solution is added to the HCl 
solution. Thus, at this point in the titration, 
the volume in the titration ﬂask is:
50.0 mL + 49.0 mL = 99.0 mL = 0.0990 L
Thus, the concentration of H+1aq2 in the 
ﬂask is:
3H+4 =

= 1.0 * 10-3 M
The corresponding pH is:
-log11.0 * 10-32 = 3.00
(b) As before, the initial number of moles of 
each reactant is determined from their vol-
umes and concentrations. The reactant pres-
ent in smaller stoichiometric amount (the 
limiting reactant) is consumed completely, 
leaving an excess of hydroxide ion.
