ivity—in this case, time
dilation—can be applied only by observers in an inertial reference frame. The
Earth is such a frame (or nearly so), whereas the spacecraft is not. The spacecraft
accelerates at the start and end of its trip and when it turns around at the far
point of its journey. Part of the time, the astronaut twin may be in an inertial
frame (and is justified in saying the Earth twin’s clocks run slow). But during the
accelerations, the twin on the spacecraft is not in an inertial frame. So she cannot
use special relativity to predict their relative ages when she returns to Earth. The
Earth twin stays in the same inertial frame, and we can thus trust her predictions
based on special relativity. Thus, there is no paradox. The prediction of the Earth
twin that the traveling twin ages less is the correct one.
Global Positioning System (GPS)
Airplanes, cars, boats, and hikers use global positioning system (GPS) receivers
to tell them quite accurately where they are at a given mo
