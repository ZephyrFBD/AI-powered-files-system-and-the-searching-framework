The Structure of the Atom
To understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element,
the atom. An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, one
gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large
number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities.
Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.
An atom is composed of two regions: the nucleus, which
