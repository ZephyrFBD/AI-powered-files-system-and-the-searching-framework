Sample Exercise 5.11 
Calculating an Enthalpy of Reaction from Enthalpies of Formation
(a) Calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 1 mol of benzene, C6H61l2, to CO21g2 and H2O1l2.  
(b) Compare the quantity of heat produced by combustion of 1.00 g propane with that produced by 1.00 g benzene.
SOLUTION
Analyze (a) We are given a reaction [combustion of C6H61l2 to form 
CO21g2 and H2O1l2] and asked to calculate its standard enthalpy 
change, ∆H°. (b) We then need to compare the quantity of heat 
produced by combustion of 1.00 g C6H6 with that produced by 
1.00 g C3H8, whose combustion was treated p
