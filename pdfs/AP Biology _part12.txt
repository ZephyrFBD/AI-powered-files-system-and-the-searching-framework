ts the production of polypeptides at the ribosome by
an elaborate process.
The cell cycle is complex with highly regulated checkpoints.
Most traits derive from gene interactions that are more
complex than what Mendel described.
The expression of genes is controlled by cell signaling,
transcription factors, alternative splicing of pre-RNA, and
environmental factors.
5
Biological systems interact, and these systems possess
complex properties.
Populations, communities, and ecosystems interact and
respond to changes in the environment.
Mathematical operations can be used to quantify interactions
among living things in the environment.
Interactions between living organisms and their environments
result in the recycling of matter and the movement of energy
through food chains.
