ndom mating, and environmental variance affect allele frequencies in a
population?
Connection for AP® Courses
Take a look at your classmates. Individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of
a particular gene. These differences are called polymorphisms. The distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known
as population variation, is influenced by several factors, including the population’s genetic structure and the environment
(Figure 19.3). Understanding the sources of phenotypic variation is important for determining how a population will evolve
in response to different evolutionary pressures. Only those variations that are encoded in an individual’s genes can be passed
to its offspring and be a target of natural selection.
