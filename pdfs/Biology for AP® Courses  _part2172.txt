selecting for rare
phenotypes, whereas positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common
phenotypes.
Sexual Selection
Males and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs.
Males are often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacock’s tail, while
females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration. Such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms (Figure 19.11),
which arise from the fact that in many populations, particularly animal populations, there is more variance in the
reproductive success of the males than there is of the females. That is, some males—often the bigger, stronger, or more
decorated males—get the vast majority of the total matings, while others receive none. This can occur because the males
are better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with the bigger or more decorated males. In
