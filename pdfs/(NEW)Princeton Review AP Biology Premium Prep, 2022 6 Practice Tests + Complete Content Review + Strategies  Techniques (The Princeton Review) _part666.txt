Questions 3–5 refer to the following passage.
In a species of peas, green (G) peas are known to be classically dominant over yellow (g) peas. A true breeding
green plant and a true breeding yellow plant are crossed. The resulting F1 generation is evaluated, and its phenotype
distribution is shown in Table 1. Two green pea producing members of the F1 generation are then crossed, and the
resulting F2 generation phenotype distribution is shown in Table 2.
