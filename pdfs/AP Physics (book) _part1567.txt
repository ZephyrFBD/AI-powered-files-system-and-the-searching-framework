truction of sensitive plants due to freezing
can be reduced by watering them in the evening. Explain.
5. The specific heat of water is quite large. Explain why this
fact makes water particularly good for heating systems
(that is, hot-water radiators).
6. Why does water in a metal canteen stay cooler if the cloth
jacket surrounding the canteen is kept moist?
7. Explain why burns caused by steam at 100°C on the skin
are often more severe than burns caused by water at 100°C.

Astronomy—size 
of a star
Star radius. The giant star Betelgeuse emits
radiant energy at a rate 
times greater than our Sun, whereas its surface temper-
ature is only half (2900 K) that of our Sun. Estimate the radius of Betelgeuse,
assuming
The Sun’s radius is
APPROACH We assume both stars are spherical, with surface area 
SOLUTION We solve Eq. 14–6 for A:
Then
Hence 
If Betelgeuse
were our Sun, it would envelop us (Earth is 
from the Sun).
