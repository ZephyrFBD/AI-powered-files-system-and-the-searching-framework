Reproduction
Reproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission. Recall that the DNA of a prokaryote exists
as a single, circular chromosome. Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis. Rather the chromosome is replicated and the two
resulting copies separate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. The prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at
its equator and the two resulting cells, which are clones, separate. Binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic
recombination or genetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms.

In transformation, the prokaryote takes in DNA found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes. If a
nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new DNA into its own
chromosome, it
