With the help of the lysosome, the cell continually renews itself by
breaking down and recycling cell parts, a process called autophagy.
Programmed destruction of cells (apoptosis) by their own hydrolytic
enzymes is a critical part of the development of multicelled organisms.
Lysosomes are not generally found in plant cells.
Mitochondria
The mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration. All cells have many
mitochondria; a very active cell could have 2,500 of them. Mitochondria
have an outer double membrane and an inner series of membranes called

cristae. Mitochondria also contain their own DNA. Mitochondria
constantly divide and fuse with each other in order to exchange DNA and
compensate for one anotherâ€™s defects. This is necessary for normal
mitochondrial function, including respiration, cell development, and
apoptosis.
The fact that mitochondria contain their own DNA is a major support
for the endosymbiotic theory. This theo
