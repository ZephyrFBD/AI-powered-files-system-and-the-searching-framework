s a measure of substrate
specificity that indicates the strength of preference for a particular
enzyme. Data for both cofactors are shown below.

Based on the data in the table, which of the following statements
is true?
The wild type enzyme works less eﬀiciently with NAD+ than
the mutant enzyme. With this cofactor, it reaches the
maximum velocity at a much higher substrate concentration
than the mutant enzyme and also has higher substrate
specificity.
(A)
The wild type enzyme works more eﬀiciently with NAD+ than
the mutant enzyme. With this cofactor, it reaches the
