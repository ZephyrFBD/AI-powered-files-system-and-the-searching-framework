her, the two
forms represent the phytochrome system (Figure 23.38).
The phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch. It monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of
environmental light. The effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts
the chromoprotein to the inactive Pr form. Additionally, Pfr can slowly revert to Pr in the dark, or break down over time. In
all instances, the physiological response induced by red light is reversed. The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) can directly
activate other molecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses
specific gene expression.
Once the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs. Unfiltered, full sunlight contains much
more red light than far-red light. Because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in
the far-red region, any plant in the sh
