1–13 Refraction
†
When any wave strikes a boundary, some of the energy is reflected and some is
transmitted or absorbed. When a two- or three-dimensional wave traveling in one
medium crosses a boundary into a medium where its speed is different, the trans-
mitted wave may move in a different direction than the incident wave, as shown
in Fig. 11–42. This phenomenon is known as refraction. One example is a water
wave; the velocity decreases in shallow water and the waves refract, as shown in
Fig. 11–43. [When the wave velocity changes gradually, as in Fig. 11–43, without
a sharp boundary, the waves change direction (refract) gradually.]
In Fig. 11–42, the velocity of the wave in medium 2 is less than in medium 1.
In this case, the wave front bends so that it travels more nearly parallel to the
boundary. That is, the angle of refraction,
is less than the angle of incidence,
To see why this is so, and to help us get a quantitative relation between 
and 
let us think of each wave front as
