Competitive Exclusion Principle
Resources are often limited within a habitat and multiple species may compete to obtain them. All species have an
ecological niche in the ecosystem, which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with
other species in the community. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot occupy the same niche
in a habitat. In other words, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources.
An example of this principle is shown in Figure
