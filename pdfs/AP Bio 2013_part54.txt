ulating the rate of change of the 
absorbance for sample 1 
(B) Comparing the observed results for sample 2 
and sample 3 
(C) Repeating the entire experimental procedure 
at night 
(D) Including multiple trials for all the samples 
 
42. Which of the following can be reasonably 
concluded from the experimental results? 
(A) Chloroplasts must be suspended in a buffer 
solution to function properly. 
(B) The optimal temperature for activation of 
electron transfer is 25Â°C. 
(C) DCPIP inhibits biochemical reactions in 
suspended chloroplasts. 
(D) Light from a lamp can substitute for sunlight 
in stimulating chloroplast processes. 
 
43. If an additional sample containing the 
chloroplast/DCPIP solution was placed at a 
distance of 90 cm from the lamp, which of the 
following predictions would be most consistent 
with the experimental results? 
(A) The concentration of DCPIP in the solution 
will increase exponentially. 
(B) The absorbance at 60 minutes will be roughly 
equal to 1.4.
