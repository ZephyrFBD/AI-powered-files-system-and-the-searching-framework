(a) Describe two types of passive transport.
(b) Using the axes provided, construct a graph of this data. Include 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Based on the data, make a claim about which molecule (A or B) uses simple diffusion and which molecule
uses facilitated diffusion. Justify your claim with evidence from the data.
(d) This experiment is repeated with the addition of a molecule that irreversibly binds to transport proteins in
the cell membrane. Make a prediction about what, if any, c
