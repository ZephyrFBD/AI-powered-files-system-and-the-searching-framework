LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-5.A
Explain how the behavioral 
responses of organisms 
affect their overall fitness 
and may contribute to the 
success of the population.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-5.A.1
Individuals can act on information and 
communicate it to others.
IST-5.A.2
Communication occurs through various 
mechanisms—
a. Organisms have a variety of signaling 
behaviors that produce changes in the 
behavior of other organisms and can result 
in differential reproductive success.
b.	Animals use visual, audible, tactile, electrical, 
and chemical signals to indicate dominance, 
find food, establish territory, and ensure 
reproductive success.
IST-5.A.3
Responses to information and communication 
of information are vital to natural selection and 
evolution—
a.	
b.	Cooperative behavior tends to increase the 
fitness of the individual and the survival of 
the population.
