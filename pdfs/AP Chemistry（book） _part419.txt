Unless stated to the contrary, we will always take combustion to mean complete combustion.

atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Similarly, the coefficients in a balanced chem-
ical equation indicate the exact relative quantities of reactants and products. But how do 
we relate the numbers of atoms or molecules to the amounts we measure in the laboratory? 
If you wanted to react hydrogen and oxygen in exactly the right ratio to make H2O, how 
would you make sure the reactants contain a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms?
Although we cannot count individual atoms or molecules, we can indirectly deter-
mine their numbers if we know their masses. So, if we are to calculate amounts of reac-
tants needed to obtain a given amount of product, or otherwise extrapolate quantitative 
information from a chemical equation or formula, we need to know more about the 
masses of atoms and molecules.
