 needed to make 450 mL of 0.10 M H2SO4?
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to dilute a concentrated solution. We are given the 
molarity of a more concentrated solution (3.0 M) and the volume 
and molarity of a more dilute one containing the same solute (450 mL 
of 0.10 M solution). We must calculate the volume of the concen-
trated solution needed to prepare the dilute solution.
Plan We can calculate the number of moles of solute, H2SO4, in 
the dilute solution and then calculate the volume of the concen-
trated solution needed to supply this amount of solute. Alterna-
tively, we can directly apply Equation 4.33. Letâ€™s compare the two 
methods.
Solve 
Calculate the moles of H2SO4 in the  
dilute solution:
Moles H2SO4 in dilute solution = 10.450 L soln2a
0.10 mol H2SO4
1 L soln
b
 = 0.045 mol H2SO4
Calculate the volume of the concentrated 
solution that contains 0.045 mol H2SO4:
Liters conc soln = 10.045 mol H2SO42a
1 L soln
3.0 mol H2SO4
b = 0.015 L soln
If we apply Equation 4.33, we get the sa
