Be sure students 
understand the difference in these two types 
of ratios, as confusion between them is a 
common student error on the exam. 
Additionally, students should expect to 
calculate a chi-square value and explain the 
meaning in context of a given scenario. On 
the exam, students commonly fail to identify 
the null hypothesis rather than an alternate 
hypothesis; thus, they will need multiple and 
varied opportunities to practice this skill. 
Building their skills in experimental design 
throughout the course will help address 
this misconception. Emphasis should be on 
helping students understand when to reject 
or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Students should understand the value and 
application of the chi-square test in additional 
contexts beyond genetics. Students should 
learn the difference between null and 
alternate hypotheses while understanding 
that the chi-square is not always the most 
appropriate statistical test to analyze the 
results of an experiment
