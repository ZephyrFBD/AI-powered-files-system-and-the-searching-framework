Figure 11.6 An animal cell with a diploid number of four (2n = 4) proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form four
haploid daughter cells.
Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis
Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. They share some similarities, but also
exhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes (Figure 11.7). Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results
in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically
identical to the original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells
and two sets in the case of diploid cells. In most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo
mitosis to form new diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists
