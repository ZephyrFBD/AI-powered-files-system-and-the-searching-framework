■SYNOPSES OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
Materials must move through membranes of a cell for the cell to maintain its dynamic 
homeostasis, and this movement is regulated by selectively permeable membranes. The 
simplest form of movement is diffusion, in which solutes move from an area of high 
concentration to an area of low concentration. Like solutes, water also moves down its 
concentration gradient by osmosis. 
In  Investigation 4: Diffusion and Osmosis,  students calculate surface
area-to-volume ratios, and make predictions about which measurement — surface 
or volume — has the greater influence on the rate of diffusion. Next, students create 
artificial cells to model diffusion, followed by observation of osmosis in living cells 
and measurement of water potential in different types of plants. All sections of the 
investigation provide o
