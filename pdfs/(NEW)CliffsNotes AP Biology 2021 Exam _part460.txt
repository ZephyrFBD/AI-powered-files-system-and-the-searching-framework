successional order of taxa is to remember the phrase "Dumb Kings Play Chess On Fine Green Sand," in which each

All living things consist of one or more cells. All cells have a plasma membrane, genetic material in the form of
DNA, and a mechanism, using RNA and ribosomes, for translating the genetic material into proteins and enzymes.
The classification of living things begins with a description of two kinds of cells, as follows:
1. Eukaryotic cells (eukaryotes) have the following characteristics: 
Chromosomes consist of a long, linear DNA molecule packaged with histone proteins.
The chromosomes are enclosed in a nucleus.
Specialized membrane-enclosed bodies serve to isolate metabolic activities. These bodies, or organelles, include
mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endo
