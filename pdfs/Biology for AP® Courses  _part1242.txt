ffspring a potential evolutionary advantage to sexual reproduction?

What are the three different life-cycles among sexual multicellular organisms and their commonalities?
Connection for AP® Courses
Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. The variation introduced into the reproductive cells (gametes or spores)
by meiosis is advantageous for evolution via natural selection. Meiosis and fertilization alternate as the organisms pass
through the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycles. In most animals, the diploid stage dominates, whereas in fungi,
the haploid stage dominates. Identifying the haploid and diploid stages within the life cycles of different organisms is vital
in understanding how organisms reproduce and in determining when mitosis and meiosis occur.
