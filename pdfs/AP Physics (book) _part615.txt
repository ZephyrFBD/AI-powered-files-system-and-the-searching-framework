so  
In part (b) we let 
be the unknown.
SOLUTION (a) We use Eq. 6–13 with 
and
which gives
or
(b) Now 
will be an unknown. We again use conservation of energy,
but now
and
Solving for the unknown 
gives 
That is, the car has a speed of 
when it is 30 vertical meters above the lowest
point, both when descending the left-hand hill and when ascending the right-hand
hill.

Work and Energy
The mathematics of the roller-coaster Example 6–8 is almost the same as in
Example 6–7. But there is an important difference between them. In Example 6–7
the motion is all vertical and could have been solved using force, acceleration,
and the kinematic equations (Eqs.2–11). For the roller coaster, where the motion is
