e phenotype has a survival advantage, the alleles in that phenotype will become
more prevalent in the population.
5. No mutations—Mutations are very rare and random occurrences. A mutation would change the allele
frequencies in the population.
TIP
Remember, if a question asks for an allele frequency, you need to find p or q. If a question asks for a genotype frequency or the number of
individuals, you need to find p2, 2pq, or q2.
Populations that meet all five of these conditions are said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If a population
is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the following equations apply:
where p represents the frequency of the dominant allele (A) and q represents the frequency of the recessive allele (a)
—note that this equation is used to describe allele frequencies—and
where p2 represents the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (AA), 2pq represents the frequency of the
heterozygous genotype (Aa), and q2 represents the frequency of the homozygous recessive g
