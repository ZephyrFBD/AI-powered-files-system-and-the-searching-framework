right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one
direction to prevent the backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the
biscuspid or mitral valve. After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing
the semilunar valve (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries,
the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then
receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or
mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out
through aorta, the major
