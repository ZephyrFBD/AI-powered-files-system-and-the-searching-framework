cetate, EDTA, is 
hexadentate.  This is an unusual, 7-coordinate, complex. (d) eth-
ylenediamine, en, is bidentate. 23.31 (a) Acetonitrile (CH3CN)  
(b) hydride ion (H-) (c) carbon monoxide (CO) 23.33 False. The 
ligand is not typically a bidentate ligand. The entire molecule is pla-
nar and the benzene rings on either side of the two N atoms inhibit 
their approach in the correct orientation for chelation. 23.35  
(a) 3Cr1NH3264 1NO323 (b) 3Co1NH324CO342SO4 (c) 3Pt1en22Cl24Br2 
(d) K3V1H2O22Br44 (e) 3Zn1en2243Hgl44 23.37 (a) tetraamminedi-
chl-ororhodium(III) chloride (b) potassium hexachlorotitanate(IV)

(IV) bromide 23.39(a) Complexes 1, 2 and 3 can have geometric iso-
mers; they each have cis-trans isomers. (b) Complex 2 can have link-
age isomers, owing to the presence of the nitrite ligand. (c) The cis 
geometric isomer of complex 3 can have optical isomers (d) Complex 
1 can have coordination sphere isomers. It is
