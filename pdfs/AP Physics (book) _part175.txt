 reasonably heavy object if the velocity becomes
large.† Acceleration due to gravity is a vector, as is any acceleration, and its
direction is downward toward the center of the Earth.
When dealing with freely falling objects we can make use of Eqs. 2–11,
where for a we use the value of g given above. Also, since the motion is vertical
we will substitute y in place of x, and 
in place of 
We take
unless
otherwise specified. It is arbitrary whether we choose y to be positive in the
upward direction or in the downward direction; but we must be consistent about
it throughout a problem’s solution.
EXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 21, and answer it again
now, assuming minimal air resistance. Try to explain why you may have answered
differently the first time.
Falling from a tower. Suppose that a ball is dropped
from a tower. How far will it have fallen after a time  
and  
Ignore air resistance.
APPROACH Let us take y as positive downward, so the acceleration is
We set
