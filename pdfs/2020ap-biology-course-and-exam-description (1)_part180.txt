The salient features of translation include—
a.	Translation is initiated when the rRNA in the 
ribosome interacts with the mRNA at the start 
codon.
b.	The sequence of nucleotides on the mRNA is 
read in triplets called codons.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
c.	Each codon encodes a specific amino acid, 
which can be deduced by using a genetic 
code chart. Many amino acids are encoded 
by more than one codon.
d.	Nearly all living organisms use the same 
genetic code, which is evidence for the 
common ancestry of all living organisms.
e.	tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the 
correct place specified by the codon on the 
mRNA.
f.	 The amino acid is transferred to th
