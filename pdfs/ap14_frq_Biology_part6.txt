ionships among the different mammals. Indicate on the cladogram where each of the
characters most likely arose in the evolutionary process, and justify the placement of the characters on 
the cladogram. 
(b) Describe FOUR steps in the activation of the mother’s specific immune response following exposure to a 
bacterial pathogen. Predict how the mother’s immune response would differ upon a second exposure  
to the same bacterial pathogen a year later.  
 
 
Plus symbol indicates the presence of the character, and minus symbol indi
cates the absence of the character.
(c) Predict the most likely consequence for a nursing infant who is exposed to an intestinal bacterial pathogen 
(e.g., Salmonella) to which the mother was exposed three months earlier. Justify your prediction.  
 The figure shows a blank horizontal cladogram. From left to right, the ancestral lineage splits into an upper lineage and a lower lineage. The upper lineage diverges into three lineages at a single time point. The
