carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide)
bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (Figure 15.16). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates
one water molecule.
Figure 15.16 A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, expelling one
water molecule. For simplicity in this image, only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond are shown. The R
and R' designations refer to the rest of each amino acid structure.
The Protein Synthesis Machinery
In addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The
composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of
rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis
machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells.
