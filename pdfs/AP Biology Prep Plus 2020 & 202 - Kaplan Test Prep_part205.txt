NA to be replicated for generations alongside the host cell
DNA. The infection continues so that all oﬀspring of the host cell carry the
viral DNA. This DNA can simply remain a part of the host cell’s genome
forever. For example, certain bacteria (e.g., Corynebacterium diphtheriae,
which causes diphtheria, and Clostridium botulinum, which causes
botulism) secrete toxins that are coded for by viral genes that were
acquired from a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria). In some
cases, however, certain environmental events may cause this integrated
viral DNA to begin a full replicative cycle (lytic cycle), accompanied by the
production of new viruses and the eventual death of the cell.
Bacteria
Bacteria are prokaryotes, micrometers in size, that live in diverse
environments. Single-celled organisms composed of an outer cell wall
and inner cell membrane, bacteria contain a free-floating DNA
chromosome (not enclosed in a nucleus). Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria do
not have membrane-boun
