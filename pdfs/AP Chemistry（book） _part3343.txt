 called the solar wind. Bursts of radiation and particles 
continuously erupt from the surface, producing solar flares.

In this chapter, we examine various common kinds of nuclear reactions and the fac-
tors that relate to the stability of the nucleus. We also consider how the rates of nuclear 
reactions are described and used, how radioactivity is detected, and how energy changes 
associated with nuclear reactions can be calculated. Finally, we discuss the effects of radi-
ation on matter, especially living systems.

Radioactivity and Nuclear 
Equations
To understand nuclear reactions, we must review and develop some ideas introduced in 
Section 2.3:
t Two types of subatomic particles reside in the nucleus: protons and neutrons. We will 
refer to these particles as nucleons.
t All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons; this number is the 
element’s atomic number.
t Atoms of a given element can have different numbers of neutrons, which means they 
can
