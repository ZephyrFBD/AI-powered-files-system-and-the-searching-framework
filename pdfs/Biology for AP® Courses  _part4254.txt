These new technologies were powered using fossil
fuels, especially coal. The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the

Current and Past Drivers of Global Climate Change
Since it is not possible to go back in time to directly observe and measure climate, scientists use indirect evidence to
determine the drivers, or factors, that may be responsible for climate change. The indirect evidence includes data collected
using ice cores, boreholes (a narrow shaft bored into the ground), tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean
