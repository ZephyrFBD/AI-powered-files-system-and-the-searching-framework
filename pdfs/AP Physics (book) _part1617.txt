15–3 Human Metabolism and 
the First Law
Human beings and other animals do work. Work is done when a person walks or
runs, or lifts a heavy object. Work requires energy. Energy is also needed for
growth—to make new cells, and to replace old cells that have died. A great many
energy-transforming processes occur within an organism, and they are referred
to as metabolism.
We can apply the first law of thermodynamics,
to an organism: say, the human body. Work W is done by the body in its various
activities; if this is not to result in a decrease in the body’s internal energy (and
temperature), energy must somehow be added to compensate. The body’s inter
