a uniformly charged sphere is the same as if all the charge
were concentrated at its center.]

What is the acceleration experienced
by an electron near the surface of the Earth? (b) What about
a proton? (c) Calculate the ratio of each acceleration to

the air. If the downward-directed electric field of the Earth
is 
how many excess electron charges must the
water droplet have?

group shown in Fig. 16–63. The C and O have charges
and the H and N have charges
