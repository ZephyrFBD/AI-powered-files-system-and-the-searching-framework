ve than hydrogen, making it more likely that
a shared electron would be found near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative
charge near the oxygen.

As a result of water’s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between
water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. A polar
substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic (hydro- = “water”; -philic =
“loving”). In contrast, non-polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as shown in Figure 2.14 and
separate from it rather than dissolve in it, as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar (an acidic water solution).
These nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic (hydro- = “water
