t, such as Ag1NH322
+, is 
called a complex ion. Complex ions are very soluble in water. The stability of a com-
plex ion in aqueous solution can be judged by the size of the equilibrium constant for 
its formation from the hydrated metal ion. For example, the equilibrium constant for 
Equation 17.24 is
 
Kf =
3Ag1NH322
+4
3Ag+43NH342 = 1.7 * 107 
[17.25]
Note that the equilibrium constant for this kind of reaction is called a formation con-
stant, Kf. The formation constants for several complex ions are listed in Table 17.1.
The general rule is that the solubility of metal salts increases in the presence of suit-
able Lewis bases, such as NH3, CN-, or OH-, provided the metal forms a complex with 
the base. The ability of metal ions to form complexes is an extremely important aspect of 
their chemistry.
