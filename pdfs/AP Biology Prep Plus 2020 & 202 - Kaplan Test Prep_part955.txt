on 1 tested positive for all three tests: Benedict’s
(orange), Biuret (purple), and Sudan III (orange). The correct answer is
(A). (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they did not test positive for
all three tests.

Plasmids are less eﬀicient than viruses at delivering genes into host
cells but are less likely to elicit an immune system response. Plasmids
have the capacity to carry larger genes that may be too big to fit into
viruses and can be amplified quickly (millions of copies can be
produced within bacteria in hours). The correct answer is (B). (A) is
incorrect because, although plasmids may provide cells with antibiotic
resistance, they can deliver large amounts of genetic material. (C) is
incorrect because, although plasmids generally do not elicit an
immune response, they are less eﬀicient in transferring DNA to host
cells. (D) is incorrect because, although plasmids can be mass
produced, they are unable to target specific types of cells.
