Asymmetrical organisms can produce equal
halves if cut along a certain plane, whereas
radially and bilaterally symmetric organisms
have no distinct pattern.
b.
Asymmetrical organisms have no distinct
pattern, whereas radially and bilaterally
symmetric organisms can produce equal halves
if cut along a certain plane.
c.
Asymmetrical organisms produce equal halves if
cut along a certain plane with no definite right or
left side, whereas radially and bilaterally
symmetric organisms can produce equal halves.
d.

24. Why are most organisms with exoskeletons relatively
small?
a.
Increases in body weight increase body size by a
factor of eight, and the chitin thickness of the
exoskeleton has to significantly decrease to
accommodate increase in body si
