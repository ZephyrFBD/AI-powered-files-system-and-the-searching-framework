substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions. Examples of this sort of enzyme regulation
based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take place
exclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in the digestion of cellular debris and foreign materials, located
within lysosomes.
Feedback Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways
Molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. A major question remains, however: What are these molecules
and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as youâ€™ve learned. What
other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive
inhibition? The answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles. Some of these molecules include
pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. Perhaps the most relevant source
