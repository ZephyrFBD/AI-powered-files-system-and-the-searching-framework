strate being hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The products released
are water and oxygen gas.
Note: Oxygen gas is flammable and will reignite a glowing flint.
Note: Peroxide is a toxic by-product of aerobic metabolism.
Abiotic and biotic factors should affect the efficiency of this reaction.

Interpretation of this Experiment
The above chart shows how pH affects the enzymatic activity of peroxidase. Its optimal pH
environment, according to the chart, is around pH 5.0, with also decent activity continuing at pH 6.0.
There is almost no activity at pH 7.0 and extremely little activity at pH 8.0 and pH 10.
