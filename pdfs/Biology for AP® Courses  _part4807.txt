higher latitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable. Scientists are planning for the effects of global
warming on future preserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to
habitats; however, the end effectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based.
Finally, an argument can be made that conservation preserves reinforce the cultural perception that humans are separate
from nature, can exist outside of it, and can only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity. Creating preserves reduces
the pressure on human activities outside the preserves to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity. Ultimately, the
political, economic, and human demographic pressures will degrade and reduce the size of conservation preserves if the
activities outside them are not altered to be less damaging to biodiversity.
