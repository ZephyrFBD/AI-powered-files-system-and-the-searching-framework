• Light color (How can 
students explain that 
plants are green and that 
chlorophyll does not 
absorb green light?) 
• Temperature 
• Bicarbonate concentration 
(CO2 source) 
• Direction of incoming 
light 
• pH of solution 
• Leaf color (chlorophyll 
amount) 
• Leaf size 
• Stomata density 
• Stomata distribution 
• Light-starved leaves vs. 
leaves kept in bright light 
• Type of plant 
• Leaf age 
• Leaf variegation 
• Role of respiration 
in plants along with 
photosynthesis — 
measuring gross 
photosynthesis 
• Size of leaf disk 
• Depth of bicarbonate 
solution 
• Methods of cutting disks 
• Leaf disk overlap 
• Soap amount 
• How many times can the 
procedure be repeated 
with the same disks? 
• How long can the disks 
remain sunk in the 
solution — can they be 
stored overnight? 
• Method of collecting data 
Once students learn how to measure the rate of photosynthesis and have discussed a
