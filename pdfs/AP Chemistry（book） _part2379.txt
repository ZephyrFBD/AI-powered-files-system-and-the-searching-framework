Evaluating Kc
We can illustrate how the law of mass action was discovered empirically and demonstrate 
that the equilibrium constant is independent of starting concentrations by examining a 
series of experiments involving dinitrogen tetroxide and nitrogen dioxide:
 
N2O41g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2  Kc =
3NO242
3N2O44

We start with several sealed tubes containing different concentrations of NO2 and N2O4. 
The tubes are kept at 100 °C until equilibrium is reached. We then analyze the mixtures 
and det
