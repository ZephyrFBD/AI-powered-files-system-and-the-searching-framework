 perception
Divided into right and left hemispheres
The left side of the brain receives information from and controls the right side
of the body and vice versa
Cerebellum
Coordinates movement and balance; helps in learning and remembering motor
skills
Receives sensory information about the position of joints and muscles
Monitors motor commands from the cerebrum and integrates the information
as it carries out coordination
Brainstemâ€”includes
medulla oblongata
Controls several automatic homeostatic functions, including breathing, heart
and blood vessel activity, swallowing, and digestion
Receives and integrates several types of sensory information and sends it to
specific regions of the forebrain
Transfers information between the PNS and other parts of the brain
For the AP exam, focus on the basics of cell communication: how cells
