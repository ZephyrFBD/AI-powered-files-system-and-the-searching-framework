hot. If you are using these, advise students not to drip water on them (shatter hazard) 
or to lean against a light (burn hazard). Most but not all syringes are capable of 
withstanding the vacuum created in this procedure without failure. However, you should 
test the syringes beforehand. 
■ ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK 
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to cellular 
processes (big idea 2), specifically, the capture, use, and storage of free energy, or 
interactions (big idea 4). In addition, some questions students are likely to raise connect 
to evolution (big idea 1). As always, it is important to make connections between big 
ideas and enduring understandings, regardless of where in the curriculum the lab is 
taught. The concepts align with the enduring understandings and learning objectives 
from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework, as indicated below.
