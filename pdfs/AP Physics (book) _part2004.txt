ing cells of unusual shape (Fig. 18â€“27). Attached to the main
cell body are several small appendages known as dendrites and a long tail called
the axon. Signals are received by the dendrites and are propagated along the
axon. When a signal reaches the nerve endings, it is transmitted to the next
neuron or to a muscle at a connection called a synapse.

Before 1986 the highest temperature at which a material was found to
superconduct was 23 K, which required liquid helium to keep the material cold.
In 1987, a compound of yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen (YBCO) was
developed that can be superconducting at 90 K. Since this is above the boiling
temperature of liquid nitrogen, 77 K, liquid nitrogen is sufficiently cold to keep
the material superconducting. This was an important breakthrough because
liquid nitrogen is much more easily and cheaply obtained than is the liquid
helium needed for earlier superconductors. Superconductivity at temperatures
as high as 160 K has been reported, tho
