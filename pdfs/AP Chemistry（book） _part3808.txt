EPR model, the molecular geometry about each carbon atom in an alkane 
is tetrahedral. 
 (Section 9.2) The bonding may be described as involving sp3@hybridized 
orbitals on the carbon, as pictured in Figure 24.3 for methane. 
 (Section 9.5)
Rotation about a carbonâ€“carbon single bond is relatively easy and occurs rapidly at 
room temperature. To visualize such rotation, imagine grasping either methyl group of 
the propane molecule in Figure 24.4 and rotating the group relative to the rest of the 
molecule. Because motion of this sort occurs rapidly in alkanes, a long-chain alkane 
molecule is constantly undergoing motions that cause it to change its overall shape.
structural Isomers
The alkanes in Table 24.2 are called straight-chain or linear hydrocarbons because all the 
carbon atoms are joined in a continuous chain. Alkanes consisting of four or more car-
bon atoms can also form branched chains, and when they do, they are called branched-
chain hydrocarbons. (The branches in organic
