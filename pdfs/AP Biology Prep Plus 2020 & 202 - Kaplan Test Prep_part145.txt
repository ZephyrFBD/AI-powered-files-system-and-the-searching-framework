MEMBRANE STRUCTURE
All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane. In eukaryotic cells, the
nucleus and most of the organelles are also surrounded by plasma
membranes. Membranes are composed mostly of lipids, which are full of
nonpolar covalent bonds, so they are hydrophobic and do not dissolve in
water. Because membranes are composed primarily of lipids, most of the
material in membranes will not mix well with water. 
Most of the lipids in membranes have a phosphate group attached to one
end, so they are called phospholipids. The charged end (phosphate
group) is polar and happy to be in water, which is why it is termed
hydrophilic. The other end of the phospholipid is a tail that is nonpolar,
and it turns in toward the
