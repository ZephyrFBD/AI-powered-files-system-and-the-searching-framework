A concept similar to center of mass is center of gravity (CG). An object’s CG is
that point at which the force of gravity can be considered to act. The force of gravity
actually acts on all the different parts or particles of an object, but for purposes of
determining the translational motion of an object as a whole, we can assume that 
the entire weight of the object (which is the sum of the weights of all its parts) acts 
at the CG. There is a conceptual difference between
