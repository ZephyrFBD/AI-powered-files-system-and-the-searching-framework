ganisms, but the mass of the organisms decreased. (D) is
incorrect, since the mass would increase if the organisms could grow. The organisms cannot grow
since there were no nutrients added to the tank.
9. (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect, as the Elodea cannot do photosynthesis in the dark. (B) is incorrect
because the organisms need oxygen from the water to perform photosynthesis. Choice (C) is correct
since the organisms need oxygen to perform cellular respiration and create ATP. (D) is incorrect
because photosynthesis, if it were performed, produces more oxygen. However, it is not performed
since the plants are in the dark.
10. The correct answer is (A). The model shows that glucose is first converted to pyruvate before it can
become acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs Cycle (TCA cycle). It is known that the TCA cycle occurs in
the mitochondrion. (B) is incorrect, as there is also NADH produced during the TCA cycle which can
be used for ATP production, so this would not prohibit the energ
