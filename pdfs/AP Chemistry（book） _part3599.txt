The fluoride ion has four valence-shell electron pairs and can 
act as a Lewis base (an electron-pair donor). Thus, we can en-

THE PERIODIC TABLE AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS (SECTION 22.1)  
The periodic table is useful for organizing and remembering the 
descriptive chemistry of the elements. Among elements of a given 
group, size increases with increasing atomic number, and electro-
negativity and ionization energy decrease. The most nonmetallic 
elements are found in the upper right portion of the periodic table.
Among the nonmetallic elements, the first member of each 
group differs dramatically from the other members; it forms a max-
imum of four bonds to other atoms and exhibits a much greater ten-
dency to form p bonds than the heavier elements in its group.
Because O2 and H2O are abundant in our world, we focus on
