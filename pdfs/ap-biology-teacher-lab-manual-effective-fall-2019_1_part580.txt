deos about DNA 
analysis using restriction enzymes and gel electrophoresis, including one on Carolina 
Biological Supply Company’s website, for homework. Look for the Biotechnology link 
on the “Teacher Resources: Carolina Videos” Web page (http://www.carolina.com), 
or direct students to YouTube for educational videos and/or animations about preparing, 
pouring, loading, and running a gel. 
Allow approximately 20 minutes for students to practice pipetting and gel loading 
(optional) and loading DNA samples in the gels. (See the Potential Challenges section of 
this investigation.) 
It will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to run the gels for the independent 
investigation, depending on the recommended voltage for the particular electrophoresis 
apparatus. For example, if you are using a standard-sized Carolina gel box (which is 
approximately eight inches long), run the gels at 135 volts. Using Bio-Rad gel boxes can 
take up to several hours at 50 volts. If the gels are run at
