ides together along your DNAâ€™s sugar-phosphate backbone (depending on your model kit,
you may have to first disconnect the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases). Which atoms
and molecules did you have to remove and add to create the sugar-phosphate backbone?
Think About It
Explain why radioactive sulfur and phosphorus were used to label T2 bacteriophages in the Hershey-Chase
experiments. How did the results of these experiments contribute to the identification of DNA as the genetic material?
Experiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the
genetic material and not proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria.
Viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic
material, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it
injects
