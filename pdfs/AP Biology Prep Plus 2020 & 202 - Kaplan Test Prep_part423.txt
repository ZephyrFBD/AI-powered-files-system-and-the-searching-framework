At low concentrations, carbon dioxide is a limiting factor of
photosynthesis.
(B)
At high concentrations, carbon dioxide concentration is
directly related to the rate of photosynthesis.

5. According to the Warburg eﬀect, cancer cells have been observed
to undergo aerobic glycolysis. Unlike normal cells, which carry out
aerobic respiration when oxygen is available, cancer cells
metabolize glucose to lactic acid via anaerobic fermentation
despite the presence of oxygen. Cancer cells produce energy at
glycolytic rates up to 200 times higher than those of normal cells.
Which of the following best explains why cancer cells consume
glucose at accelerated rates?
Aerobic glycolysis generates up to 36 ATP per molecule of
glucose.
(A)
Converting glucose to lactate is less eﬀicient than
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
(B)
Lactic acid fermentation consumes more ATP than
mitochondrial oxidative phosph
