 protein activated?
A. The relay molecule binds to Ras.
B. A GDP molecule on Ras is replaced with a GTP molecule. C. Ras is enzymatically split to form two active
proteins.
D. Ras binds to a second relay protein, forming the active form of the protein.
 
5. A signaling cascade is illustrated by protein kinase 1, protein kinase 2, protein kinase 3, and MAP. What purpose
does this cascade serve?
A. The cascade makes the target of the signal more specific. B. The cascade amplifies the signal.
C. The cascade reduces the necessary activation energy for the overall
reaction.
 
D. The cascade generates the necessary energy for activating transcription.
6. The final step shown for this pathway is the transcription of an mRNA (shown at III). What is the most likely
mechanism that initiates this step?
A. The signaling cascade produces RNA polymerases.
B. The signaling cascade generates the ATP required for transcription. C. The mRNA is activated by a product of
the signaling cascade. D. A produc
