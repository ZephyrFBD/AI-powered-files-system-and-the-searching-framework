 heart pacemakers are given power inductively: power
in an external coil is transmitted to a secondary coil in the pacemaker (Fig. 19–25)
inside the person’s body near the heart. Inductive charging is also a possible
means for recharging an electric car’s batteries.
Wireless transmission of power must be done over short distances to maintain
a reasonable efficiency. Wireless transmission of signals (information) can be done
over great distances (Section 22–7) because even fairly low power signals can be
detected, and it is the information in the signal voltages that counts, not power.

Semiconductor; Tape, Hard Drive, RAM
Magnetic Storage: Read/Write on Tape and Disks
Recording and playback on tape or disk is done by magnetic heads. Magnetic
tapes contain a thin layer of ferromagnetic oxide on a thin plastic tape. Computer
hard drives (HD) store digital information (applications and data): they have a
thin layer of ferromagnetic material on the su
