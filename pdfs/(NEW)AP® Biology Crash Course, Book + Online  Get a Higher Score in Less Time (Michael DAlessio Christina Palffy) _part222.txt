Water Loss vs. Time
Interpretation of this Exercise
Transpiration, or the uptake of water from the leaf source, is highest with both light and fan
conditions. Both of these conditions cause water to be lost from the leaf surface. A water potential is
created between the air surrounding the leaf and the photometer where the bottom of the stem contains
water. Water will travel from an area of higher water potential to lower water potential. The mist
condition mimics increased humidity, decreasing the water potential difference, since more water is
occupying the surrounding air. The mist line is actually below that of the control (room) indicating the
surrounding air has more water associated with it.
The line graph above reconfirms the data in the chart: Both the fan and light conditions increase
transpiration over a 30 minute time period, and in fact, show relatively similar transpiration rates.
The transpiration rate in the room is used as a reference point for th
