4. (I) The blades in a blender rotate at a rate of 6500 rpm.
When the motor is turned off during operation, the blades
slow to rest in 4.0 s. What is the angular acceleration as the
blades slow down?
5. (II) The platter of the hard drive of a computer rotates 
at 
per minute
(a) What is the angular velocity 
of the platter? (b) If
the reading head of the drive is located 3.00 cm from the
rotation axis, what is the linear speed of the point on the plat-
ter just below it? (c) If a single bit requires 
of length
along the direction of motion, how many bits per second
can the writing head write when it is 3.00 cm from the axis?
6. (II) A child rolls a ball on a level floor 3.5 m to another
child. If the ball makes 12.0 revolutions, what is its diameter?
