repulsion between the highly positive charge of the gold nucleus and the positive charge 
of the a particle was strong enough to deflect the particle, as shown in Figure 2.9. 
Subsequent experiments led to the discovery of positive particles (protons) and 
neutral particles (neutrons) in the nucleus. Protons were discovered in 1919 by Ruth-
erford and neutrons in 1932 by British scientist James Chadwick (1891–1972). Thus, the 
atom is composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons.

What is the charge on the particles that form the beam? Will they be 
attracted to or repelled from the positively charged gold nuclei?

Most a particles
undergo little to no

most of the atom
is empty.
