at has a large amount of two different types of matrix material. The organic
matrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic
fibers. This gives strength and flexibility to the tissue. The inorganic matrix consists of mineral salts—mostly calcium

salts—that give the tissue hardness. Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate
inorganic material in the matrix, the tissue bends.
There are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone
for growth and remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they
continue to live, but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts
are active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to cal
