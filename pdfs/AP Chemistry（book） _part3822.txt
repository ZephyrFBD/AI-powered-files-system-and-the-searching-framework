s or octane 
enhancers increases the octane rating of gasoline. Until the mid-
1970s, the principal antiknock agent was tetraethyl lead 1C2H524Pb. 
It is no longer used, however, because of the environmental haz-
ards of lead and because it poisons catalytic converters. 
 (Sec-
tion 14.7, “Catalytic Converters”) Aromatic compounds such as 
toluene 1C6H5CH32 and oxygenated hydrocarbons such as ethanol 
1CH3CH2OH2 are now generally used as antiknock agents.
