FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EMBRYONIC
DEVELOPMENT
Cytoplasmic Determinants
When an eight-ball sea urchin embryo is separated into two halves, the
future development of the two halves depends on the plane in which they
are cut. If the dissection is longitudinal (A), producing embryos containing
cells from both animal and vegetal poles, subsequent development is
normal. If, however, the plane of dissection is horizontal (B), the result is
four abnormally developing embryos. This demonstrates that the
cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus has profound effects on embryonic
development. The importance of the cytoplasm in the development of the
embryo is known as cytoplasmic determinants; see Figure 18.10.
NOTE
This topic is important because itâ€™s about cell communication.
