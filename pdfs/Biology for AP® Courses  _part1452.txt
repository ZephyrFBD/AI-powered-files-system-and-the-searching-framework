in nature as a result of mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special DNA sequences capable
of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences).
Unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild
effects than aneuploid errors. However, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene
expression could be moved out of position with respect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.
An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere, or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere (Figure
13.11). A pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome
arms, making these inversions easily iden
