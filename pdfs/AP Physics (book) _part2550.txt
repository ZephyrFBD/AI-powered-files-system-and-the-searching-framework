NOTE Water in general is deeper than it looks—a useful safety guideline.

EXERCISE C Light passes from a medium with 
(water) into a medium with
(glass). Is the light bent toward or away from the perpendicular to the interface?

Refraction through flat glass. Light traveling in air strikes
a flat piece of uniformly thick glass at an incident angle of 60.0°, as shown in
Fig. 23–24. If the index of refraction of the glass is 1.50, (a) w
