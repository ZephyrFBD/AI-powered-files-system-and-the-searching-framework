ong as that in (a), and the 
frequency of the wave in (b) is therefore 
twice as great as that in (a).
Give It Some Thought
Our bodies are penetrated by X rays but not by visible light. Is this because X rays 
travel faster than visible light?

Is the wavelength of a microwave longer or shorter than the wavelength of visible 
light? By how many orders of magnitude do the two waves differ in wavelength?
