d or glass-fiber spacers 
are placed between them (Figure 20.19). Using a reaction whose reactants 
and products are solids has another benefit. Because solids are excluded from 
the reaction quotient Q, the relative amounts of Pb1s2, PbO21s2, and PbSO41s2 
have no effect on the voltage of the lead storage battery, helping the battery 
maintain a relatively constant voltage during discharge. The voltage does 
vary somewhat with use because the concentration of H2SO4 varies with the 
extent of discharge. As Equation 20.20 indicates, H2SO4 is consumed during 
the discharge.
A major advantage of the lead–acid battery is that it can be recharged. During 
recharging, an external source of energy is used to reverse the direction of the cell 
reaction, regenerating Pb(s) and PbO21s2:
2 PbSO41s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ PbO21s2 + Pb1s2 + 2 HSO4
-1aq2 + 2 H+1aq2
In an automobile, the alternator provides the energy necessary for recharging the 
battery. Recharging is possible because PbSO4 formed during dis
