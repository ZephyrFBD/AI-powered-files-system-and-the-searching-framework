on, and the measured rate of
hadron production in observed 
collisions at accelerators. The idea of color
soon became a central feature of the theory as determining the force binding
quarks together in a hadron.
Each quark is assumed to carry a color charge, analogous to electric charge,
and the strong force between quarks is referred to as the color force. This theory
of the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics (
in Greek),
or QCD, to indicate that the force acts between color charges (and not between,
say, electric charges). The strong force between two hadrons is considered to 
be a force between the quarks that make them up, as suggested in Fig. 32–17.

†Compare to the EM interaction, where the photon has no electric charge. Because gluons have color
charge, they could attract each other and form composite particles (photons cannot). Such “glueballs”
are being searched for.
