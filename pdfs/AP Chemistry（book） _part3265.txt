n electrons and are reduced to Na at 
the cathode, Figure 20.28. As Na+ ions near the cathode are depleted, additional Na+ ions 
migrate in. Similarly, there is net movement of Cl- ions to the anode where they are oxi-
dized. The electrode reactions for the electrolysis are
Cathode: 
 
2 Na+1l2 + 2 e- ยก 2 Na1l2
Anode: 
 
  
 
2 Cl-1l2 ยก Cl21g2 + 2 e-
Overall: 
   2 Na+1l2 + 2 Cl-1l2 ยก 2 Na1l2 + Cl21g2
Notice how the energy source is connected to the electrodes in Figure 20.28. The positive 
terminal is connected to the anode and the negative terminal is connected to the cath-
ode, which forces electrons to move from the anode to the cathode.
Because of the high melting points of ionic substances, the electrolysis of molten 
salts requires very high temperatures. Do we obtain the same products if we electrolyze 
the aqueous solution of a salt instead of the molten salt? Frequently, the answer is no 
because water itself might be oxidized to form O2 or reduced to form H2 rather than the
