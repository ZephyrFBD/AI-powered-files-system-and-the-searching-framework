▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Dry red beans contain 62% carbohydrate, 22% protein, 
and 1.5% fat. Estimate the fuel value of these beans. 
(b) During a very light activity, such as reading or watching 
television, the average adult expends about 7 kJ>min. How 
many minutes of such activity can be sustained by the energy 
provided by a serving of chicken noodle soup containing  
13 g protein, 15 g carbohydrate, and 5 g fat?
18 g protein2a
17 kJ
1 g proteinb + 126 g carbohydrate2a
17 kJ
1 g carbohydrate b
+ 12 g fat2a 38 kJ
1 g fatb = 650 kJ 1to two significant figures2
This corresponds to 160 kcal:
1650 kJ2a 1 kcal
4.18 kJ b = 160 kcal
Recall that the dietary Calorie is equivalent to 1 kcal. Thus, the 
serving provides 160 Cal.
