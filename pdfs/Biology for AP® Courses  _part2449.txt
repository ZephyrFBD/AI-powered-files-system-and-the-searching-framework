 living apart. This model,
however, does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can
interact. A biofilm is a microbial community (Figure 22.8) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily
of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. Biofilms grow attached to
surfaces. Some of the best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described
as well as some composed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria.
Biofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial
settings. In recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role. They also
colonize household surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human
body, such as the surfaces of our teeth.
