ers over Earth-bound
telescopes, which are limited in resolution by movement of the Earth’s atmosphere
to about half an arc second. (Each degree is divided into 60 minutes each
containing 60 seconds, so 
seconds.)
APPROACH Angular resolution for the Hubble is given (in radians) by Eq.25–7.
The resolution for Earth telescopes is given, and we first convert it to radians so
we can compare.
SOLUTION Earth-bound telescopes are limited to an angular resolution of
The Hubble, on the other hand, is limited by diffraction (Eq. 25–7) which for

Eye resolution. You are in an airplane at an
altitude of 10,000 m. If you look down at the ground, estimate the minimum
separation s between objects that you could distinguish. Could you count cars in
a parking lot? Consider only diffraction, and assume your pupil is about 3.0 mm
in diameter and
