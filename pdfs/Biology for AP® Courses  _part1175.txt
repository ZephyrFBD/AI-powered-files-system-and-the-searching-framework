ion. As the
chromosome is replicated, the two copies move
to opposite ends of the cell by an unknown
mechanism.
FtsZ proteins
assemble into a
ring that
pinches the cell
in two.
Some
protists
Linear chromosomes
exist in the nucleus.
Chromosomes attach to the nuclear envelope,
which remains intact. The mitotic spindle passes
through the envelope and elongates the cell. No
centrioles exist.
Microfilaments
form a
cleavage
furrow that
pinches the cell
in two.
Other
protists
Linear chromosomes
exist in the nucleus.
A mitotic spindle forms from the centrioles and
passes through the nuclear membrane, which
remains intact. Chromosomes attach to the
mitotic spindle, which separates the
chromosomes and elongates the cell.

Animal cells Linear chromosomes

A mitotic spindle forms from the centrosomes.
The nuclear envelope dissolves. Chromosomes
