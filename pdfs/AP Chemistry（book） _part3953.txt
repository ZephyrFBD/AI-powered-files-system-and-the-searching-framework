0.112 atm. Therefore, the equation for the line is
P = a4.10 * 10-4 atm

A.5 | Standard Deviation
The standard deviation from the mean, s, is a common method for describing precision 
in experimentally determined data. We define the standard deviation as
s = H
a
N
i = 1
1xi - x22
N - 1
where N is the number of measurements, x is the average (also called the mean) of the 
measurements, and xi represent the individual measurements. Electronic calculators 
with built-in statistical functions can calculate s directly by inputting the individual 
measurements.
A smaller value of s indicates a higher precision, meaning that the data are more 
closely clustered around the average. The standard deviation has statistical significance. 
If a large number of measurements is made, 68% of the measured values is expected to be 
within one standard deviation of the average, assuming only random errors are associ-
ated with the measurements.
