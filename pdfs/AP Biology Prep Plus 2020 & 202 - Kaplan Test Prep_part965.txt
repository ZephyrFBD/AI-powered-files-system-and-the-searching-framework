it less likely to be involved in
locomotion, (A). The lack of abundant space in the cell, due to the high
concentration of rough ER and Golgi bodies, make it unlikely that this
cell is involved in storage or transport, eliminating (C) and (D).
53. A
A major structural diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is
that eukaryotes possess organelles, which are structures that have
evolved to perform specialized functions. This means that diﬀerent
cells can have diﬀering concentrations of particular organelles,
corresponding to their function. This increases eﬀiciency, by ensuring
that resources are not wasted and that every cell has the tools it needs
to perform its function. Therefore, (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect
because both eukaryotes and prokaryotes may possess flagella, so it is
not an advantage for either group. (C) is incorrect because some
eukaryotes do, in fact, possess cell walls. Furthermore, the cell wall
mainly provides mechanical support to a cell; it is the cell mem
