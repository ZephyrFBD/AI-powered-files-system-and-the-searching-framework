trait, which is caused by a point
mutation.
The amino acid sequence will remain the same because
multiple codons code for the same amino acid.
The amino acid sequence will remain the same because 15% of
all codons code for the same amino acid.
The following is a codon sequence in a cell: …UGU CCC UAC
AGU … What would happen to the amino acid sequence if the
codon sequence sustains one mutation and the bold nucleotide
becomes A?
The amino acid sequence will remain unchanged because
multiple codons code for the same amino acid.
The amino acid sequence will remain unchanged because
almost every mutation is corrected by DNA proofreading.
The cell will be transformed into a cancer cell.
No amino acid sequence will be produced because UAA is a
Stop codon, and translation will not continue.
A particular triplet code on DNA is AAA. What is the anticodon for
it?
AAA
TTT
UUU
CCC
Which of the following is correct about DNA?
Almost 97% of the human genome are genes that code for
polypeptides.
