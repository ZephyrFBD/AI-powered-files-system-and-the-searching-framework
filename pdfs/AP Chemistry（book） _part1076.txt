d balls. This ricocheting happens because the elec-
tron clouds of the colliding atoms cannot penetrate each other to any significant extent. The 
shortest distance separating the two nuclei during such collisions is twice the radii of the 
atoms. We call this radius the nonbonding atomic radius or the van der Waals radius (Figure 7.6).
In molecules, the attractive interaction between any two adjacent atoms is what we 
recognize as a chemical bond. We discuss bonding in Chapters 8 and 9. For now, we need 
to realize that two bonded atoms are closer together than they would be in a nonbonding 
collision where the atoms ricochet apart. We can therefore define an atomic radius based 
on the distance between the nuclei when two atoms are bonded to each other, shown as 
distance d in Figure 7.6. The bonding atomic radius for any atom in a molecule is equal 
to half of the bond distance d. Note from Figure 7.6 that the bonding atomic radius (also 
known as the covalent radius) is smaller tha
