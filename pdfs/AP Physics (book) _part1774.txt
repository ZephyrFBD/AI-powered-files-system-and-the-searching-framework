itself, an electric field exists outside of it, as shown in
Fig. 16–34, as if the metal were not even there.
A related property of static electric fields and conductors is that the electric
field is always perpendicular to the surface outside of a conductor. If there were a
component of 
parallel to the surface (Fig. 16–35), it would exert a force on free
electrons at the surface, causing the electrons to move along the surface until
they reached positions where no net force was exerted on them parallel to the
surface—that is, until the electric field was perpendicular to the surface.
These properties apply only to conductors. Inside a nonconductor, which
does not have free electrons, a static electric field can exist as we will see in the next
Chapter. Also, the electric field outside a nonconductor does not necessarily make
an angle of 90° to the surface.
