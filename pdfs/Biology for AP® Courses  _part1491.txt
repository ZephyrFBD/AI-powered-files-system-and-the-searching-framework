its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and
eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage
with radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus,
32P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive
phosphorus.
Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a
blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down
in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in
the supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage,
whereas no radi
