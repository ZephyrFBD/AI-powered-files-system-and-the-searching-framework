Learning Objective 
2.29: The student can create representations and models 
to describe immune responses.
(A)
This option is incorrect. Ribosomes do not play a direct role in phagocytosis, 
although they are organelles that carry out protein synthesis.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Antibodies do not play a role in phagocytosis, a 
nonspecific immune response. Antibodies are involved in specific immune 
responses in the presence of specific antigens. Antibodies do not act  
intracellularly either.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding to interpret 
representations that describe a nonspecific immune response. In phagocytosis, 
a cell engulfs a bacterium by wrapping pseudopodia around it and packaging 
it within a membrane-enclosed vacuole. The bacterium is digested after 
the vacuole fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes. Digested 
particles can be exported out of the cell
