Crossing the pea plant that is heterozygous for both traits (TtGg) with a plant that is recessive for both traits
(ttgg) results in the following possible combinations, each of which should occur 25 percent of the time: TtGg
(tall and green), Ttgg (tall and yellow), ttGg (short and green), and ttgg (short and yellow). Using the rules of
probability, there is a 1/2 likelihood of it being tall and also a 1/2 likelihood of it being yellow. Multiply them
together to get 1/4.

Because the woman is a carrier, she must have one normal copy of the X chromosome and one diseased copy.
Since the boy will receive an X chromosome from his mother, there is a 50 percent chance that he will receive

They both must have a normal copy of the X chromosome. It is possible that the woman may be affected with
hemophilia; however, that scenario is extremely unlikely beca
