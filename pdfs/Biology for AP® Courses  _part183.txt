, and sulfur. The proteins
that make up hair contain sulfur bonded to another sulfur, which is called a disulfide bond. These covalent
bonds give hair its shape and texture. Heat from a hair straightener breaks the disulfide bonds, which
causes the hair to lose its curl. Why do you think this method of hair straightening isn’t permanent?
Figure 2.13
The shape of hair proteins is maintained by a combination of hydrogen bonds and covalent, disulfide bonds. Heat is
sufficient to break the hydrogen bonds, but harsh chemicals are required to break the disulfide bonds. Why is it harder
to break the disulfide bonds than the hydrogen bonds?
a.
Covalent bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds.
b.
There are many more disulfide bonds than hydrogen bonds.
c.
Covalent bonds are stronger than disulfide bonds.
d.
Covalent bonds are less elastic than hydrogen bonds.
