Observed color of light under water. We
said that color depends on wavelength. For example, light of wavelength
650 nm in air, we see red. If we observe the same object when under 
water, it still looks red. But the wavelength in water 
is (Eq. 24–1)
Light with wavelength 489 nm in air
would appear blue in air. Can you explain why the light appears red rather than
blue when observed under water?
RESPONSE Today we have little doubt that it is our brains that express colors,
based on the wavelengths of light that strike the receptor cells within the retina
(at the rear of the eyeball, as diagrammed in the next Chapter, Fig. 25–9). For
objects under water, the water does nothing to change the frequency, but does
change the wavelength to 
When that light enters the eye, the frequency
is still unchanged, but the speed is changed to 
where 
is the index of
refraction of the fluid that fills the interior of the eye and is in contact with the
retina. The
