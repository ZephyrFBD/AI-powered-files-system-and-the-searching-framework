as that on the
original object since the surrounding fluid, which exerts 
is in exactly the same
configuration. This body of fluid 
is in equilibrium (the fluid as a whole is at rest).
Therefore,
where 
is the weight of the body of fluid 
Hence the
buoyant force 
is equal to the weight of the body of fluid whose volume equals
the volume of the original submerged object, which is Archimedes’ principle.
Archimedes’ discovery was made by experiment. What we have done is show
that Archimedes’ principle can be derived from Newton’s laws.
Two pails of water. Consider two iden-
tical pails of water filled to the brim. One pail contains only water, the other has
a piece of wood floating in it. Which pail has the greater weight?
RESPONSE Both pails weigh the same. Recall Archimedes’ principle: the wood
displaces a volume of water with weight equal to the weight of the wood. Some
water will overflow the pail, but Archimedes’ principle tells us the spilled water
has weight equal to the weight of
