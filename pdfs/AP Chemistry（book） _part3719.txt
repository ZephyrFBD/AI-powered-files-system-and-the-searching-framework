ed electrons in the d orbitals of the metal ion. The energy dia-
gram in Figure 23.28 shows how these ligand point charges affect the energies of the d 
orbitals. First, we imagine the complex as having all the ligand point charges uniformly 
distributed on the surface of a sphere centered on the metal ion. The average energy of 
the metal ion’s d orbitals is raised by the presence of this uniformly charged sphere. 
Hence, the energies of all five d orbitals are raised by the same amount.
This energy picture is only a first approximation, however, because the ligands are 
not distributed uniformly on a spherical surface and, therefore, do not approach the 
metal ion equally from every direction. Instead, we envision the six ligands approach-
ing along x-, y-, and z-axes, as shown on the right in Figure 23.28. This arrangement of 
ligands is called an octahedral crystal-field. Because the metal ion’s d orbitals have dif-
ferent orientations and shapes, they do not all experience the sam
