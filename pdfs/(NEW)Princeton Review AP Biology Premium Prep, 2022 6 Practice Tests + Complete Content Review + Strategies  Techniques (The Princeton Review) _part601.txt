ales for Disease 2.
There are 21 males and 4 are affected = 4/21
There are 20 females and 0 are affected = 0/21
c. Identify the likely inheritance patterns of Disease 1 and Disease 2.
Disease 1 is autosomal dominant
Disease 2 is X-linked recessive
d. Describe how inheritance patterns are shaped by the chromosomes upon which the genes are located.
If a gene is located on an X or a Y chromosome, then it will be inherited differently in males and female since males
have XY and females have XX. This is sex-linked inheritance. In this pedigree with X-linked recessive, the affected males
never have affected fathers. They get the mutated X from their mothers, but the mothers are never affected with the
disease themselves. Things on autosomes get inherited the same in males and females because they each have the
same number of autosomes.
