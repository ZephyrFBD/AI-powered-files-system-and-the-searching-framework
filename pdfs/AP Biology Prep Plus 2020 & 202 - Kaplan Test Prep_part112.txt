ion in size among the species, it is plausible to
believe that multiple genes control the size of the birds. Consequently,
it is quite probable that the species would respond relatively quickly to
selective pressure for a particular size, making (D) correct. (A) and (C)
are incorrect because the question stem states that diﬀerences in color
and beak depend on single genes with only two distinctive alleles.
Thus, it is improbable that intermediate forms would develop easily.
(B) is incorrect because none of the birds currently possess fur and it
would be highly unlikely that this completely novel trait would arise in
the species simply as a result of random mutations. It is far more
probable that the species would develop thicker feathers in a colder
environment rather than an entirely diﬀerent type of protective
covering.

The atmosphere of the Earth was very low in oxygen content when life
arose, so early life had to be able to thrive in an anaerobic
