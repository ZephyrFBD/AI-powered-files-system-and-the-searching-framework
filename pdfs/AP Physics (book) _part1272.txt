 camera. The time between emission and 
reception by the camera of these waves allows the camera 
mechanism to adjust the lens to focus at the proper distance.
Autofocusing with sound waves. Autofocusing cameras
emit a pulse of very high frequency (ultrasonic) sound that travels to the object
being photographed, and include a sensor that detects the returning reflected
sound, as shown in Fig. 12–1. To get an idea of the time sensitivity of the detector,
calculate the travel time of the pulse for an object (a) 1.0 m away, and (b) 20 m away.
APPROACH If we assume the temperature is about 20°C, then the speed of
sound is 
Using this speed v and the total distance d back and forth in
each case, we can obtain the time
SOLUTION (a) The pulse travels 1.0 m to the object and 1.0 m back, for a total
of 2.0 m. We solve for in
(b) The total distance now is
so
NOTE Newer autofocus cameras use infrared light
instead
of ultrasound, and/or a digital sensor array that detects light intensity differ-
