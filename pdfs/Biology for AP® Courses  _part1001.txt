Cell signaling is vital to the survival of organisms. For example, chemical signals tell cells when to make hormones such as
insulin. Cell division also depends on chemical signals. When the chemical signals do not function properly, cells can divide
uncontrollably, forming cancerous tumors. Scientists recently discovered a cell signaling pathway that protects cancer cells
from being killed by the body’s immune system. The hope is to use this knowledge to create treatments that target this cell
signaling pathway so that the cancer cells self destruct. More about that can be found here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
