†When the resonant frequencies above the fundamental (that is, the overtones) are integral multiples of
the fundamental, as here, they are called harmonics. But if the overtones are not integral multiples 
of the fundamental, as is the case for a vibrating drumhead, for example, they are not harmonics.

FIGURE 12–8 The wavelength of
(a) an unfingered string is longer
than that of (b) a fingered string.
Hence, the frequency of the fingered
string is higher. Only one string is
shown on this guitar, and only the
simplest standing wave, the 
fundamental, is shown
