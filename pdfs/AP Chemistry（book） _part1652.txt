CHAPTER 10 Gases
10.12  The graph below shows the change in pressure as the tem-
perature increases for a 1-mol sample of a gas confined to a 
1-L container. The four plots correspond to an ideal gas and 
three real gases: CO2, N2, and Cl2. (a) At room temperature, 
all three real gases have a pressure less than the ideal gas. 
Which van der Waals constant, a or b, accounts for the influ-
ence intermolecular forces have in lowering the pressure of a 
real gas? (b) Use the van der Waals constants in Table 10.3 to 
match the labels in the plot (A, B, and C) with the respective 
gases 1CO2, N2, and Cl22. [Section 10.9]
