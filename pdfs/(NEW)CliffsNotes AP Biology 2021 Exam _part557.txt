The Excretory System
In general, excretory systems help maintain homeostasis in organisms by regulating water balance and by removing
harmful substances.
Osmoregulation is the absorption and excretion of water and dissolved substances (solutes) so that proper water
balance (and osmotic pressure) is maintained between the organism and its surroundings. Two examples follow:
1. Marine fish. The body of a marine fish is hypoosmotic with its environmentâ€”that is, it is less salty than the
surrounding water. Thus, water is constantly lost by osmosis. In order to maintain their proper internal environment,
marine fish constantly drink, rarely urinate, and secrete accumulated salts (that they acquire when they drink) out
through their gills by active transport.
2. Freshwater fish. The body of a freshwater fish is hyperosmotic, or saltier than the surrounding water. Thus, water
constantly diffu
