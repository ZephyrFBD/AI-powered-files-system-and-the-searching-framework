For example, 209 J is required to increase the temperature of 50.0 g of water by 1.00 K. 
Thus, the specific heat of water is

Notice how the units combine in the calculation. A temperature change in kelvins is 
equal in magnitude to the temperature change in degrees Celsius: ∆T in K = ∆T in °C.  
(Section 1.5) Therefore, this specific heat for water can also be reported as 4.18 J>g@°C, 
where the unit is pronounced “Joules per gram-degree Celsius.”
Because the specific heat values for a given substance can vary slightly with tem-
perature, the temperature is often precisely specified. The 4.18 J/g-K value we use here for 
water, for instance, is for water initially at 14.5 °C (Figure 5.17). Water’s specific heat at this 
temperature is used to define the calorie at the value given in Section 5.1: 1 cal = 4.184 J 
exactly.
When a sample absorbs heat (positive q), its te
