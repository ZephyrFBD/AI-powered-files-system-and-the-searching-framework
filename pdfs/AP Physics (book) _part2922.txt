Reading a magazine on a spaceship. A passenger on a
fictional high-speed spaceship traveling between Earth and Jupiter at a steady
speed of 0.75c reads a magazine which takes 10.0 min according to her watch.
(a) How long does this take as measured by Earth-based clocks? (b) How much
farther is the spaceship from Earth at the end of reading the article than it 
was at the beginning?
APPROACH (a) The time interval in one reference frame is related to the time
interval in the other by Eq. 26–1a or b. (b) At constant speed, distance is
Because there are two time intervals (
and 
) we will get
