Equal masses. Billiard ball A of mass m moving with
speed
collides head-on with ball B of equal mass. What are the speeds of the two
balls after the collision, assuming it is elastic? Assume (a) both balls are moving
initially (
and 
), (b) ball B is initially at rest
APPROACH There are two unknowns,
and 
so we need two indepen-
dent equations. We focus on the time interval from just before the collision 
until just after. No net external force acts on our system of two balls (mg and
the normal force cancel), so momentum is conserved. Conservation of kinetic
energy applies as well because we are told the collision is elastic.
SOLUTION (a) The masses are equal  
so conservation of
momentum gives
We need a second equation, because there are two unknowns.We could use the
conservation of kinetic energy equation, or the simpler Eq. 7–7 derived from it:
We add these two equations and obtain
and then subtract the two equations to obtain
That is, th
