In plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue. When different types of tissues work together
to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. Vascular plants have two
distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (non-
reproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include
flowers and fruits. The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis.
The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals,
