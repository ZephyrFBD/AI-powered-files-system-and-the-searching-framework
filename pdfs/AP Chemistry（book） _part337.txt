Give the chemical formulas for (a) hydrobromic acid,  
(b) carbonic acid.
SOLUTION
(a)  
The anion from which this acid is derived is CN-, the cyanide 
ion. Because this ion has an -ide ending, the acid is given a 
hydro- prefix and an -ic ending: hydrocyanic acid. Only water 
solutions of HCN are referred to as hydrocyanic acid. The pure 
compound, which is a gas under normal conditions, is called 
 
hydrogen  
cyanide. Both hydrocyanic acid and hydrogen  
cyanide are  
extremely toxic.
(b)  
Because NO3
- is the nitrate ion, HNO3 is called nitric acid (the 
-ate ending of the anion is replaced with an -ic ending in nam-
ing the acid).
(c)  
Because SO4
2- is the sulfate ion, H2SO4 is called sulfuric acid.
(d)  
Because SO3
2- is the sulfite ion, H2SO3 is sulfurous acid (the 
-ite ending of the anion is replaced with an -ous ending).
