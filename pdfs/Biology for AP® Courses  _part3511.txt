ng the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain
the same length. The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the
named bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. The mechanism of contraction is
the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (Figure 29.36).

Figure 29.36 When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller. The A
band stays the same width and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.
When a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length. A sarcomere is defined as the
distance between two consecutive Z discs or Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the Z discs is reduced.
