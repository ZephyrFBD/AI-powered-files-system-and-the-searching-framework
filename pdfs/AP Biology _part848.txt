You will build a choice chamber to study which environment the flies
prefer.
Choose a large enough sample of fruit flies. For example, 30 flies is a
good sample size. A sample of 10 flies is too small. However, 100 may be
too difficult to manage and might result in errors.
Build a choice chamber. Use two graduated cylinders or clear plastic
water bottles with the necks cut off.
To test the hypothesis that fruit flies prefer specific lighting conditions,
put them to sleep. Place the flies into the choice chamber, and seal the
cover of the choice chamber with clear tape. Cover one side of the choice
chamber to prevent light from entering it, and leave both chambers
undisturbed. When the flies wake up, you can observe them. After what
you determine is an appropriate amount of time, remove the cover and
tape. Then place a piece of cardboard over each chamber to keep the flies
in. Count the flies in each chamber.
To test the hypothesis that flies prefer one temperature over another,
