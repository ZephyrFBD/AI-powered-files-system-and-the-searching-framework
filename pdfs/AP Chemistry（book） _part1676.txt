us container—and the mass does 
not change over time, so you do not have a leak. Suggest an 
explanation for your observations.
   
 
 
 
 
10.79 The temperature of a 5.00-L container of N2 gas is in-
creased from 20 °C to 250 °C. If the volume is held constant, 
predict qualitatively how this change affects the following: 
 
(a) the average kinetic energy of the molecules; (b) the root- 
mean-square speed of the molecules; (c) the strength of the 
impact of an average molecule with the container walls; (d) the 
total number of collisions of molecules with walls per second.

CHAPTER 10 Gases
 
10.80 Suppose you have two 1-L flasks, one containing N2 at STP
, 
the other containing CH4 at STP
. How do these systems com-
pare with respect to (a) number of molecules, (b) density, 
 
(c) average kinetic energy of the molecules, (d) rate of effu-
sion through a pinhole leak?
 
10.81 (a) Place the following gases in order of increasing average 
molecular speed at 25 °C: Ne, HBr, SO2, NF3,
