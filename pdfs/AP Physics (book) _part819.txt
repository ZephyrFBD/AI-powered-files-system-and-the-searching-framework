 
of an object is directly 
proportional to the net applied torque 
and we see that it is torque that gives rise to angular acceleration. This is the 
rotational analog of Newton’s second law for linear motion,
We defined the lever arm as the perpendicular distance from the axis of rota-
tion to the line of action of the force—that is, the distance which is perpendicular
both to the axis of rotation and to an imaginary line drawn along the direction of
the force. We do this to take into account the effect of forces acting at an angle. It
is clear that a force applied at an angle, such as 
in Fig. 8–12, will be less effec-
tive than the same magnitude force applied perpendicular to the door, such as 
(Fig. 8–12a). And if you push on the end of the door so that the force is directed
at the hinge (the axis of rotation), as indicated by 
the door will not rotate at all.
The lever arm for a force such as 
is found by drawing a line along the
direction of 
(this is the “line of action” of
