 several other processes could block
protein production before mRNA gets to the ribosomes.
(C) The curve to the right shows a lower affinity for oxygen. CO2
dissolved in water produces carbonic acid. What this graph
demonstrates is that the blood near respiring cells, which release
carbon dioxide, make the surrounding area more acidic. This
environment causes hemoglobin to release its oxygen to the cells
where it is needed.
(A) Choice B is incorrect because no evidence is provided in the
question about bananas not having separate sexes. Choice C is
incorrect because meiosis, not mitosis, produces gametes. Choice D
is incorrect because, while it is true that there can be no crossing-
over if there is no synapsis (when homologous pairs line up to
exchange DNA), gametes could still form. However, there would
not be any variation in the gametes.
(C) The energy to maintain each gram of body mass is inversely
related to body size. This graph describes a relationship between X
and Y that is i
