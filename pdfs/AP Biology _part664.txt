arcolemma,
depolarizes the muscle cell membrane, and sets up an action potential.
The impulse moves along the sarcolemma, into the T system, and
stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca++. The Ca++ ions
then alter the troponin-tropomyosin relationship and the muscle contracts.
Summation and Tetanus
A single action potential in a muscle will cause the muscle to contract
locally and minutely for a few milliseconds and then to relax. This brief
contraction is called a twitch. If a second action potential arrives before
the first response is over, there will be a summation effect and the
contraction will be greater. If a muscle receives a series of overlapping
action potentials, even further summation will occur. If the rate of
stimulation is fast enough, the twitches will blur into one smooth,
sustained contraction called tetanus (not related to the disease of the same
name). Tetanus is what occurs when a large muscle such as the bicep
muscle contracts. If the muscle continues
