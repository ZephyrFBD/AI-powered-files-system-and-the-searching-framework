nes with the improved model 2 effectively and gives a practical 
distribution way that is based on the demand. On the hand of details, the 
model gives a more practical way of combining the vertical transport with 
the lateral transport to save time and cost, having certain guidance 
meaning to reality. The assumption that one week is a cycle is reasonable. 
Medical help is timely and it is good for adjusting distribution strategy 
according to the changing actual situation. The delivery model is practical 
and reasonable. 
 Weakness: Due to the lack of data, we can’t predict accurately the

demand of each city In the next week. And after drugs used, the situation 
would change. The model can’t predict the concrete effect. That’s what we 
need to improve. 
 
IV. Conclusions  
4.1 Spread Model: 
To estimate the developments of EVA in the next 200 weeks (from 
2014/3/1), we use differential equat
