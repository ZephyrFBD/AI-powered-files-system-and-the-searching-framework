3.1.3 The Reference Number 
Let t be a real number. The reference number t bar associated with t is the shortest 
distance along the unit circle between the terminal point determined by t and the x-axis. 
The figure below shows that to find the reference number. It is helpful to know the 
quadrant in which the terminal point determined by t lies.  
 
If the terminal point lies in Quadrant I or IV, where x is positive, we find the reference 
number by moving along the circle to the positive x-axis. 
If it lies in Quadrant II or III, where x is negative, we find the reference number by moving 
along the circle to the negative x-axis.
