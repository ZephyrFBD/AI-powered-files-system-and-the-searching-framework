because hawks also prey on 
voles whereas coyotes do not, hawks still will have a source of energy.
Question 13
Essential Knowledge
4.A.1: The subcomponents of biological molecules and 
their sequence determine the properties of that molecule. 
Science Practice
6.1: The student can justify claims with evidence.
Learning Objective 
4.3: The student is able to use models to predict and 
justify that changes in the subcomponents of a biological 
polymer affect the functionality of the molecule.
(A)
This option is incorrect. Although it is true that T (thymine) is a not a component 
of RNA and is replaced by U (uracil), both DNA Segments 1 and 2 must undergo 
transcription to produce mRNA.
(B)
This option is incorrect. A nucleotide monomer of DNA consists of a phosphate 
group, deoxyribose, and a nitrogenous base (A, T, C, or G). Although phosphate 
groups make DNA polar and therefore soluble in water, because both DNA 
segments have the same number of nucleotide base pairs (11), they have
