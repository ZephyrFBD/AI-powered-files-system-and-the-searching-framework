st points to determine 
whether the graph of the polynomial lies above or below the x-axis on the intervals 
determined by the zeros. Include the y-intercept in the table. 
3. End Behavior. Determine the end behavior of the polynomial. 
4. Graph. Plot the intercepts and other points you found in the table. Sketch a smooth 
curve that passes through these points and exhibits the required end behavior.

1.6.5 Shape of the Graph Near a Zero 
In general, if c is a zero of P and the corresponding factor x − c occurs exactly m times in 
the factorization of P, then we say that c is a zero of multiplicity m. 
Moreover, it can be shown by using calculus that near x = c the graph has the same 
general shape as y = A (x-c)m. 
If c is a zero of P of multiplicity m, then the shape of the graph of P near c is as follows.
