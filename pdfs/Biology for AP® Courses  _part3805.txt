 ducts that line the medullary pyramids. The collecting ducts amass contents
from multiple nephrons and fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla.
Capillary Network within the Nephron
The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered. The
branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole. The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent
arteriole. Within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed. Once the efferent arteriole
exits the glomerulus, it forms the peritubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal
tubule. In cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT. In juxtamedullary nephrons, the
peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta.
