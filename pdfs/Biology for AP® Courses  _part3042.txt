 the connections that
neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive
synaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to
receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.

Figure 26.3 Neurons contain organelles common to many other cells, such as a nucleus and mitochondria. They
also have more specialized structures, including dendrites and axons.
Types of Neurons
There are different types of neurons, and the functional role of a given neuron is intimately dependent on its structure. There
is an amazing diversity of neuron shapes and sizes found in different parts of the nervous system (and across species), as
illustrated by the neurons shown in Figure 26.4.
