al., JBC, 2007). This process has a role in the synthesis of
the melanosomes that cause skin pigmentation. A mutation
in this gene affecting a single amino acid occurs in
humans. The homozygous mutant gene is found in 99% of
humans with European origins. Both the wild type and
mutant display codominance.
A. Representing the wild-type form of the gene as +/+ and
the mutant form of the gene as m/m for two homozygous
parents, construct a Punnett square for this cross using the
first grid below. Annotate your representation to
identify the pheno
