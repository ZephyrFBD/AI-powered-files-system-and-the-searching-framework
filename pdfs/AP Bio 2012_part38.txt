26. According to the results of this experiment, 
germination of tobacco seeds during the first 
week is 
(A) increased by exposure to light 
(B) unaffected by light intensity 
(C) prevented by paper towels 
(D) accelerated in green-leaved seedlings 
 
27. The most probable cause for the difference in 
mean stem length between plants in dish A and 
plants in dish B is which of the following? 
(A) Shortening of cells in the stem in response to  
the lack of light 
(B) Elongation of seedlings in response to the 
lack of light 
(C) Enhancement of stem elongation by light 
(D) Genetic differences between the seeds 
 
28. Which of the following best supports the 
hypothesis that the difference in leaf color is 
genetically controlled? 
(A) The number of yellow-leaved seedlings in 
dish A on day 7 
(B) The number of germinated see
