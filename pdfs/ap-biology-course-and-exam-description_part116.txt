s 
not violate the second law of thermodynamics—
a. Energy input must exceed energy 
loss to maintain order and to power 
cellular processes.
b.  
Cellular processes that release energy may 
be coupled with cellular processes that 
require energy. 
c. 
EXCLUSION STATEMENT 
—Students will 
need to understand the concept of energy, but the 
equation for Gibbs free energy is beyond the scope 
of the course and the AP Exam.
ENE-1.H.3
Energy-related pathways in biological systems 
are sequential to allow for a more controlled 
and efficient transfer of energy. A product of 
a reaction in a metabolic pathway is generally 
the reactant for the subsequent step in 
the pathway.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-1
The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
