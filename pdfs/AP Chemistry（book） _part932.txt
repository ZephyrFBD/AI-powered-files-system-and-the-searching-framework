The revolutions in scientiﬁc thinking caused by the theory of relativity 
and quantum theory not only changed science; it also caused deep 
changes in how we understand the world around us. Before relativity 
and quantum theory, the prevailing physical theories were inherently 
 
deterministic: Once the speciﬁc conditions of an object were given 
 
(position, velocity, forces acting on the object), we could determine 
 
exactly the position and motion of the object at any time in the future. 
These theories, from Newton’s laws to Maxwell’s theory of electromag-
netism, successfully described physical phenomena such as motion of 
the planets, the trajectories of projectiles, and the diffraction of light.
Relativity and quantum theory both challenged the determinis-
tic view of the universe, and did so in a way that caused a great deal of 
uneasiness among even the scientists who were developing the the-
ories. One of the common methods scientists used to test these new 
theori
