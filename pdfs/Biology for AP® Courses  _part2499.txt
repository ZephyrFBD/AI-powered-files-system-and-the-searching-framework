 the infecting bacteria, and
therefore only the resistant forms remain. These resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of
resistant forms over non-resistant ones. Another major misuse of antibiotics is in patients with colds or the flu, for which
antibiotics are useless. Another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock. The routine use of antibiotics in
animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well. In the United States, 70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to
animals. These antibiotics are given to livestock in low doses, which maximize the probability of resistance developing, and
these resistant bacteria are readily transferred to humans.

administration to livestock and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
In your own words, what is the problem with administering antibiotics to livestock when they are not in need of the
