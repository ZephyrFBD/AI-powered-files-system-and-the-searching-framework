ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
IST-1
Heritable information provides for continuity of life.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.P
Explain the use of genetic 
engineering techniques in 
analyzing or manipulating 
DNA.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.P.1
Genetic engineering techniques can be used to 
analyze and manipulate DNA and RNA—
a.	Electrophoresis separates molecules 
according to size and charge.
b.	During polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
DNA fragments are amplified. 
c.	Bacterial transformation introduces DNA into 
bacterial cells.
d.	DNA sequencing determines the order of 
nucleotides in a DNA molecule.
