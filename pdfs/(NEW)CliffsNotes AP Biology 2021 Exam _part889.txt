es have two, the expression of X-linked genes in females is
potentially twice that of males. In order to compensate for this inequality, one of the female chromosomes is
inactivated, leaving only one chromosome to produce transcripts. This is called X-inactivation. Which of the two X
chromosomes that is inactivated is determined randomly and independently in each cell early in embryonic
development. Once inactivation occurs, all descendents of the cell have the same chromosome inactivated. The
result produces groups of cells all with the same X chromosome inactivated adjacent to other groups of cells with a
different X chromosome inactivated. For the trait in this question, the disease in heterozygous females is expressed
as patches of skin without sweat glands and only some teeth missing.
54. C. Because selection of one of the two X chromosomes that becomes inactivated occurs randomly and
independently in early embryonic cells, each female twin will have different X chromosomes inacti
