 interact with the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid
bilayer; amino acids N and R are hydrophilic, so they will be in regions that associate with the aqueous
environment inside and outside of the cell
Transmembrane proteins span the entirety of a phospholipid bilayer. They have hydrophobic
regions that contain a high fraction of hydrophobic amino acids and hydrophilic regions that
contain a high fraction of hydrophilic amino acids. Hydrophobic regions can be found in the
interior of the cell membrane, while hydrophilic regions are found in contact with the aqueous
intracellular and extracellular environments. Thus, amino acids A and F, which are
hydrophobic, will be on the interior, and amino acids N and R, which are hydrophilic, will be on
the exterior.
