 must 
be transcribed into RNA. Some of the RNAs are used immediately for ribosomes or 
to control other cellular processes. Other RNAs are translated into proteins that have 
important roles in determining metabolism and development, i.e., cellular activities 
and phenotypes (traits). When the DNA of a cell changes, the RNAs and proteins they 
produce often change, which in turn changes how that cell functions. 
DNA inside a cell can change several ways. It can be mutated, either spontaneously 
or after the DNA replication machinery makes an error. Biotechnologists may cause an 
intentional mutation in a cellâ€™s own DNA as a way to change how that cell behaves. The 
most powerful tool biotechnologists have, though, is the ability to transfer DNA from 
one organism to another and make it function there. With this tool, they can make cells 
produce novel protein products the cells did not make previously. 
Examples of this powerful tool are all around us. Insulin that people take to cont
