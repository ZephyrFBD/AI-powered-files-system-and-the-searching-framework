(e) The electron-deﬁcient NO molecule is attracted to electron-rich 
F2 so the driving force for formation of the transition state is greater 
than simple random collisions.

(b) A reactant that is attracted to the lone pair of electrons on nitro-
gen will produce a tetrahedral intermediate. This can be a moiety 
with a full, partial, or even transient positive charge.

15.1 (a) kf 7 kr (b) The equilibrium constant is greater than one. 
15.3 K is greater than one. 15.5 A(g) + B(g) ∆AB(g) has the larger 
equilibrium constant. 15.6 From the smallest to the largest equi-
librium constant, (c) 6 (b) 6  (a). 15.7 Statement (b) is true. 15.9 
Two B atoms should be added to the diagram. 15.11 Kc decreases as 
T increases, so the reaction is exothermic. 15.13 (a) K = 8.1 * 10-3. 
(b) At equilibrium, the partial pressure of A is greater than the partial 
pressure of B.
