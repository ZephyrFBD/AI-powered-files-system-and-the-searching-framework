t the trapped air in order
to “pop off” the stopper? Assume the air surrounding the
test tube is always at a pressure of 1.00 atm.
37. (III) An air bubble at the bottom of a lake 41.0 m deep has
a volume of 
If the temperature at the bottom is
5.5°C and at the top 18.5°C, what is the radius of the bubble
just before it reaches the surface?

39. (I) How many moles of water are there in 1.000 L at STP?
How many molecules?
40. (II) Estimate the number of (a) moles and (b) molecules
of water in all the Earth’s oceans. Assume water covers
75% of the Earth to an average depth of 3 km.
41. (II) The lowest pressure attainable using the best available
vacuum techniques is about 
At such a pressure,
how many molecules are there per 
at 0°C?
42. (II) Is a gas mostly empty space? Check by assuming that
the spatial extent of the gas molecules in air is about
so one gas molecule occup
