wn we sail into New York. I’m sure I’m in a film, 
 
 that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema.The priest 
 
 wants to point out things but he doesn’t have to. I can pick out the 
 
 Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler 
 
 Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding 
 
 along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans 
 
 in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous 
 
 women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm 
 
 comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world. 
 
 The Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who 
 
 climbed aboard from a tugboat.Why can’t we get off here? Why do we 
 
 have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany? 
 
 The man says, Because you’re passengers on the vessel and the captain 
 
 is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore. 
 
 Oh, yeah.Well, this is a free country and w
