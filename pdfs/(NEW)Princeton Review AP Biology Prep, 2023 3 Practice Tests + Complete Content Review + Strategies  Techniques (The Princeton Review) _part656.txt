structures in distantly related organisms. Choice (C), disruptive selection, is
selection that favors both extremes at the expense of the intermediates in a population. Choice (D), stabilizing
selection, is selection that favors the intermediates at the expense of the extreme phenotypes in a population.
52. D
Mutations produce genetic variability. All of the other answer choices are forms of asexual reproduction.
53. C
Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers. If you set up a pyramid of numbers, youâ€™ll see that the
herrings belong to the third trophic level.
54. A
The biomass is the total bulk of a particular living organism. The phytoplankton population has both the largest
biomass and the most energy.
55. C
A decrease in the herring population will lead to an increase in the number of crustaceans and a decrease in the
phytoplankton population. Reorder the organisms according to their trophic levels and determine which
populations will increase and decrease accordingly.
