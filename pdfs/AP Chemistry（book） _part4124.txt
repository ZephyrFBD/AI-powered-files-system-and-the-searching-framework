the anode. (b) The energy density of the silver oxide battery is most 
similar to the nickel-cadmium battery. The molar masses of the elec-
trode materials and the cell potentials for these two batteries are 
most similar. 20.13 (a) Oxidation is the loss of electrons. (b) Elec-
trons appear on the productsâ€™ side (right side). (c) The oxidant is the 
reactant that is reduced. (d) An oxidizing agent is the substance that 
promotes oxidation; it is the oxidant. 20.15 (a) True (b) false (c) true
