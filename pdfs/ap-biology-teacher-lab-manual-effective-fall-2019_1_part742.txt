hamber into quadrants that are counted separately by four different students. Vestigial 
wing flies take longer to arrive at the ends of a choice chamber, but they may be easier to 
transfer and count because they do not fly. 
Students should be warned that fruit flies are escape artists, and care should be taken 
to keep the flies contained. Some “lost” flies can be recaptured by making a fly trap with 
a small amount of vinegar or piece of fruit such as a banana or banana peel placed in a 
container with a funnel. Be sure that there is space at the bottom of the funnel so that 
the flies can enter the beaker to explore the vinegar or fruit. They typically do not escape 
back up through the funnel. 
Moving flies from one container to another can be challenging. Flies are tossed by 
using their tendency to move up (their negative geotaxis) to help control their transfer. 
To toss flies, students should gently tap a culture of flies on a table to force them down 
to the bottom of the cu
