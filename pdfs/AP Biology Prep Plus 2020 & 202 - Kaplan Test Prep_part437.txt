Autotrophs convert free energy in sunlight to ATP and NADPH to
produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide in the Calvin cycle.
Heterotrophs metabolize carbohydrates by hydrolysis, releasing
carbon dioxide in the Krebs cycle while synthesizing ATP, NADH, and
FADH2. Thus, the correct answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because the
Calvin cycle and Krebs cycle are switched: autotrophs use CO2 to make
glucose in the Krebs cycle, and heterotrophs produce CO2 as a waste
product in the Calvin cycle. (C) and (D) are incorrect because
heterotrophs do not use CO2 to make glucose.

Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy. First,
chlorophyll molecules arranged in photosystems embedded within
thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts trap energy. The absorbed light
energy of the photon is then transferred to an electron, and the excited
electron is transferred to a primary electron acceptor. The chlorop
