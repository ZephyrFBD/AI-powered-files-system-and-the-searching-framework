e that the pH 
changes rapidly from roughly 11 to 3 near the equiv-
alence point. Consequently, an indicator for this 
titration can change color anywhere in this range. 
Most strong acid–strong base titrations are carried 
out using phenolphthalein as an indicator because 
it changes color in this range (see Figure 16.8, 
 
p. 678). Several other indicators would also be satis-
factory, including methyl red, which, as the lower 
color band in Figure 17.12 shows, changes color in 
the pH range from about 4.2 to 6.0.
As noted in our discussion of Figure 17.11, 
because the pH change near the equivalence point 
becomes smaller as Ka decreases, the choice of indi-
cator for a weak acid–strong base titration is more 
critical than it is for titrations where both acid 
and base are strong. When 0.100 M CH3COOH
1Ka = 1.8 * 10-52 is titrated with 0.100 M NaOH, 
for example, the pH increases rapidly only over the 
pH range from about 7 to 11 (Figure 17.13). Phenol-
phthalein is therefore an id
