 dihydrogen phos-
phate, (e) potassium phosphide, (f) gallium arsenide.
 22.59  Account for the following observations: (a) Phosphorus 
forms a pentachloride, but nitrogen does not. (b) H3PO2 is 
a monoprotic acid. (c) Phosphonium salts, such as PH4Cl, 
can be formed under anhydrous conditions, but they can-
not be made in aqueous solution. (d) White phosphorus is 
more reactive than red phosphorus.
 22.60  Account for the following observations: (a) H3PO3 is a 
diprotic acid. (b) Nitric acid is a strong acid, whereas phos-
phoric acid is weak. (c) Phosphate rock is ineffective as a 
phosphate fertilizer. (d) Phosphorus does not exist at room 
temperature as diatomic molecules, but nitrogen does. 
 
(e) Solutions of Na3PO4 are quite basic.
 22.61  Write a balanced equation for each of the following reac-
tions: (a) preparation of white phosphorus from calcium 
phosphate, (b) hydrolysis of PBr3, (c) reduction of PBr3 to 
P4 in the gas phase, using H2.
