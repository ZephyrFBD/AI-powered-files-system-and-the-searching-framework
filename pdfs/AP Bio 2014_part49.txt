 some 
octopus species are only found near active 
hydrothermal vents? 
(A) Octopuses depend indirectly on inorganic 
compounds in the seawater surrounding 
hydrothermal vents. 
(B) Organisms capable of moving across the 
seafloor are more difficult to observe than 
are organisms that are rooted in place. 
(C) Genetic bottleneck events in isolated areas 
of the deep ocean adversely affect some 
octopus populations but not others.  
 
(D) Biomass in a typical marine food web is 
expected to be greater in higher trophic 
levels than in lower trophic levels.

11. On a large volcanic island, researchers are 
studying a population of annual herbaceous 
plants. Which of the following observations best 
supports the prediction that speciation will occur 
within the existing plant population? 
(A) Individuals of the species sometimes 
reproduce asexually by producing runners. 
(B) L
