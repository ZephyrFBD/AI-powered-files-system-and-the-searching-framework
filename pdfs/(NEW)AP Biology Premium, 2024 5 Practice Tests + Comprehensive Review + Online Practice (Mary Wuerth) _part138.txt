Movement of Water in Cells
Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn:
➜
Water Potential
➜
Osmolarity and Its Regulation
Overview
Maintaining water balance in cells is a critical component of homeostasis, and life depends upon it. This chapter
provides an overview of water potential, discusses how to calculate water potential, and explains how differences in
water potential affect the movement of water into and out of cells.
Water Potential
In an introductory biology course, you may have learned the terms hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic. These three
terms focus on the relative concentrations of solute in a solution. A hypotonic solution has a lower concentration of
solute. A hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of solute. An isotonic solution has the same concentration
of solute as that of another solution.
Since hypotonic, hypertonic, and isoton
