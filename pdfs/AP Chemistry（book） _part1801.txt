 11.19  (a) List the following molecules in order of increasing polar-
izability: GeCl4, CH4, SiCl4, SiH4, and GeBr4. (b) Predict the 
order of boiling points of the substances in part (a).
 11.20  True or false: (a) For molecules with similar molecular 
weights, the dispersion forces become stronger as the mol-
ecules become more polarizable. (b) For the noble gases 
the dispersion forces decrease while the boiling points 
increase as you go down the column in the periodic table. 
(c) In terms of the total attractive forces for a given sub-
stance, dipoleâ€“dipole interactions, when present, are 
always greater than dispersion forces.(d) All other factors 
being the same, dispersion forces between linear mole-
cules are greater than those between molecules whose 
shapes are nearly spherical. (e) The larger the atom, the 
more polarizable it is.
 11.21  Which member in each pair has the greater dispersion 
forces? (a) H2O or H2S, (b)
