arger when a dielectric is between the plates. A capacitor 
whose plates are separated by an air gap has a charge 
on one plate and 
on the other (Fig. 17–19a). Assume it is isolated (not connected to a battery) so
charge cannot flow to or from the plates. The potential difference between the
plates,
is given by Eq. 17–7:
where the subscripts refer to air between the plates. Now we insert a dielectric
between the plates (Fig. 17–19b). Because of the electric field between the capac-
itor plates, the dielectric molecules will tend to become oriented as shown in 
Fig. 17–19b. If the dielectric molecules are polar, the positive end is attracted to
the negative plate and vice versa. Even if the dielectric molecules are not polar,
electrons within them will tend to move slightly toward the positive capacitor
plate, so the effect is the same. The net effect of the aligned dipoles is a net nega-
tive charge on the outer edge of the dielectric facing the positive plate, and a net
positive char
