Regulation of the Cell Cycle, Cancer, and Apoptosis
Proper regulation of the cell cycle is critical to appropriate growth, repair, and reproduction of cells in living
organisms. This regulation is achieved through the use of checkpoints during the cell cycle. Some of these
checkpoints are controlled by the interactions between cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin-dependent
kinases are present at constant levels throughout the cell cycle. These kinases add phosphate groups to other
molecules, activating those molecules. However, cyclin-dependent kinases themselves are inactive until they are
bound to cyclin proteins. The levels of cyclin proteins vary during the cell cycle, reaching their maximum just
before mitosis starts. When cyclins are bound to cyclin-dependent kinases, a complex called mitosis-promoting
factor (MPF) is formed. MPF triggers the start of mitosis. See Figure 11.2.
