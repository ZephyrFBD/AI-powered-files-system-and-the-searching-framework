20. Dehydration synthesis is a key part of the creation of many macromolecules. It is best described as
(A) loss of a water molecule in order to make something else
(B) water rushing out of a cell during the process of osmosis
(C) life moving out of the ocean and becoming complex
(D) kidneys filtering hydrophilic compounds during urine formation
21. When humans experience excessive heat loss, the nervous system sends random signals for skeletal muscles to
contract, resulting in shivering. This then raises the body temperature due to the production of heat. This
physiological mechanism is most similar to which other process?
(A) When a B-cell receptor binds to an infectious agent, signaling occurs to stimulate a larger immune
response.
(B) When blood sugar levels are sensed to be high in the body, insulin is released and blood sugar in the
bloodstream drops.
(C) When the uterus is stretched during contractions, this signals to the brain that oxytocin should be
