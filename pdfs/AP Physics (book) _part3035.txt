What Is an Electron?
We might ask ourselves: “What is an electron?” The early experiments of 
J. J. Thomson (Section 27–1) indicated a glow in a tube, and that glow moved when
a magnetic field was applied. The results of these and other experiments were best
interpreted as being caused by tiny negatively charged particles which we now call
electrons. No one, however, has actually seen an electron directly. The drawings we
sometimes make of electrons as tiny spheres with a negative charge on them are
merely convenient pictures (now recognized to be inaccurate). Again we must rely
on experimental results, some of which are best interpreted using the particle
model and others using the wave model. These models are mere pictures that we
use to extrapolate from the macro
