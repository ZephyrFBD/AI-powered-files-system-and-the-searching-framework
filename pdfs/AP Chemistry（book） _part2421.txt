constant, Kp, and the equilib-
rium partial pressures of two of the three substances in the equa-
tion 1N2 and H22, and we are asked to calculate the equilibrium 
partial pressure for the third substance 1NH32.
Plan We can set Kp equal to the equilibrium-constant expression 
and substitute in the partial pressures that we know. Then we can 
solve for the only unknown in the equation.

We tabulate the equilibrium pressures:
N21g2+ 3 H21g2 âˆ† 2 NH31g2
Equilibrium pressure 1atm2  0.432  0.928       x
Because we do not know the equilibrium pressure of NH3, we 
represent it with x. At equilibrium, the pressures must satisfy 
the equilibrium-constant expression:
Kp =
1P
NH322

10.432210.92823 = 1.45 * 10-5
We now rearrange the equation to solve for x:
 x2 = 11.45 * 10-5210.432210.92823 = 5.01 * 10-6
 x = 25.01 * 10-6 = 2.24 * 10-3 atm = P

Check We can always check our answer by using it to recalculate 
the value of the equilibrium constant:
Kp =
12.24 * 10-322
10.432
