ength of the cell cycle is roughly 24 hours with the majority of that time spent in Interphase,
getting prepared for mitosis. Of the cells that one would observe in mitosis, the predominant phase is
prophase.
Exercise 7C: Cancer and Mitosis
Interpretation of this Exercise
Be prepared to answer questions about how cancer can affect the cell cycle:
•
Increases the rate of mitosis.
•
Cells spent less time “checking” whether everything is in order before continuing through the rest
of the cell cycle; this “rush” causes mistakes to be made during replication and further mutations to
daughter cells.
•
Cells eventually can become so mutated that they do not resemble the original cells.
•
Signals to indicate that the cell has not replicated properly and that the cell should undergo
apoptosis (cell death) can be disregarded.
