.
d.
The macrophages in the recipient will identify
the MHC I molecules on transplanted organ as
non-self proteins, causing lysis of transplanted
cells. Other host cells will join to phagocytize
the foreign cells.
32. Suppose a person was born without the ability to
produce MHC I molecules. What problem would that
create?
a.
A person without the ability to produce MHC I
molecules would die immediately.
b.
A person without the ability to produce MHC I
molecules would recognize self as non-self,
resulting in autoimmune disease.
c.
The person’s immune system would not be able
to distinguish self and non-self. This would
make the person very vulnerable to infection.
d.
The person’s immune system would not be able
to destroy foreign pathogen due to lack of
hydrolytic enzymes. This would make the
person very vulnerable to infection.
33. Suppose a series of genetic mutations prevented some,
but not all, of the complement proteins from binding
antibodies or pathogens. Would the entire compleme
