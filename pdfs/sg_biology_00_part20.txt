 and anticodon
1 -  Complementarity – codons to anticodons, m-RNA base sequence to t-RNA base
       sequence
Translocation –with basic description
1 -  Peptide Formation – amino acids joined by peptide bonds to form polypeptide.
 Termination
1 -  Stop codon + release polypeptide + release ribosomes (must have 2 of 3)
1 -  Other or Elaboration – triplet code, recognition segments, wobble (redundancy)
One  point can be granted to either section of part b for describing the  movement of RNA from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm.
c) The genetic material from one bacterial cell enters another via transformation,
     transduction, OR conjugation. There is a 6  point maximum on this part. Choose
     one only!
Transformation (max 6 points)
1 -  Functional definition
1 -  Competency – cell membrane permeable to fragments
1 -  How to make competent – calcium chloride, heat shock, cold for stability, gene gun,
       electroporation
1-   Parameters for individual DNA segments – size, double helix
