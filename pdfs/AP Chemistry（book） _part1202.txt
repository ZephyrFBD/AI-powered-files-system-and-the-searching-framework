on energy of the hydride ion. (e) How does the pro-
cess in part (d) compare to the process for the electron affinity 
of a neutral hydrogen atom?
 
 (a) Write a balanced equation for the formation of SrO(s) 
from its elements. (b) Based on the ionic radii in Figure 7.8, 
predict the length of the side of the cube in the ﬁgure (the 
distance from the center of an atom at one corner to the cen-
ter of an atom at a neighboring corner). (c) The density of SrO 
is 5.10 g>cm3. Given your answer to part (b), how many for-
mula units of SrO are contained in the cube shown here?

 7.92  Group 4A elements have much more negative electron 
affinities than their neighbors in groups 3A and 5A (see 
Figure 7.12). Which of the following statements best explains 
this observation? (i) The group 4A eleme
