T80  Investigation 4 
 
This investigation consists of three parts. It is recommended that students work 
through all three sections. In Procedure 1, students use artificial cells to study the 
relationship of surface area and volume. In Procedure 2, they create models of living cells 
to explore osmosis and diffusion. Students finish by observing osmosis in living cells 
(Procedure 3). All three sections of the investigation provide opportunities for students 
to design and conduct their own experiments. 
â–  Understanding Water Potential 
In nonwalled cells, such as animal cells, the movement of water into and out of a cell is 
affected by the relative solute concentration on either side of the plasma membrane. As 
water moves out of the cell, the cell shrinks or undergoes crenation; if water moves into 
the cell, it swells and may eventually burst or lyse. In walled cells, including fungal and 
plant cells, the presence of a cell wall prevents the cells from
