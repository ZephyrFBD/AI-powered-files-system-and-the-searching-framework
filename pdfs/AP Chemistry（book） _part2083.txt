To find the normal boiling point of the pure solvent,
locate the point where the 1-atm pressure horizontal
line intersects the black vapor–pressure curve and
then track this point down to the temperature axis.
For the solution, the 1-atm line intersects the
blue vapor–pressure curve at a higher
temperature, indicating that the solution
has a higher boiling point than the pure solvent.

solvent’s phase equilibria curves, and the blue lines show the solution’s phase equilibria curves.

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
The freezing point of a solution is the temperature at which the first crystals of pure 
solvent form in equilibrium with the solution. Recall from Section 11.6 that the line rep
