Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can
perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies,
but everyoneâ€™s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz;
bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins 150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those
frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound.
Amplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in Figure 27.12.
The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. For sound, volume is measured in
decibels (dB). The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.
