1.7.4 Complex Zeros 
CONJUGATE ZEROS THEOREM 
If the polynomial P has real coefficients and if the complex number z is a zero of P. 
Then its complex conjugate z* is also a zero of P. 
 
Example 5 
Find a polynomial P (x) of degree 3 that has integer coefficients and zeros 1/2 and 3-i. 
 
 
 
 
 
1.7.5 Linear and Quadratic Factors 
LINEAR AND QUADRATIC FACTORS THEOREM 
Every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into a product of linear and 
irreducible quadratic factors with real coefficients. 
 
Example 6 
Let P(x) = x4 +2x2 -8. 
(a) Factor P into linear and irreducible quadratic factors with real coefficients. 
(b) Factor P completely into linear factors with complex coefficients.
