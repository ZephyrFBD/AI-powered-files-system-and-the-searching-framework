Figure 2. Membrane potential during an 
 action potential 
in permeability of the membrane to sodium ions (Na+) and potassium ions (K+) during the action potential.  
The graph in Figure 2 represents the changes in membrane potential during an action potential. 
(a)  Identify ONE difference between the Na+ and K+ permeability curves shown in Figure 1. 
(b)  Describe ONE structural feature of the plasma membrane of the motor neuron that regulates the  
permeability of the plasma membrane to Na+ and K+ during an action potential.  
(c)  Connect the relative membrane permeability data shown in Figure 1 with the changes in membrane 
potential during stages II and III of the action potential shown in Figure 2.
