ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.J
Explain deviations from 
Mendel’s model of the 
inheritance of traits.
IST-1.J.4
Some traits result from non-nuclear 
inheritance—
a. Chloroplasts and mitochondria are randomly 
assorted to gametes and daughter cells; 
thus, traits determined by chloroplast and 
mitochondrial DNA do not follow simple 
Mendelian rules.
b. In animals, mitochondria are transmitted by 
the egg and not by sperm; as such, traits 
determined by the mitochondrial DNA are 
maternally inherited.
c. In plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts 
are transmitted in the ovule and not in the 
pollen; as such, mitochondria-determined 
and chloroplast-determined traits are 
maternally inherited.
