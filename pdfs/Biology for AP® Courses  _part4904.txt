 been mistaken
It’s impossible to say
And the grass is growing
Underneath our feet
The words that I remember
From my childhood still are true
That there’s none so blind
As those who will not see
And to those who lack the courage
And say it’s dangerous to try
Well they just don’t know
That love eternal will not be denied
I know you’re out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you’re out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I’ll ﬁnd you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I’ll ﬁnd you somehow
And somehow I’ll return again to you
The Moody Blues
Are you a gutless wonder - or a Renegade Mind?
Monuments put from pen to paper,
Turns me into a gutless wonder,
And if you tolerate this,
Then your children will be next.
Gravity keeps my head down,
Or is it maybe shame ...
Manic Street Preachers
 
Rise like lions aĞer slumber
In unvanquishable number.
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep have fallen on you.
Ye are many – they are few.
Percy Shelley
