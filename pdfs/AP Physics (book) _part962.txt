Columns that support a weight, such as the columns of a Greek temple (Fig. 9–21),
are subjected to compressive stress. Equations 9–4 and 9–5 apply equally well to
compression and tension, and the values for the modulus E are usually the same.

Figure 9–22 compares tensile and compressive stresses as well as the third type,
shear stress. An object under shear stress has equal and opposite forces applied
across its opposite faces. A simple example is a book or brick firmly attached to a
tabletop, on which a force is exerted parallel to the top surface. The table exerts an
equal and opposite force along the bottom surface. Although the dimensions of the
object do not change significantly, the shape of the object does change, Fig. 9–22c.
An equation similar to Eq. 9–4 can be applied to calculate shear strain:
