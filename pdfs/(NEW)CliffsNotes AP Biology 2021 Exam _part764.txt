) of the cells should reveal that “cells” with the larger'S/V will have a larger
portion of their volume penetrated by diffusion (turned red) of the NaOH in a fixed amount of time. Since the
plasma membrane is the surface through which substances must pass (going in or out), a smaller cell, with a larger
S/V, is more able to accommodate its metabolic need compared to a larger cell.
If a question on the AP exam asks you to design an experiment to investigate the effect of temperature or
concentration on diffusion, you can apply the procedures of this investigation but at various temperatures or by
using different concentrations of NaOH.
Part II: Diffusion and Osmosis
This part of the investigation examines the influence of solute type and concentration on diffusion and osmosis.
Model cells are represented by bags made with dialysis tubing. The tubing limits the passage of solutes and models a
selectively permeable membrane. It will allow small molecules to pass through, such as water an
