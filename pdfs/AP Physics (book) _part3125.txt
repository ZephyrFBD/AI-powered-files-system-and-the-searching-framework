m mechanics, there is actually a limit to the precision
of certain measurements. This limit is not a restriction on how well instruments
can be made; rather, it is inherent in nature. It is the result of two factors: the
wave–particle duality, and the unavoidable interaction between the thing observed
and the observing instrument. Let us look at this in more detail.
To make a measurement on an object without disturbing it, at least a little, is
not possible. Consider trying to locate a lost Ping-pong ball in a dark room: you
could probe about with your hand or a stick, or you could shine a light and detect
the photons reflecting off the ball. When you search with your hand or a stick,
you find the ball’s position when you touch it, but at the same time you unavoid-
ably bump it, and give it some momentum. Thus you won’t know its future
position. If you search for the Ping-pong ball using light, in order to “see” the ball
at least one photon (really, quite a few) must scatter from it, a
