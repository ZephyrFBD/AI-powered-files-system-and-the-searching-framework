u divide 2.0 by 3.0, the proper answer is 0.67, and
not 0.666666666 as calculators give (Fig. 1–6a). Digits should not be quoted in a
result unless they are truly significant figures. However, to obtain the most
accurate result, you should normally keep one or more extra significant figures
throughout a calculation, and round off only in the final result. (With a calcu-
lator, you can keep all its digits in intermediate results.) Note also that
calculators sometimes give too few significant figures. For example, when you
multiply 
a calculator may give the answer as simply 8. But the answer is
accurate to two significant figures, so the proper answer is 8.0. See Fig. 1–6b.
Significant figures. Using a protractor 
(Fig. 1–7), you measure an angle to be 30°. (a) How many significant figures
should you quote in this measurement? (b) Use a calculator to find the cosine
of the angle you measured.
RESPONSE (a) If you look at a protractor, you will see that the precision
