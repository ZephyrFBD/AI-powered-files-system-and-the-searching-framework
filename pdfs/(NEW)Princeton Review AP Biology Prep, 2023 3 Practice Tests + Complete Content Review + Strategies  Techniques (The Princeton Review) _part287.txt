somes. The duplicate versions of each chromosome are called homologous chromosomes. The
homologous chromosomes that make up each pair are similar in size and shape and contain the same genes in the
same locations (although they might have different versions of those genes). This is the case in all sexually
reproducing organisms. In fact, this is the essence of sexual reproduction: each parent donates half its chromosomes
to its offspring.
Gametes
Although most cells in the human body are diploid, there are special cells that are haploid. These haploid cells are
called sex cells, or gametes. Why do we have haploid cells?
As weâ€™ve said, an offspring has one set of chromosomes from each of its parents. A parent, therefore, contributes a
gamete with one set that will be paired with the set from the other parent to produce a new diploid cell, or zygote.
This produces offspring that are a combination of their parents.
