Calcium and the elements below it react readily with water at room temperature (al-
though more slowly than the alkali metals adjacent to them in the periodic table). The 
reaction between calcium and water (Figure 7.25), for example, is
 
Ca1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ Ca1OH221aq2 + H21g2

Because of concerns of the Food and Drug Administration, 
lithium was removed from 7UP® during the early 1950s. At nearly 
the same time, psychiatrists discovered that lithium ions have a
