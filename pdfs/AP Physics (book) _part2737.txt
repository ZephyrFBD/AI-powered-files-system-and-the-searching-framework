ar apart are the fringes in the center of the pat-
tern on a screen 3.3 m away?
10. (II) A physics professor wants to perform a lecture demon-
stration of Young’s double-slit experiment for her class
using the 633-nm light from a He–Ne laser. Because the
lecture hall is very large, the interference pattern will be
projected on a wall that is 5.0 m from the slits. For easy
viewing by all students in the class, the professor wants the
distance between the 
and 
maxima to be
35 cm. What slit separation is required in order to produce
the desired interference pattern?
11. (II) Suppose a thin piece of glass is placed in front of the
lower slit in Fig. 24–7 so that the two waves enter the slits
180° out of phase (Fig.24–58). Draw in detail the interference
pattern seen on the screen.

16. (II) Light of wavelength 470 nm in air shines on two slits
apart. The slits are immersed in water, as
is a viewing screen 40.0 cm away. How far apart are the
fringes on the screen?
