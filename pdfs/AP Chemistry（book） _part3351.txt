sents the energy lost when the nucleons in a nuclear reaction reorganize into more 
stable arrangements. Often gamma rays are not explicitly shown when writing nuclear 
equations.
Positron Emission and Electron Capture Two other types of radioactive decay are 
positron emission and electron capture. A positron, represented as 
0
+1e, or simply as b+, 
is a particle that has the same mass as an electron (thus, we use the letter e and super-
script 0 for the mass) but the opposite charge (represented by the +1 subscript).*
The isotope carbon-11 decays by positron emission:

6C ยก 11
5B +  0
+1e 
[21.4]
Positron emission causes the atomic number of the reactant in this equation to decrease 
from 6 to 5. In general, positron emission has the effect of converting a proton to a neu-
tron, thereby decreasing the atomic number of the nucleus by 1 while not changing the 
mass number:

0
+1e or p ยก n + b+

Electron capture is the capture by the nucleus of an electron fro
