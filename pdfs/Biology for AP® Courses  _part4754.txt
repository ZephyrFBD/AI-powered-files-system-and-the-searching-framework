the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbalsâ€”books that identified plants and their uses. Humans are not the only
species to use plants for medicinal reasons: the great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have all been
observed self-medicating with plants.
Modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. Examples of significant
medicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine (Figure 38.8). Many
medicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. It is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of
modern drugs contained at least one plant extract. That number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant
ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions. Antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health
and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds larg
