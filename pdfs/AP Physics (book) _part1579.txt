 give off 185 kcal of heat
in 25 min by evaporation of water (at 20°C) from the skin.
How much water has been lost? [Hint: See page 399.]
27. (II) What mass of steam at 100°C must be added to 1.00 kg
of ice at 0°C to yield liquid water at 30°C?
28. (II) A 28-g ice cube at its melting point is dropped into an
insulated container of liquid nitrogen. How much nitrogen
evaporates if it is at its boiling point of 77 K and has a latent
heat of vaporization of 
Assume for simplicity
that the specific heat of ice is a constant and is equal to its
value near its melting point.
29. (II) High-altitude mountain climbers do not eat snow, but
always melt it first with a stove. To see why, calculate the
energy absorbed from your body if you: (a) eat 1.0 kg of
snow which your body warms to body temperature
of 37°C; (b) melt 1.0 kg of 
snow using a stove and
drink the resulting 1.0 kg of water at 2°C, which your body
has to warm to 37°C.
30. (II) An iron boiler of mass 180 kg contains 730 kg of water a
