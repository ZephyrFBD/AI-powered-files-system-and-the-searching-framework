ization energy of a Cl-1g2 
ion and the electron affinity of Cl1g2?
7.6 ∣ Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids
Atomic radii, ionization energies, and electron affinities are properties of individual atoms. 
With the exception of the noble gases, however, none of the elements exist in nature as indi-
vidual atoms. To get a broader understanding of the properties of elements, we must also 
examine periodic trends in properties of samples that involve large collections of atoms.

Metals
Nonmetals
Have a shiny luster; various colors, although most are silvery
Do not have a luster; various colors
Solids are malleable and ductile
Solids are usually brittle; some are hard, and some are soft
Good conductors of heat and electricity
Poor conductors of heat and electricity
Most metal oxides are ionic solids that are basic
Most nonmetal
