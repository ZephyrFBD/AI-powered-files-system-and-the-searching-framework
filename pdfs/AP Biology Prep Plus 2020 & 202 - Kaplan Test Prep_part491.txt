ion. Therefore, if their commensalistic
partner is disappearing, it is unlikely that these forms of reproduction
would help them evolve either to live independently or to find a new
organism to coexist with. (C) and (D) are also incorrect because they
list benefits of asexual reproduction that are most useful during
periods of relative stability.

Summing up the values in the final column, as per the chi-square
formula, yields a value of 46.16, which rounds down to 46. (C) is
correct.
11. D

Mitosis is the process during which a cell replicates and divides. Within
the cell cycle of somatic cells, it occurs aȇer interphase, during which
the cell grows, DNA replicates, and the cell becomes ready to divide.
