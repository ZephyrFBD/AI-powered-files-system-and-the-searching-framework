for protein analysis. The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass
spectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. Advances in spectrometry have allowed
researchers to analyze very small samples of protein. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine the
three-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in aqueous
solution. Protein microarrays have also been used to study interactions between proteins. Large-scale adaptations of the
basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.16) have provided the basis for protein microarrays. Computer software is used to
analyze the
