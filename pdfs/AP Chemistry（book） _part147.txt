s in chemistry is to relate the energy changes seen in the macro-
scopic world to the kinetic or potential energy of substances at the molecular level. 
Many substances, fuels for example, release energy when they react. The chemical 
energy of a fuel is due to the potential energy stored in the arrangements of its atoms. 
As we will learn in later chapters, chemical energy is released when bonds between atoms 
are formed, and consumed when bonds between atoms are broken. When a fuel burns, some 
bonds are broken and others are formed, but the net effect is to convert chemical poten-
tial energy to thermal energy, the energy associated with temperature. The increase in 
thermal energy arises from increased molecular motion and hence increased kinetic 
energy at the molecular level.
High potential energy,
zero kinetic energy
Decreasing potential energy,
increasing kinetic energy
