more than other counties, but they still 
canâ€™t avoid. Only when Haiti owns sustainable society and economy, they can make 
the influences lower. Just like China and Japan, these countries all restored the 
influences bringing from disasters quickly. 
In a brief sum, if additional environmental factors occur, they should make 
society and economy sustainable. Otherwise, they just follow our 20 years plan to do, 
and in the near future, they will reach the index and become a sustainable country. 
 
5. Sensitivity Analysis 
First of all, we set a sensitivity analysis for the weight vector of first level index 
layer and second level index layer. Taking the weight of first level index layer as an 
example, the original weight vector U  is [0.5631 0.2675 0.1694]. Now we consider 
the new weight vector 
'
U
=[0.5531 0.2775 0.1694], then we can get the 
corresponding index. 
Table18: Sensitivity Analysis 
 
U = 0.5631 0.2675 0.1694 
'
U = 0.5531 0.2775 0.1694
