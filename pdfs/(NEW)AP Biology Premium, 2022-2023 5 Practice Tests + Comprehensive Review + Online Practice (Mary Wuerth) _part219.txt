e of this is the fermentation that yeast undergoes as bread
dough rises. As yeast ferments the sugars in the uncooked bread dough, alcohol and carbon dioxide are produced.
The carbon dioxide gas causes the bread dough to “rise,” and the alcohol is evaporated by high temperatures during
the baking of the bread dough.
Figure 9.6 Alcohol Fermentation
In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid (a three-carbon molecule), and NADH is oxidized
to NAD+. No carbon dioxide is produced. Lactic acid fermentation can occur in muscle cells if they do not have
enough oxygen to carry out oxidative phosphorylation.
