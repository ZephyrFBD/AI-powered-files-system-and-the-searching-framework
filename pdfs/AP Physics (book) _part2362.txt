1–10 Inductance
Mutual Inductance
If two coils of wire are near one another, as in Fig. 21–35, a changing current in
one will induce an emf in the other. We apply Faraday’s law to coil 2: the emf 
induced in coil 2 is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux passing
through it. A changing flux in coil 2 is produced by a changing current 
in coil 1.
So 
is proportional to the rate of change of the current in coil 1:
(21;8a)
where we assume the time interval 
is very small, and the constant of propor-
tionality, M, is called the mutual inductance. (The minus sign is because of 
Lenz’s law, the induced emf opposes the changing flux.) Mutual inductance 
has units of
which is called the henry (H), after Joseph Henry:
The mutual inductance M is a “constant” in that it does not depend on 
M depends on “geometri
