Global warming could have disastrous effects for the world’s
population. An increase of 1.0°C on average temperature worldwide would
cause the polar ice caps to melt, raising the level of the seas. As a result,
major coastal cities in the United States, including New York, Los
Angeles, and Miami, would be under water.
Coral reefs like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia are under increased
physiological stress due to an increase in global warming. This stress
makes it more difficult for coral to build their skeletons. Oysters and sea
urchins are also suffering because of increased acidification of the oceans
due to an increase in CO2 dissolved in the oceans.
Acidification of the Oceans
Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere normally dissolves in the oceans by
combining with H2O to form carbonic acid. With increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, the oceans are rapidly becoming
more acidic. The acidification of the oceans also directly results in a
decrease in the co
