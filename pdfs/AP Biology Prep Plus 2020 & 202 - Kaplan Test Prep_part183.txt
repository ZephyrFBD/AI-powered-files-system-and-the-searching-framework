ane consists of hydrophobic fatty
acid tails, amino acids with nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains would
be far more likely to be found there than amino acids with charged
(hydrophilic) side chains. A hydrophobic compound would be more
stable (have a lower free energy) while a hydrophilic compound would
be less stable (have a higher free energy) within a membrane. Thus,
Graph A must correspond to charged amino acid side chains and
Graph B to nonpolar amino acid side chains, making (C) correct. (A) is
incorrect because it reverses the results. (B) and (D) are incorrect
because the length of the side chains is irrelevant; only the polarity of
the side chain matters.

Animal cells do not contain cell walls, but many prokaryotes do
contain such structures. Thus, a drug specifically targeting cell walls
(such as penicillin) would be relatively safe to use in humans.
Therefore, (B) is correct. (A) and (C) are incorrect because only
eukaryotic cells contain organell
