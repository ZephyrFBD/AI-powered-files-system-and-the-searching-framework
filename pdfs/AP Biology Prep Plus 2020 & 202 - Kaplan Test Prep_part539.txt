7. The diagram below shows a DNA plasmid with a total length of
2,000 base pairs. The tick marks indicate cleavage sites for
restriction enzymes (enzyme EcoRI and enzyme HaeIII).
Answers to this quiz can be found at the end of this chapter.
The plasmid was digested with the enzyme HaeIII to completion
and the fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis. Which
of the following results would most likely be observed?
Two fragments measuring 400 bp and 900 bp
(A)
Two fragments measuring 700 bp and 900 bp
(B)
Two fragments measuring 900 bp and 1,100 bp
(C)
Three fragments measuring 400 bp, 700 bp, and 900 bp
(D)
