ery that can hold 16 kWh of
energy (approximately 
). If the battery is designed
to operate at 340 V, how many coulombs of charge would
need to leave the battery at 340 V and return at 0 V to equal
the stored energy of the battery?
32. (I) An electric car uses a 45-kW (160-hp) motor. If the bat-
tery pack is designed for 340 V, what current would the motor
need to draw from the battery? Neglect any energy losses
in getting energy from the battery to the motor.
33. (II) A 120-V hair dryer has two settings: 950 W and 1450 W.
(a) At which setting do you guess the resistance to be higher?
After making a guess, determine the resistance at (b) the
lower setting, and (c) the higher setting.
34. (II) A 12-V battery causes a current of 0.60 A through a
resistor. (a) What is its resistance, and (b) how many joules
of energy does the battery lose in a minute?
35. (II) A 120-V fish-tank heater is rated at 130 W. Calculate
(a) the current through the heater when it is operating, and
(b) its resista
