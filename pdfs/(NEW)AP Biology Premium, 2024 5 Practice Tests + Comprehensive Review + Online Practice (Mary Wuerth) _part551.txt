 an area and the number of members of each of those species in
the area. Species diversity gives a more accurate assessment of the variety of organisms found in an area. One way
of representing species diversity is the equation for Simpson’s Diversity Index:
where n = the total number of organisms of a particular species and N = the total number of organisms of all the
species. The higher Simpson’s Diversity Index, the more diverse the community.
Practice with Simpson’s Diversity Index
The equation for Simpson’s Diversity Index can be used to compare the diversity of two communities, as in the
following example.
Community A is in a suburban backyard, and Community B is in a forest. The species composition and the
number of organisms of each species in each community are shown in the following tables.
Community A
Species
Number of Organisms
Grass
11,000
Camellia Shrubs

Elm Tree

Total Number of Organisms
11,005
Community B
