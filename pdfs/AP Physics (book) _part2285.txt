76. The magnetic field B at the center of a circular coil of wire
carrying a current I (as in Fig. 20–9) is
where N is the number of loops in the coil and r is its radius.
Imagine a simple model in which the Earth’s magnetic
field of about 1 G 
near the poles is produced
by a single current loop around the equator. Roughly
estimate the current this loop would carry.
77. A proton follows a spiral path through a gas in a uniform
magnetic field of 0.010 T, perpendicular to the plane of 
the spiral, as shown in Fig. 20–66. In two successive loops,
at points P and Q, the radii are
10.0 mm and 8.5 mm, respectively.
Calculate the change in the kinetic
energy of the proton as it travels
from P to Q.
