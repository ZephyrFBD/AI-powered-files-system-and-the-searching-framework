photograph. Solutions, however, can also be 
solids or gases. For example, sterling silver is a homogeneous mixture of 
about 7% copper in silver and so is a solid solution. The air we breathe is 
a homogeneous mixture of several gases, making air a gaseous solution. 
However, because liquid solutions are the most common, we focus our 
attention on them in this chapter.
Each substance in a solution is a component of the solution. As we 
saw in Chapter 4, the solvent is normally the component present in the 
greatest amount, and all the other components are called solutes. In this 
chapter, we compare the physical properties of solutions with the prop-
erties of the components in their pure form. We will be particularly con-
cerned with aqueous solutions, which contain water as the solvent and 
either a gas, liquid, or solid as a solute.

In Chapters 10, 11, and 12, we 
explored the properties of pure gases, liquids, and 
solids. However, the matter that we encounter in 
our daily li
