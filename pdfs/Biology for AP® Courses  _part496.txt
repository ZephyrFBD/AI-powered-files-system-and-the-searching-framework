oles are storage and transport
compartments. In plant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.
Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The centrosome has two bodies perpendicular to each other, the
centrioles, and has an unknown purpose in cell division. Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells.
Plant cells and plant-like cells each have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose
primary component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis
takes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole can expand without having to produce more cytoplasm.
4.4 The Endomembrane System and Proteins
The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, the ER, and Golgi apparatus, as well as the
plasma membrane. These cellular components work together to modify, package, tag, and transport proteins and lipids that
form the membranes.
The RER modifies p
