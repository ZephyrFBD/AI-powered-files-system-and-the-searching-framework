Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon
Cells of the body require nutrients in order to function, and these nutrients are obtained through feeding. In order to manage
nutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy
stores. Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels
rise (for example, after a meal is consumed). Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and
utilization by target cells, which use glucose for ATP production. It also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen,
which is then stored by cells for later use. Insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and
