ysis is basically the same as for a transmission grating, which
we now discuss.
The analysis of a diffraction grating is much like that of Young’s double-slit
experiment. We assume parallel rays of light are incident on the grating as shown
in Fig. 24–24. We also assume that the slits are narrow enough so that diffraction
by each of them spreads light over a very wide angle on a distant screen beyond
the grating, and interference can occur with light from all the other slits. Light rays
that pass through each slit without deviation 
interfere constructively 
to produce a bright maximum at the center of the screen. Constructive interfer-
ence also occurs at an angle 
such that rays from adjacent slits travel an extra
distance of 
where m is an integer. If d is the distance between slits,
then we see from Fig. 24–24 that 
and
(24;4)
is the criterion to have a brightness maximum. This is the same equation as for
the double-slit situation, and again m is called the order of the pattern.
