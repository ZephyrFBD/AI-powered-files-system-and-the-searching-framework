nimals that does not have exactly the same genes. These two
chromosomes, the X and Y chromosomes, are called the sex chromosomes. All other chromosomes are called
autosomes. In mammals and fruit flies, inheritance of two X chromosomes (XX) produces a female and inheritance
of one X and one Y (XY) produces a male.
Although inheritance of a Y chromosome makes a male, the Y chromosome is small (compared to the X) and has
relatively few genes. Some of its genes code for testes and sperm development. One gene in particular, the SRY
(Sex-determining Region of Y), regulates gene activities on other chromosomes, which, in turn, stimulate
development of male characteristics. As a result, many traits that distinguish the sexes (milk production, male
pattern baldness) are sex limited, that is, they can only develop in one or the other sex, even though the genes for
those traits are on autosomes.
Sex-linked (or X-linked) genes are genes that reside on the X, or sex, chromosome. Y-linked genes are
