certain cells convert pyruvate from glycolysis into ethyl alcohol and
carbon dioxide in the absence of oxygen and, in the process, oxidize
NADH back to NAD+. The bread-baking industry depends on the ability of
yeast to carry out fermentation and produce carbon dioxide, which causes
bread to rise. The beer, liquor, and wine industry depends on yeast to
ferment sugar into ethyl alcohol.
Lactic Acid Fermentation
During lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate from glycolysis is reduced to
form lactic acid or lactate. This is the process that the dairy industry uses
to produce yogurt and cheese. Also in the process, NADH gets oxidized
back to NAD+. Human skeletal muscles also carry out lactic acid
fermentation when the blood cannot supply adequate oxygen to muscles
during strenuous exercise. Lactic acid in the muscle causes fatigue and
burning. The lactic acid continues to build up until the blood can supply
the muscles with adequate oxygen to
