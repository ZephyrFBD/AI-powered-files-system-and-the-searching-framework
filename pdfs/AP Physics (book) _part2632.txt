ause normal openings and obstacles are much larger
than the wavelength of the light, and so relatively little diffraction or bending
occurs.

24–2 Huygens’ Principle and the
Law of Refraction
The laws of reflection and refraction were well known in Newton’s time. The law
of reflection could not distinguish between the two theories we just discussed:
waves versus particles.
