s solute (i.e., watery solution) to where there is more solute (i.e., concentrated
solution). Itâ€™s as if the water is moving to dilute the concentrated solute particles.
Often, situations discussing osmosis set it up so that there are two areas and the water can flow freely, but the solute
cannot. For example, if a chamber containing water and a chamber containing a sucrose solution are connected by a
semipermeable membrane that allows water but not sucrose to cross, diffusion of sucrose between the chambers
cannot occur. In this case, osmosis draws water into the sucrose chamber to reduce the sucrose concentration. This
will reduce the total volume of the water chamber. Water will flow into the sucrose chamber until the concentration
is the same across the membrane.
In both diffusion and osmosis, the final result is that solute concentrations are the same on both sides of the
membrane. The only difference is that in diffusion the membrane is usually permeable to solute, and in osmosis
