ots with a single extension deep into the
soil, while other plants have highly branched roots. Cells on the surface of
roots oȇen have long extensions called root hairs, which  increase the
surface area of roots. Some plants without root hairs have a symbiotic
relationship with fungi that increase the surface area of the root to
absorb water and minerals. In legumes, nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium species
of bacteria infect roots and form root nodules in symbiosis with the plant.
The roots of plants oȇen play an important role in preventing erosion.
Tropical rain forest that is cleared is highly vulnerable to erosion of the
thin soil if the plants and their root systems are absent.

Leaves can have a variety of shapes. Monocot leaves are usually very
narrow with veins that run parallel to the length of the leaf, while dicot
leaves are broad with veins that are arranged in a net in the leaf. Modified
