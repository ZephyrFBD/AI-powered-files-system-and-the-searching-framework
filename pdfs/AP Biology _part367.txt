A researcher was studying genetic traits in bacteria. He used two
strains of the bacterium S. pneumoniae. X-strain is a pathogen that is

known to cause pneumonia in mice because it has an outer capsule
that protects it from the mouseâ€™s immune system. Y-strain lacks the
gene for the protective capsule and does not cause pneumonia in
mice. To confirm this, the researcher injected two different mice
with the two different strains of bacteria. The mouse that was
injected with X-strain grew sick and died. The other mouse, who
was injected with Y-strain, remained healthy.
