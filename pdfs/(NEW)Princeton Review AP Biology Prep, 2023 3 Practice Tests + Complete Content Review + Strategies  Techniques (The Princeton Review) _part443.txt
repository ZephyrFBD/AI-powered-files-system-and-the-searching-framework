Ospreys are aquatic birds of prey whose diet consists primarily of fish. The fish that ospreys consumed had, in turn,
been feeding on contaminated insects (bioaccumulation). Because fish eat thousands of insects, and ospreys
hundreds of fish, the toxins grew increasingly concentrated (biomagnification). Though the insecticide seemed
harmless enough, it resulted in the near extinction of certain osprey populations. What no one knew was that in
sufficient concentrations, DDT weakened the eggshells of ospreys. Consequently, eggs broke before they could
hatch, killing the unborn ospreys.
Ecosystem Interconnectedness
Because all levels of an ecosystem are closely connected, a disruption in one
level due to environmental changes, for example, affects all other aspects of
that ecosystem.
Such environmental tragedies still occur. All ecosystems, small or great, are intricately woven, and any change in
one level
