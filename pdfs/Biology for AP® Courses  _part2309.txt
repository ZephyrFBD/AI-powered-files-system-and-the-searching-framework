r information is more effective in
determining phylogeny.
38. Describe what maximum parsimony is used for in
evolutionary biology.
a.
Maximum parsimony hypothesizes that
organisms that share the most traits are the most
likely to share a common ancestor.
b.
Maximum parsimony hypothesizes that
organisms that share a common ancestor are
more likely to have many traits in common.
c.
Maximum parsimony hypothesizes that events
occurred in the simplest, most obvious way, and
the pathway of evolution probably includes the
fewest major events that coincide with the
evidence at hand.
d.
Maximum parsimony hypothesizes that
organisms that display homologous structures
are closely related, while organisms that display
analogous structures must have diverged much
farther in the past.
39. The emu in Australia and ostrich in Africa are
flightless birds that look similar. One proposed hypothesis
was the birds descend from an early common ancestor that
spread when the continents were connected. DNA ana
