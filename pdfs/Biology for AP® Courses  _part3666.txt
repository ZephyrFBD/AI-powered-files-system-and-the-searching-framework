glucose resources.
B. Describe the connection of a changing environment to
changing genomes in both species in terms of the adaptive
advantage provided and the likelihood that an AMPK
signaling process has been conserved across domains.
Studies of a genetic adaptation in Tibetan population have
shown that other mutations have been selected. One
mutation EPAS1 was shown to be correlated with
increased lactic acid concentrations in the blood. Another
mutation, PPARA, was found to be correlated with fatty
acid production, which is typically seen during hibernation

C. Analyze these observations in terms of the regulation of
metabolism due to changes in genetic makeup and
construct an explanation for the divergence of the
homeostatic mechanisms as an adaptation to the
environment.
The Tibetan population is not isolated. However, these
investigations show the near dominance of the mutated
