if I touch 
 
 anything of The Abbot’s he’ll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find 
 
 306 
 
 in the wardrobe is Grandma’s old black woolen dress.You’re not supposed 
 
 to wear your Grandmother’s old dress when she’s dead and you’re 
 
 a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you’re in bed 
 
 under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the 
 
 smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the 
 
 grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to 
 
 St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise 
 
 him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself 
 
 wasn’t too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it 
 
 and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream. 
 
 The worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother’s 
 
 bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls 
 
 on his arse outside South’s pub after a night
