 ambient temperature decreases well below normal body
temperature, the animal must expend energy to cool itself
down.
This question explores energy budgets for two animals. The
following pie chart shows the relative energy budget for the first
animal: a 25 g female mouse.
The mouse lives in a temperate environment, where food is readily
available, but the animal’s small size causes a rapid loss of body
heat. (Basal metabolism is the minimum amount of energy needed to
maintain all vital functions in an organism that is at complete rest.)
The second animal is the 4 kg male Adélie penguin that lives in the
cold Antarctic environment. This penguin is well-insulated against

catch food, incubating eggs laid by his partner, and bringing food to
his chicks.
