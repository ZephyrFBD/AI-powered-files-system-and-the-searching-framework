Magnetic field due to four wires.
Figure 20–25 shows four long parallel wires which carry equal currents into or
out of the page as shown. In which configuration, (a) or (b), is the magnetic field
greater at the center of the square?
RESPONSE It is greater in (a). The arrows illustrate the directions of the field
produced by each wire; check it out, using the right-hand rule to confirm these
results. The net field at the center is the superpos
