ment and storage occurs: as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen (rivers, lakes,
oceans, groundwater, polar ice caps, and glaciers), and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Carbon is found in all organic
macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and
proteins and is critical to human agriculture. Phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acid (along with nitrogen), is one
of the main ingredients in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface
water. Sulfur, critical to the 3â€“D folding of proteins (as in disulfide binding), is released into the atmosphere by the burning
of fossil fuels, such as coal.
The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen
and phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon. Thus, min
