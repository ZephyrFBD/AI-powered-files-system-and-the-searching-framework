e system may be complicated, we may often be satisfied with
knowing the motion of the center of mass. This result also allows us to solve
certain types of problems very easily, as illustrated by the following Example.

FIGURE 7;28 Example 7–14.
A two-stage rocket. A rocket is shot into
the air as shown in Fig. 7–28. At the moment the rocket reaches its highest point,
a horizontal distance d from its starting point, a prearranged explosion separates
it into two parts of equal mass. Part I is stopped in midair by the explosion, and
it falls vertically to Earth. Where does part II
