-sea model, which pictures the metal as an array of metal cations in 
a “sea” of valence electrons (Figure 12.20). The electrons are confined to the metal by 
electrostatic attractions to the cations, and they are uniformly distributed throughout 
the structure. The electrons are mobile, however, and no individual electron is con-
fined to any particular metal ion. When a voltage is applied to a metal wire, the elec-
trons, being negatively charged, flow through the metal toward the positively charged 
end of the wire.
The high thermal conductivity of metals is also accounted for by the presence of 
mobile electrons. The movement of electrons in response to temperature gradients per-
mits ready transfer of kinetic energy throughout the solid.
