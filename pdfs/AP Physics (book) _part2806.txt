copes are reflecting telescopes which use a curved mirror as the objec-
tive, Fig. 25–22. A mirror has only one surface to be ground and can be supported
along its entire surface† (a large lens, supported at its edges, would sag under its
own weight). Often, the eyepiece lens or mirror (see Fig. 25–22) is removed so
that the real image formed by the objective mirror can be recorded directly on
film or on an electronic sensor (CCD or CMOS, Section 25–1).

†Another advantage of mirrors is that they exhibit no chromatic aberration because the light doesn’t
pass through them; and they can be ground into a parabolic shape to correct for spherical aberration
(Section 25–6). The reflecting telescope was first proposed by Newton.
FIGURE 25–22 A concave mirror can be used as the objective of an astronomical telescope. Arrangement (a) is called the
Newtonian focus, and (b) the Cassegrainian focus. Other arrangements are also possible. (c) The 200-inch (mirror diameter)
