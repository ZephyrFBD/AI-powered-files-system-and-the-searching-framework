is 
tetrahedral (four electron domains around the central atom), the 
H  ¬
 O gH bond angle is approximately 109°. Figure 11.13 The 
O atom is the negative end of the polar H2O molecule; the negative 
end of the dipole is attracted to the positive ion. Figure 11.14  
Yes, although not likely. Figure 11.19 Wax is a hydrocarbon that 
cannot form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, coating the inside of tube 
with wax will dramatically decrease the adhesive forces between 
water and the tube and change the shape of the water meniscus to 
an inverted U-shape. Neither wax nor glass can form metallic bonds 
with mercury so the shape of the mercury meniscus will be qualita-
tively the same, an inverted U-shape. Figure 11.20 Because energy 
is a state function, the energy to convert a gas to a solid is the same 
regardless of whether the process occurs in one or two steps. Thus, 
the energy of deposition equals the energy of condensation plus 
the energy of freezing. Figure 11.21 Because water has stro
