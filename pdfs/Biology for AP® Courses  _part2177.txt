dators and less able to escape, is clearly a disadvantage to the birds’ survival. But because it is a
disadvantage, only the most fit males should be able to survive with it. Thus, the tail serves as an honest
signal of quality to the females of the population; therefore, the male will earn more matings and greater
reproductive success.
In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis, the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males’ quality,
thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates— males that will pass the best genes to their offspring.
No Perfect Organism
Natural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to survive and
successfully reproduce in their environments. But natural selection cannot produce the perfect organism. Natural selection
can only select on existing variation in the population; it does not create anything from scratch. Thus, it is limited by a
population’s existing genetic variance an
