use
this galvanometer to make (a) an ammeter to read currents
up to 25 A, and (b) a voltmeter to give a full-scale deflection
of 250 V.
63. (III) A battery with
and internal resistance
is connected to two 
resistors in series. An
ammeter of internal resistance 
measures the current,
and at the same time a voltmeter with internal resistance
measures the voltage across one of the 
resis-
tors in the circuit. What do the ammeter and voltmeter read?
What is the % “error” from the current and voltage without
meters?
64. (III) What internal resistance should the voltmeter of
Example 19–17 have to be in error by less than 5%?
65. (III) Two 
resistors are placed in series and connected
to a battery.A voltmeter of sensitivity 
is on the 3.0-V
scale and reads 1.9 V when placed across either resistor. What
is the emf of the battery? (Ignore its internal resistance.)
66. (III) When the resistor R in Fig. 19–73 is 
the high-
resistance voltmeter reads 9.7 V. When R is replaced by a
resistor, the vo
