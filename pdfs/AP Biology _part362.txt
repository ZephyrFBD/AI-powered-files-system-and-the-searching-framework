that CRISPR-Cas9 could be used for programmable gene editing. Their
work has since been further developed by many research groups for the
treatment of diseases, including sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis,
Huntington’s disease, and HIV. In November 2017, the journal Science
reported the first time CRISPR was used to alter a person’s genome: in an
instance where a person was suffering from a rare metabolic disorder
called Hunter syndrome.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Many people are concerned about potential problems arising from genetic
engineering. This section discusses some of those concerns.
Safety
Much of the milk available in stores comes from cows that have been
given a genetically engineered bovine growth hormone (BGH) to increase
the quantity of milk they produce. Many people are concerned that this
hormone will find its way into the milk and cause problems for the people
who drink it.
Vegetable seeds have been genetically engineered to produce special
characteristics in the vege
