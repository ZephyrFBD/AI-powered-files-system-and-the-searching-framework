minate choice C and choice D because they refer to a
decreasing hatching rate after translocation, which is counter to what
can be seen on the graph. The hatching rate increased because
genetic variation increased as a result of the introduction of a new
population into the area. Since genetic variation must have
increased, not decreased, due to the introduction of a new
population, rule out choice A as well.
(A) These internal structures are homologous, not analogous, and
they reflect a shared ancestry. Choice B is incorrect because it is the
opposite of choice A, which is the correct answer. Choice C is
incorrect because it describes structures that are analogous, like the
streamlined shape of the dolphin (a mammal) and tuna (a fish).
Analogous structures, by definition, do not reveal a common
ancestry. Choice D is incorrect because body parts and systems do
not evolve because they are “needed.”
(D) The question does not reveal anything about mutations or
genetic drift. The point her
