material has zero resistivity when its
temperature is below 
its “critical
temperature.” At temperatures above 
the resistivity jumps to a “normal” nonzero
value and increases with temperature as
most materials do (Eq. 18–4).

18–10 Electrical Conduction in the
Human Nervous System
An interesting example of the flow of electric charge is in the human nervous system,
which provides us with the means for being aware of the world, for communication
within the body, and for controlling the body’s muscles. Although the detailed
functioning of the hugely complex nervous system still is not well understood,
we do have a reasonable understanding of how messages are transmitted within
the nervous system: they are electrical signals passing along the basic element 
of the nervous system, the neuron.
