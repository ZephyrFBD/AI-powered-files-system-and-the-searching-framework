f change of its momentum:
(We have written 
instead of 
for the net force, which we assume is entirely
due to the brief but large average force that acts during the collision.) This equa-
tion applies to each of the two objects in a collision. We multiply both sides of this
equation by the time interval 
and obtain
(7;4)
The quantity on the left, the product of the force 
times the time 
over which
the force acts, is called the impulse:
(7;5)
We see that the total change in momentum is equal to the impulse. The concept
of impulse is useful mainly when dealing with forces that act during a short time
interval, as when a bat hits a baseball. The force is generally not constant, and
often its variation in time is like that graphed in Figs. 7–9 and 7–10. We can often
approximate such a varying force as an average force 
acting during a time
interval 
as indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 7–10.
