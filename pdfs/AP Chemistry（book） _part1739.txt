face area and making the molecules at the surface pack closely together.
Because spheres have the smallest surface area for their volume, water droplets 
assume an almost spherical shape. This explains the tendency of water to “bead up” when 
it contacts a surface made of nonpolar molecules, like a lotus leaf or a newly waxed car.
A measure of the net inward force that must be overcome to expand the surface 
area of a liquid is given by its surface tension. Surface tension is the energy required 
to increase the surface area of a liquid by a unit amount. For example, the surface ten-
sion of water at 20 °C is 7.29 * 10-2 J>m2, which means that an energy of 7.29 * 10-2 J

mercury meniscus change?
