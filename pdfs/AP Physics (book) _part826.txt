–16 is an example. Since we are
assuming the axis remains fixed in direction, either there can be no such forces 
or else the axis must be mounted in bearings or hinges that hold the axis fixed.
Thus, only a force, or component of a force (
in Fig. 8–16), in a plane perpen-
dicular to the axis will give rise to rotational acceleration about the axis.
8–5 Rotational Dynamics;
Torque and Rotational Inertia
We discussed in Section 8–4 that the angular acceleration 
of a rotating object is
proportional to the net torque applied to it:
We write 
to remind us that it is the net torque (sum of all torques acting on 
the object) that is proportional to 
This corresponds to Newton’s second law 
for translational motion,
In the translational case, the acceleration is
not only proportional to the net force, but it is also inversely proportional to the
inertia of the object, which we call its mass, m. Thus we wrote 
. But
what plays the role of mass for the rotational case? That is what we now set
