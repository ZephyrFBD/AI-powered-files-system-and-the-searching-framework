 14.19 Consider the following hypothetical aqueous reaction: 
A1aq2 S B1aq2. A flask is charged with 0.065 mol of A 
in a total volume of 100.0 mL. The following data are 
collected:

 (a) Calculate the number of moles of B at each time in 
the table, assuming that there are no molecules of B at 
time zero and that A cleanly converts to B with no inter-
mediates. (b) Calculate the average rate of disappearance 
of A for each 10-min interval in units of M>s. (c) Between 
t = 10 min and t = 30 min, what is the average rate of 
appearance of B in units of M>s? Assume that the volume 
of the solution is constant.
