the progress curve 
has constant slope, the slope is actually 0. Obviously, flatness in a rate curve and flatness 
in a progress curve mean different things. Flatness in the progress curve for a reaction 
means that the reaction has stopped; flatness in the rate curve means that the reaction is 
going on at a constant rate. You can see, then, that we have to be able to glance at a graph 
and tell whether it is a rate curve or a progress curve in order to be able to interpret what 
the shape of the curve is trying to tell us. 
Now let us take one more example of this kind of rate curve. The graph in Figure A.16 
shows the progress in the growth of a pea plant. First, we can see that the slope is not the 
same everywhere. In fact, there is an interval where the slope increases very gradually 
from 0. By 1 week or so the slope has reached its maximum value and is steady until 
about 3 weeks. Thereafter, the slope begins to decrease again, as the curve bends over, 
and eventually, at about
