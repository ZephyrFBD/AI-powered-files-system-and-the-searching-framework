eft side of the other, and the
right sides are likewise perpendicular (Fig.A–3).
2. The sum of the angles in any plane triangle is 180°.
3. Similar triangles. Two triangles are said to be similar if all three of their
angles are equal (in Fig. A–4,
and 
). Similar 
triangles thus have the same basic shape but may be different sizes and 
have different orientations. Two useful theorems about similar triangles are:
(a) Two triangles are similar if any two of their angles are equal. (This
follows because the third angles must also be equal since the sum of the
angles of a triangle is 180°.)
(b) The ratios of corresponding sides of two similar triangles are equal. That
is (Fig.A–4),
4. Congruent triangles. Two triangles are congruent if one can be placed
precisely on top of the other. That is, they are similar triangles and they have
the same size. Two triangles are congruent if any of the following holds:
(a) The three corresponding sides are equal.
(b) Two sides and the enclosed angle ar
