flask filled 
with gas and the mass of the evacuated flask:
137.456 g - 134.567 g = 2.889 g
Knowing the mass of the gas (2.889 g) and its volume (0.936 L), we 
can calculate the density of the gas:
d = 2.889 g>0.936 L = 3.09 g>L
After converting pressure to atmospheres and temperature to  
kelvins, we can use Equation 10.11 to calculate the molar mass:
 
ℳ= dRT
P
 
 =
13.09 g>L210.08206 L@atm>mol@K21304 K2
10.967 atm2
 
 = 79.7 g>mol
Check The units work out appropriately, and the value of molar 
mass obtained is reasonable for a substance that is gaseous near 
room temperature.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the molar mass of an unknown hydrocarbon whose 
density is measured to be 1.97 g/L at STP?  
(a) 4.04 g/mol (b) 30.7 g/mol (c) 44.1 g/mol  
(d) 48.2 g/mol
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the average molar mass of dry air if it has a density 
of 1.17 g>L at 21 °C and 740.0 torr.
