ll as some larger organic molecules such as amino acids or glucose.
5. Countercurrent exchange describes the diffusion of substances between two regions in which substances are
moving by bulk flow in opposite directions. For example, the direction of water flow through the gills of a fish is
opposite to the flow of blood in the blood vessels. Diffusion of oxygen from water to blood is maximized because
the relative motion of the molecules between the two regions is increased and because the concentration gradients
between the two regions remain constant along their area of contact.
Active transport is the movement of solutes against a gradient and requires the expenditure of energy (usually in
the form of ATP). Transport
 
proteins in the plasma membrane transfer solutes such as small ions (Na+, K+, Clâˆ’, H+), amino acids, and
monosaccharides across the membrane.
Active transport differs from facilitated diffusion in several ways. First, active transport does not result from random
