Think About It
How would a scientist introduce a gene for herbicide resistance into a plant, such as corn?
Cellular Cloning
Unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by
binary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an
exact replica of the genetic material.
Reproductive Cloning
Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most
multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals
(parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in
biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.
Parthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without
