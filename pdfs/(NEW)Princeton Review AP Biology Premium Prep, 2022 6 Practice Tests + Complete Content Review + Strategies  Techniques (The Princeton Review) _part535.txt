 bonds, (C), occurs during translation, not afterward.
6.
B
If 21 nucleotides compose a sequence and 3 nucleotides compose each codon, there would be 7 codons
and thus a maximum of 7 amino acids.
7.
A
Choice (B) is incorrect because bacteria make membrane proteins that reside on the plasma membrane.
Choice (C) is also incorrect because bacteria use transcription factors. Choice (D) is possible, but (A) is
the best answer.
8.
C
Choice (A) is likely incorrect. Choice (B) would be deleterious for the cell. Choice (D) is also incorrect,
as DNA replication occurs only during or preceding binary fission.
9.
B
Viruses do not have their own ribosomes, flagella, or independent metabolism, so (A), (C), and (D) are
incorrect. The only possible answer is (B).
10.
C
Transformation occurs when bacteria take up DNA from their surroundings. The pathogenic bacteria did
not come alive again, as suggested by (A). Protein was not the transforming agent, so (B) is incorrect.
Finally, (D) does not make sens
