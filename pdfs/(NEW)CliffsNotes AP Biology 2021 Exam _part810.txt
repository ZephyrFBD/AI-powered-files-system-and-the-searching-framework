(kPa/min) by the leaf
 
surface area to obtain kPa/cm2/min.
5. Analyze data. Graph your data together with the data of other students (if available) who have investigated the
effect of other environmental variables. One way to prepare the graph is to plot accumulated water loss as a function
of time. Once you have a visual display of the effects of different environmental variables, explain the results
applying what you know about how plant habitat, stomatal density, and how other plant adaptations influence
transpiration rate.
Investigation 12: Animal Behavior
In this lab, you investigate the behavior of fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster) in response to various
environmental stimuli. Alternative subjects for observation include pill bugs (Armadillidium, terrestrial crustaceans)
and brine shrimp (Artemia, aquatic crustaceans). Refer to Chapter 15, “Animal Behavior,” for a complete review of
the various kinds of behavior.
Before working with fruit flies, you should familiarize yours
