on Section I (the multiple-choice section), and the
other 50% of your total score is based on your performance on Section II (the free-response section). For this reason,
it is very important to practice answering all question types (multiple-choice, short free-response, and long free-

Suggested Study Plans
The following are suggested study plans depending on how much time is left until test day. If there’s a lot of time
left before the exam, read through all of the chapters in this book, answer all of the practice questions, and complete
all the practice tests. If time is limited, refer to these study plans to skip to the areas that you may want to study
further. Follow what works best for you and your schedule. Remember, by reviewing and practicing with this book,
you are already taking the first step toward achieving success on the AP Biology exam!
