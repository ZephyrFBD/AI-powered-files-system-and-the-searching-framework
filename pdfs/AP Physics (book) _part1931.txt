(II) A parallel-plate capacitor has fixed charges 
and 
The separation of the plates is then halved. (a) By what
factor does the energy stored in the electric field change?
(b) How much work must be done to reduce the plate sepa-
ration from d to
The area of each plate is A.
57. (II) There is an electric field near the Earth’s surface whose
magnitude is about 150
How much energy is stored
per cubic meter in this field?
58. (III) A 
capacitor is charged by a 12.0-V battery. It
is disconnected from the battery and then connected to an
uncharged 
capacitor (Fig.17–43). Determine the total
stored energy (a) before the two capacitors are connected, and
(b) after they are connected. (c) What is the change in energy?
