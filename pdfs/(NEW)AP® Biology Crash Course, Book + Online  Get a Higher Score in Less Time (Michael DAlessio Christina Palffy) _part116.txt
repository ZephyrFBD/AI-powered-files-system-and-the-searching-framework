 Inversion—occurs if the broken portion of the chromosome may also be inverted and reattached to
the same chromosome.
iv. Translocation—occurs if a portion of the chromosome is moved from one chromosome to a
chromosome that is not its homologue.
2. Mutations in chromosome number—involve the loss or gain of whole chromosomes, or duplication of
whole genomes (all of an organism’s chromosomes).
i.
Nondisjunction—the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis—can result in
the production of cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes.
Nondisjunction can occur during meiosis I or meiosis II. When nondisjunction occurs during
meiosis I, a complete tetrad of one pair of homologous chromosomes moves to one side of the
cell. When nondisjunction occurs during meiosis II, a pair of sister chromatids fails to
separate, pulling both chromatids to one side of the cell.
Regardless of whether nondisjunction occurs during meiosis I or meiosis II, the result is that
some gametes are missi
