how many moles of each product can be obtained starting 
with 4.0 mol CH4. [Section 3.6]
 
3.7 Nitrogen 1N22 and hydrogen 1H22 react to form ammonia 
1NH32. Consider the mixture of N2 and H2 shown in the 
 
accompanying diagram. The blue spheres represent N, and 
the white ones represent H. (a) Write the balanced chemical 
equation for the reaction. (b) What is the limiting reactant? 
(c) How many molecules of ammonia can be made, assum-
ing the reaction goes to completion, based on the diagram? 
 
(d) Are any reactant molecules left over, based on the diagram? 
If so, how many of which type are left over? [Section 3.7]
