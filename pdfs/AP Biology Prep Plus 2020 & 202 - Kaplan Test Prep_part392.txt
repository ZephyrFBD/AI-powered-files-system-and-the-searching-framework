thetic proteins to split water molecules (H2O). Once the water
molecules have been split, the oxygen atoms are immediately released as
O2 and the hydrogen (H) atoms donate their electrons, which are used to
form ATP and NADPH. The H atoms combine with the C and O atoms from
CO2 to form carbohydrates and more water. Sugars are used for energy
storage, and O2 is a waste product that other organisms use for
respiration.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Photosynthetic organisms are primary producers, providing food
that supplies the rest of the food web. This “food” starts out in the
form of glucose.
Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light (or light-dependent)
reactions and the dark (or Calvin or light-independent) reactions. In the
light reactions, light energy is harnessed to produce chemical energy in
the form of ATP and NADPH in a process called photophosphorylation.
The dark reactions complete carbon fixation, the process by which CO2
from the environment is incorporated into sugars with th
