Scientists carried out a series of experiments to study innate
immunity in fruit flies. They began with a mutant fly strain in which
a pathogen is recognized, but the signaling that would normally
trigger an innate response is blocked. As a result, the flies did not
make any antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The scientists then
genetically engineered some of the mutant flies to express
significant amounts of a single AMP, either defensin or drosomycin.
They then infected the flies with a fungus, Neu
