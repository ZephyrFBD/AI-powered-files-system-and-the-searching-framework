types of 
plants. This can be done by measuring/calculating the change in weight, change in 
length, or change in volume. The laboratory should be set up on one day and measured 
the next day. 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Ask students how they could measure water potential in plant cells. This can be done 
by measuring/calculating change in mass, change in length, or change in volume over 
time in plant sections from potatoes. You will prepare several solutions with different 
concentrations of sucrose; however, you will color-code the solutions with food coloring 
instead of labeling the concentrations for students. Students design an experiment 
to identify the concentrations of the sucrose solutions and then use the solutions to 
determine the water potential of the plant tissues. 
Students should set up their investigations in one period (45–60 minutes) and 
conduct them the next day. Waiting too long causes the potato cores to become mushy.
