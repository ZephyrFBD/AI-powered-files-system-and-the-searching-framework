onpolar) end. These compounds emulsify the fats in 
the intestine and thus permit digestion and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins through 
the intestinal wall. The term emulsify means “to form an emulsion,” a suspension of one 
liquid in another, with milk being one example (Table 13.5). A substance that aids in the 
formation of an emulsion is called an emulsifying agent. If you read the labels on foods 
and other materials, you will find that a variety of chemicals are used as emulsifying 
agents. These chemicals typically have a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end.
