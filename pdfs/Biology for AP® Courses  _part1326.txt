oduct or changing its distribution in the body. One example of this is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila
(Figure 12.9). In this case, the mutant allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the Antennapedia
heterozygote develops legs on its head where its antennae should be.
Figure 12.9 As seen in comparing the wild-type Drosophila (left) and the Antennapedia mutant (right), the
Antennapedia mutant has legs on its head in place of antennae.

Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite
Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including
Anopheles gambiae (Figure 12.10a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms,
and severe anemia. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are the most common causative agents of malaria,
and P. falciparum is the most deadly (Figure 12.10b). When promptly and correctly treated, P. falc
