re of 
primary productivity and biomass than is the mass of living plants (containing water). 
What percentage of the living plants is biomass? (Use this calculation in Analyzing and 
Evaluating Results, Step 4.) 
Step 6 Now reconstruct your energy flow diagram with actual data that you have collected 
in your notebook. Be sure to include an explanation, supported by evidence, as to why 
you feel your diagram represents energy flow in Fast Plants. Your explanation should 
also include a description of the uncertainties of your data and your conclusions; put 
boundaries on your conclusions (as you would insert error bars). 
Estimating Energy Flow Between Fast Plants Producers 
and Cabbage Butterfly Larvae 
Donâ€™t forget to think of and record questions about these organisms and the system as 
you work through your investigation. 
Step 1 Cabbage white butterfly larvae eat plants from the cabbage family. As with Fast 
Plants, accounting for energy flow into and out of these butterflies can
