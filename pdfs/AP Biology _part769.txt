The Human Female Reproductive System
The ovaries are where meiosis occurs.
The oviducts or fallopian tubes are where fertilization occurs.
After ovulation, the egg moves through the oviduct to the uterus.
The uterus is where the blastocyst will implant and where the
embryo will develop during the nine-month gestation if
fertilization occurs.
The endometrium is the lining of the uterus that thickens monthly
in preparation for implantation of the blastocyst.
The vagina is the birth canal. During labor and delivery, the baby
passes through the cervix (the mouth of the uterus) and into the
vagina.
