ll prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows
them to survive in both hyper- and hypo-osmotic conditions. Some soil bacteria are able to form endospores that resist
heat and drought, thereby allowing the organism to survive until favorable conditions recur. These adaptations, along with
others, allow bacteria to be the most abundant life form in all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
Other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles, meaning “lovers of
extremes.” Extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments: the depth of the oceans, hot springs, the Artic and
the Antarctic, in very dry places, deep inside Earth, in harsh chemical environments, and in high radiation environments
(Figure 22.5), just to mention a few. These organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up
the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic dr
