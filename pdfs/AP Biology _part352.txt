nown as “jumping genes”). Similar to RNAi, they protect
germ line cells from attacks by transposons.
Proteins Are Modified at the Post-Translation Level
The final opportunity for controlling gene expression occurs following
translation. After emerging from a ribosome, a newly made protein may
spontaneously fold into its correct shape and begin “working”
immediately. On the other hand, some newly made proteins must be
activated before they can begin to function. One example is insulin, which
is released from a ribosome in an inactive form, and only becomes an
active hormone after being cleaved by an enzyme.

RECOMBINANT DNA; CLONING GENES
Recombinant DNA means taking DNA from two or more sources and
combining them into one molecule. This occurs in nature through viral
transduction, bacterial transformation, and conjugation and when
transposons or “jumping genes” move around the genome. Scientists can
also manipulate and engineer
