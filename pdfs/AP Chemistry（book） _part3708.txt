The cis isomer of 3Co(en)2Cl24+ and its mirror image are shown 
here.  In this case the two cannot be superimposed on each other. 
Thus, the two cis structures are optical isomers (enantiomers). We 
say that cis-3Co(en)2Cl24+ is a chiral complex.

When a substance with optical isomers is prepared in the laboratory, the chemical envi-
ronment during the synthesis is not usually chiral. Consequently, equal amounts of the two 
isomers are obtained, and the mixture is said to be racemic. A racemic mixture does not 
rotate polarized light because the rotatory effects of the two isomers cancel eac
