firmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical.

Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant
with white flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of the
F1 hybrid generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be
pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental
traits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendelâ€™s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the F1
generation had completely disappeared.
Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F1 plants to self-fertilize and found that, of
F2-generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of
