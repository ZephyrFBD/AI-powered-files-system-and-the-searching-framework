ineteenth century were aware that atoms of different elements have 
different masses. They found, for example, that each 100.0 g of water contains 11.1 g 
of hydrogen and 88.9 g of oxygen. Thus, water contains 88.9>11.1 = 8 times as much 
oxygen, by mass, as hydrogen. Once scientists understood that water contains two hy-
drogen atoms for each oxygen atom, they concluded that an oxygen atom must have 
2 * 8 = 16 times as much mass as a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen, the lightest atom, was 
arbitrarily assigned a relative mass of 1 (no units). Atomic masses of other elements were 
at first determined relative to this value. Thus, oxygen was assigned an atomic mass of 16.
Today we can determine the masses of individual atoms with a high degree of 
accuracy. For example, we know that the 1H atom has a mass of 1.6735 * 10-24 g and 
the 16O atom has a mass of 2.6560 * 10-23 g. As we noted in Section 2.3, it is conve-
nient to use the atomic mass unit when dealing with these extremely small masses
