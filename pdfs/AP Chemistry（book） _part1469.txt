e in the presence and absence of a mag-
netic field. A paramagnetic substance appears to weigh more in the magnetic field; a 
diamagnetic substance appears to weigh less. The magnetic behaviors observed for the 
period 2 diatomic molecules agree with the electron configurations shown in Figure 9.43.
Electron configurations in molecules can also be related to bond distances and bond 
enthalpies. 
 (Sections 5.8 and 8.8) As bond order increases, bond distances decrease 
and bond enthalpies increase. N2, for example, whose bond order is 3, has a short bond 
distance and a large bond enthalpy. The N2 molecule does not react readily with other
