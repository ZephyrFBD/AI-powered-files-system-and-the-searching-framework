 
provides kinetic energy sufficient to disrupt alignment in another 
dimension, producing a nematic phase with one-dimensional order. 
11.73 (a) Decrease (b) increase (c) increase (d) increase (e) increase  
(f) increase (g) increase 11.76 (a) The cis isomer has stronger dipole-
dipole forces; the trans isomer is nonpolar. (b) The cis isomer boils at 
60.3 °C and the trans isomer boils at 47.5 °C. 11.78 (a) Four, all of 
them (b) three, benzene is nonpolar (c) one, phenol (d) Bromine is 
larger and more polarizable than chlorine, so the dispersion forces in 
bromobenzene are stronger than those in chlorobenzene and bromo-
benzene has the higher boiling point. (e) Phenol exhibits hydrogen 
bonding, which is the strongest intermolecular interaction among 
covalent molecules. 11.81 A plot of number of carbon atoms versus 
boiling point indicates that the boiling point of C8H18 is approxi-
mately 130 °C. The more carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon, the lon-
ger the chain, the more polarizabl
