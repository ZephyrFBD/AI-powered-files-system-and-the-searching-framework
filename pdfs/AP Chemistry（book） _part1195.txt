elements?
 [7.80]  Figure 7.4 shows the radial probability distribution func-
tions for the 2s orbitals and 2p orbitals. (a) Which orbital, 
2s or 2p, has more electron density close to the nucleus? 
(b) How would you modify Slater’s rules to adjust for the 
difference in electronic penetration of the nucleus for the 
2s and 2p orbitals?
 7.81  (a) If the core electrons were totally effective at screening 
the valence electrons and the valence electrons provided 
no screening for each other, what would be the effective 
nuclear charge acting on the 3s and 3p valence electrons 
in P? (b) Repeat these calculations using Slater’s rules. (c) 
Detailed calculations indicate that the effective nucle-
ar charge is 5.6+ for the 3s electrons and 4.9+ for the 3p 
electrons. Why are the values for the 3s and 3p electrons 
different? (d) If you remove a single electron from a P atom, 
which orbital will it come from?
