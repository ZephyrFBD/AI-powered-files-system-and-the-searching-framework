 processes, ATP is
continuously broken down into ADP, and like a rechargeable battery, ADP is continuously regenerated into ATP by the
reattachment of a third phosphate group. Water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group during
ATP hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the ADP molecule, reforming ATP.
Obviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate ATP. Where does this energy come from? In nearly every
living thing on earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose. In this way, ATP is a direct link between the limited
set of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells.
Phosphorylation
Recall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme,
