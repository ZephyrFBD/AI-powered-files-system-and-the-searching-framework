 two daughter cells. The cell also replicates its genetic material (DNA) during interphase. Interphase
consists of the following three sequential stages:
1. G1—During this stage, the cell grows and prepares for the replication of DNA, and some cellular organelles
(such as centrioles) are replicated.
2. S—During the S (synthesis) stage, DNA is replicated. When the S stage begins, each chromosome consists of
one chromatid. After DNA replication is completed, each chromosome has two identical chromatids held
together by one centromere. At the end of the S stage, the cell contains twice the amount of DNA it had at the
end of G1.
3. G2—During the G2 stage, the cell continues to grow and prepares the materials needed for mitosis, such as
the proteins that will make up the spindle fibers.
Mitosis (M Phase)
The goal of mitosis is to make sure there is an accurate transfer of a parent cell’s complete genome to each of the
two resulting daughter cells. Mitosis consists of four stages: prophase,
