7A elements in the third row of the periodic 
table and beyond, the octet rule is often not obeyed. A friend 
of yours says this is because these heavier elements are more 
likely to make double or triple bonds. Another friend of 
yours says that this is because the heavier elements are larger 
and can make bonds to more than four atoms at a time. 
Which friend is more correct?
 8.63 Draw the Lewis structures for each of the following ions 
or molecules. Identify those in which the octet rule is not 
obeyed; state which atom in each compound does not fol-
low the octet rule; and state, for those atoms, how many 
electrons surround these atoms: (a) PH3, (b) AlH3, (c) N3
-,  
(d) CH2Cl2, (e) SnF6
2-.
