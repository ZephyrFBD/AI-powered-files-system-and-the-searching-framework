bottom of the cylinder equal to
The net force on the cylin-

is the weight of fluid which takes up a
volume equal to the volume of the cylinder. Thus the buoyant force on the
cylinder is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the cylinder.
This result is valid no matter what the shape of the object. Its discovery is
credited to Archimedes (287?–212 B.C.), and it is called Archimedes’ principle:
the buoyant force on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of
the fluid displaced by that object.
By “fluid displaced,” we mean a volume of fluid equal to the submerged
volume of the object (or that part of the object that is submerged). If the object is
placed in a glass or tub initia
