e are in a simulation, as it appears, then space is
an abstract property wriĴen in code. It is not real’. No it’s not and if
we live in a simulation something created it and it wasn’t us. ‘That
David Icke says we are manipulated by aliens’ – he’s crackers.’
Wow …
The reality that humanity thinks is so real is an illusion. Politicians,
governments, scientists, doctors, academics, law enforcement,
media, school and university curriculums, on and on, are all
founded on a world that does not exist except as a simulated prison
cell. Is it such a stretch to accept that ‘Covid’ doesn’t exist when our
entire ‘physical’ reality doesn’t exist? Revealed here is the
knowledge kept under raps in the Cult networks of
compartmentalised secrecy to control humanity’s sense of reality by
inducing the population to believe in a reality that’s not real. If it
wasn’t so tragic in its experiential consequences the whole thing
would be hysterically funny. None of this is new to Renegade Minds.
