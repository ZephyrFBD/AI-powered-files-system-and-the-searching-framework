free to move away from their birthplace.
An adult female Belding’s ground squirrel acts as a sentinel,
standing up on her hind feet to sound loud alarm calls, trills, and
single-note whistles when an aerial or a terrestrial predator is sensed
nearby. Upon hearing the warning call, squirrels quickly try to
escape into their underground nests. By sending out an alarm, the
young may be protected, but the whistling adult female clearly puts
herself in danger. Data were collected comparing the distance in
meters that females and males move from their birthplace after
weaning. Choose the graph that best demonstrates kin selection by
females.
