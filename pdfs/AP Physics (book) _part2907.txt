calculate back to find
out when they actually occurred. For example, if two events are observed to
occur at the same time, but one actually took place farther from the observer
than the other, then the more distant one must have occurred earlier, and the two
events were not simultaneous.

We now imagine a simple thought experiment. Assume an observer, called O,
is located exactly halfway between points A and B where two events occur,
Fig. 26–3. Suppose the two events are lightning that strikes the points A and B, as
shown. For brief events like lightning, only short pulses of light (blue in
Fig. 26–3) will travel outward from A and B and reach O. Observer O “sees” the
events when the pulses of light reach point O. If the two pulses reach O
