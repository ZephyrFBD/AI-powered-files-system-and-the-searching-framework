 in describing
ecosystems?
a.
Both food chain and food web follow a single
path as energy is transferred in an ecosystem.
Food chains are easier to follow and experiment
with but less accurate whereas food webs are
more holistic and complex.
b.
Both food web and food chain describe energy
transfer dynamics in an ecosystem. Food chains
are non-linear systems which are easier to follow
and experiment with whereas food webs are
linear, holistic and can be directly used as input
for simulation models.
c.
Both food chain and food web follow a single
path as energy is transferred in an ecosystem.
Food chains are linear systems, easier to follow
and used directly as input for simulation models,
whereas food webs are non-linear, accurate,
holistic and flexible for analytical modeling.
d.
Both food web and food chain describe energy
transfer dynamics in an ecosystem. Food chains
are linear systems, easier to follow and
experiment with whereas food webs are non-
linear, accurate and holistic and
