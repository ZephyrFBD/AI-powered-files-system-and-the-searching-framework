species, which include half of Earth’s endemic plants.
Figure 38.4 Conservation International has identified 34 biodiversity hotspots, which cover only 2.3 percent of the
Earth’s surface but have endemic to them 42 percent of the terrestrial vertebrate species and 50 percent of the world’s
plants.
Biodiversity Change through Geological Time
The number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary
processes that are ongoing: speciation and extinction. Both are natural “birth” and “death” processes of macroevolution.
When speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species
will decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. Throughout Earth’s history, these two processes
have fluctuated—sometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on Earth as reflected in the fossil record
(Figure 38.5).
