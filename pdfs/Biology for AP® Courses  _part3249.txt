s. In
vertebrates, the main photopigment, rhodopsin, has two main parts Figure 27.19): an opsin, which is a membrane protein
(in the form of a cluster of α-helices that span the membrane), and retinal—a molecule that absorbs light. When light hits a
photoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear
(trans) isomer. This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing
of Na+ channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor. Thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized
by exposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold (Figure 27.20).
