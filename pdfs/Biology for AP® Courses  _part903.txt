prediction should make use of all the following facts:
•
signaling can be used to detect low-oxygen
environments and to regulate response
•
some cells, such as muscle and blood cells, must
function in both low- and high-oxygen environments
•
glycolysis is reversible
•
the citric acid cycle is not reversible
•
thermoregulation is needed for homeostasis
55. Dinitrophenol (DNP) was used in the manufacture of
munitions in World War I. In the 1930s, it was used as a
weight loss drug. Use in the U.S. cannot be regulated by
the FDA because DNP is considered a dietary supplement.
Attempts to ban the drug in the U.K. following the death
of four users in 2015 failed in Parliament. DNP is a small
molecule that is soluble in the mitochondrial inner
membrane. The hydroxyl group reversibly dissociates a
proton.
