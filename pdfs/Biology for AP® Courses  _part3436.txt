in lancelet. However, genes for the cell surface receptors
activated by these hormones are expressed. The same is
true for many different hormones and their corresponding
receptors. A large number of such “orphan” nuclear
receptors have been reported in animals where there is no
evidence of the presence of the hormone to which they
bind.
C. Analyze these data (a table to organize the data is
suggested) for supporting evidence of the alternative
superphylum, Coelomata. Consider:
•
separate selection of signaling molecules and the
proteins that detect them
•
constitutive (always transcribed) expression
•
the possible effect of gene deletion
D. Evaluate the legitimacy of a claim that a hormone is
not present although the receptor for that hormone has
been found.
Genes for receptors and the hormones to which they bind
are often found on different chromosomes and have co-
evolved. Other ligands may have an affinity for orphaned
receptors. By understanding the three-dimensional shape
of th
