ust be overcome by the plane’s engines.)
A flat wing, or one with symmetric cross section, will experience lift as long as
the front of the wing is tilted upward (attack angle). The wing shown in Fig. 10–25
can experience lift even if the attack angle is zero, because the rounded upper
surface deflects air up, squeezing the streamlines together. Airplanes can fly upside
down, experiencing lift, if the attack angle is sufficient to deflect streamlines up
and closer together.
Our picture considers streamlines; but if the attack angle is larger than about
15°, turbulence sets in (Fig. 10–18b) leading to greater drag and less lift, causing
the plane to “stall” and then to drop.
From another point of view, the upward tilt of a wing means the air moving
horizontally in front of the wing is deflected downward; the change in momentum
of the rebounding air molecules results in an upward force on the wing (Newton’s
third law).
