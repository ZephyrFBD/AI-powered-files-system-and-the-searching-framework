a high density of nuclei to ensure a sufficiently high collision rate. A real diffi-
culty with controlled fusion is to contain nuclei long enough and at a high 
enough density for sufficient reactions to occur so that a usable amount of 
energy is obtained. At the temperatures needed for fusion, the atoms are ionized,
and the resulting collection of nuclei and electrons is referred to as a plasma.
Ordinary materials vaporize at a few thousand degrees at most, and hence cannot
be used to contain a high-temperature plasma. Two major containment techniques
are magnetic confinement and inertial confinement.
In magnetic confinement, magnetic fields are used to try to contain the hot
plasma. A simple approach is the “magnetic bottle” shown in Fig. 31–13. The
paths of the charged particles in the plasma are bent by the magnetic field; where
magnetic field lines are close together, the force on the particles reflects them
