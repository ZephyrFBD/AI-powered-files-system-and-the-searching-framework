ins their behavior under most common 
conditions. We gain further insight by then comparing how real gases 
differ from this ideal model as conditions change. Thus, while we start 
with a description that treats all gases the same regardless of their chem-
ical identity, we end by gaining an understanding of important aspects 
of the physical behavior of molecules.
10.1 âˆ£ Characteristics of Gases
Of the few elements that exist as gases at ordinary temperatures and pressures, He, Ne, 
Ar, Kr, and Xe are monatomic and H2, N2, O2, F2, and Cl2 are diatomic. Many molecular 
compounds are gases, and Table 10.1 lists a few of them. Notice that all of these gases are 
composed entirely of nonmetallic elements. Furthermore, all have simple molecular for-
mulas and, therefore, low molar masses.
Substances that are liquids or solids under ordinary conditions can also exist in the 
gaseous state, where they are often referred to as vapors. The substance H2O, for exam-
ple, can exist as liquid wate
