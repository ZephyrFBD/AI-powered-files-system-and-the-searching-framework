tissue. This suggests that miR-215 protects against breast
cancer. (Note that this question only refers to breast cancer, not
to other causes of cancer.) Furthermore, the data on Graph B
suggest a mechanism for how the expression of miR-215
protects against cancer: it triggers apoptosis (cell death), which
removes cancerous cells from tissue.

SECTION I
Time: 90 minutes
Directions: For each question, choose the best answer choice.
Oxygen is carried in the blood by the respiratory pigment
hemoglobin, which can combine loosely with four oxygen
molecules to form the molecule oxyhemoglobin. To function
properly, hemoglobin must bind to oxygen in the lungs and drop the
oxygen off at the body cells. The more easily the hemoglobin binds
to oxygen in the lungs, the more difficult it will be for the
hemoglobin to unload the oxygen at the body cells. Below is a graph
that shows two different saturation-dissociation
