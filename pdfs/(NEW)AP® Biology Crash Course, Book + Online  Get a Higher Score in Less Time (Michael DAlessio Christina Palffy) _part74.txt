Key Concepts
A. In the mid-1800s, without knowledge of chromosomes or genes, but with careful experimentation and
statistical analysis, Gregor Mendel worked out the basic rules governing how heritable traits are
transmitted during sexual reproduction. These rules were Mendel’s principles of heredity.
B. The Law of Segregation is the principle that the two determinants of a characteristic, called alleles of a
gene, are separated during meiosis and are distributed to separate gametes.
C. The Law of Independent Assortment is the principle that the segregation of one set of alleles into gametes,
which determine one characteristic, is independent of the segregation of a second set of alleles governing
a second characteristic.
D. Genes are located on chromosomes, and in sexually reproducing organisms, alleles—different versions of
the same gene—are located at the same position on homologous chromosomes.
E. Understanding the use of probabilities and Punnett squares is important
