they need to digest their food faster than humans.
b. Birds need to eat often to maintain energy since they digest food quickly.
Ruminants
Ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows, sheep, and goats, whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of
roughage or fiber. They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose. An interesting
feature of the ruminants’ mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth. They use their lower teeth, tongue and lips to
tear and chew their food. From the mouth, the food travels to the esophagus and on to the stomach.
To help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated
in Figure 25.8. The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. These
chambers contain many microbes that break down cellulose and ferment ingested food. The abomasum is the “true” stomach
and is the equivalent of the monogastric stomac
