 cause plant growth either
in height or width. Apical meristems exist at the tips of roots and stems,
whereas lateral meristems (also known as cambium) are found within the
stem between layers of xylem and phloem on the sides of the plant. The
trunk of the plant thickens each year because the embryonic cells of the
cambium produce more and more xylem and phloem, supporting the
growth of a larger tree with more leaves. Upward growth that occurs as a
result of cell division within apical meristems is called primary growth,
while outward growth is called secondary growth. It is secondary growth
that causes the well-known concentric tree rings that one sees when a
large woody tree is cut down.
PLANT VASCULATURE
Terrestrial plants le»á an aquatic environment during their evolution, and
in the process lost some of the benefits that a liquid medium had
previously provided. Cell walls, which provided simple rigidity for
structures in small plants, became aligned, allowing for the growth of
tree
