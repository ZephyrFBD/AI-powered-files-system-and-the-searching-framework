ssures that we can’t know the position and momentum of a particle 
exactly, also raised many philosophical questions—so many, in fact, 
that Heisenberg wrote a book entitled Physics and Philosophy in 1958.
One of the most famous thought experiments put forward in 
the early days of the quantum theory was formulated by Schrödinger 
 
and is now known as “Schrödinger’s cat.” This experiment called 
into question whether a system could have multiple acceptable wave 
functions prior to observation of the system. In other words, if we 
don’t actually observe a system, can we know anything about the 
state it is in? In this paradox, a hypothetical cat is placed in a sealed 
box with an  
apparatus that will randomly trigger a lethal dose of poi-
son to the cat (as morbid as that sounds). According to some inter-
pretations of quantum theory, until the box is opened and the cat is 
observed, the cat must be considered simultaneously alive and dead.
Schrödinger posed this paradox to point out
