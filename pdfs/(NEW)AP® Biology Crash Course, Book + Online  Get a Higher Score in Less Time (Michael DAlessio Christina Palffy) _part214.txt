fuse across the cell, making
the cell flaccid.

 Photosynthesis
Analysis Question: What factors affect the rate of photosynthesis in living leaves?
Exercise 5A:
Median Rate of Photosynthesis
Interpretation of this Exercise
Photosynthesis can be measured either by the production of O2 or by the consumption of CO2. The
above chart shows how long it took each of the leaf disks to float to the surfaceâ€”indicating that
photosynthesis was taking place. The median of the disks floating is charted above, suggesting that it
took approximately 12 minutes for half of the leaves to float to the surface.

Interpretation of this Exercise
The above chart shows that the increase of light intensity also increases the rate of photosynthesis.
Be prepared to analyze this type of data either in chart form (as seen above) or on a line graph.
