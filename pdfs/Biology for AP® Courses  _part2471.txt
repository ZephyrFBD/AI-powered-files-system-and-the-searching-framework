nergy and carbon sources. Some are decomposers that are essential to the cycling of nutrients in ecosystems,
for example, carbon and nitrogen cycles. (Later, we will explore in more depth the role of these cycles in ecosystems.)
Many bacteria form symbiotic relationships with other organisms; for example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria live on the roots of
legumes. Other bacteria are disease-causing pathogens or parasites.
Like all cells, prokaryotes require macronutrients (including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur)
and micronutrients, such as metallic elements from growth and enzyme function.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP速 exam
questions. A learning object
