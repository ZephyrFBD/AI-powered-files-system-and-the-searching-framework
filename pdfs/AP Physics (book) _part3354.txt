 mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the mass of the daughter
nucleus plus the mass of the 
particle. The mass difference appears as kinetic
energy, which is carried away by the 
particle and the recoiling daughter nucleus.
The total energy released is called the disintegration energy, Q, or the Q-value
of the decay. From conservation of energy,
where Q equals the kinetic energy of the daughter and 
particle, and 
and 
are the masses of the parent, daughter, and 
particle, respectively. Thus

If the parent had less mass than the daughter plus the 
particle (so 
), the
decay would violate conservation of energy. Such decays have never been
observed, another confirmation of this great conservation law.
Uranium decay energy release. Calculate the disintegra-
tion energy when 
decays to

particle. (As always, masses given are for neutral atoms.)
APPROACH We use conservation of energy as expressed in Eq. 30â€“2.
