is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.3). If tryptophan is present in the environment,
then E. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched
off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated,
the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.

Figure 16.3 The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other in the trp
operon. When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence.
This physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the
repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.
A DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referr
