e cell.
Another limitation to cell size is the genome-to-volume ratio. The genome of a cell (the cellâ€™s genetic material or
chromosomes) remains fixed in size and fixed in its ability to control the activity of the cell (by producing RNA,
which in turn produces proteins). The genome may not be able to accommodate the protein (and enzyme) needs of a
large cell.
18. C. Divergence of species is indicated by horizontal changes. All of the horizontal changes and, thus, all of the
divergence, occurs in the area indicated by period IV.
19. B. Area III represents a period of time with little or no evolutionary change maintained by stabilizing selection.
20. A. Adaptive radiation can occur when a single species is introduced into an unoccupied area with many available
niches. Rapid evolution of many species occurs as the available niches are exploited. Once all the niches are filled,
evolutionary rates decline.
21. B. Each plot shows the accumulation of oxygen consumption as time passes. The sl
