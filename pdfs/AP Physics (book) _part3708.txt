was out in space where the gravitational field is essentially
zero, the released book would float, just as it does in Fig. 33–12. Next, if the
elevator (out in space) is accelerated upward (using rockets) at an acceleration of
the book as seen by our observer would fall to the floor with an
acceleration of 
just as if it were falling due to gravity at the surface of
the Earth. According to the principle of equivalence, the observer could not
determine whether the book fell because the elevator was accelerating upward,
or because a gravitational field was acting downward and the elevator was at rest.
The two descriptions are equivalent.
