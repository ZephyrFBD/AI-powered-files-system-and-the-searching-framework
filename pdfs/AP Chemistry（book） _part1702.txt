r attractive forces are strong enough to hold particles 
close together. Thus, liquids are much denser and far less compressible than gases. Unlike 
gases, liquids have a definite volume, independent of the size and shape of their con-
tainer. The attractive forces in liquids are not strong enough, however, to keep the par-
ticles from moving past one another. Thus, any liquid can be poured and assumes the 
shape of the container it occupies.
In solids the intermolecular attractive forces are strong enough to hold particles 
close together and to lock them virtually in place. Solids, like liquids, are not very com-
pressible because the particles have little free space between them. Because the particles 
in a solid or liquid are fairly close together compared with those of a gas, we often refer 
to solids and liquids as condensed phases. We will study solids in Chapter 12. For now it is 
sufficient to know that the particles of a solid are not free to undergo long-range move-
ment, wh
