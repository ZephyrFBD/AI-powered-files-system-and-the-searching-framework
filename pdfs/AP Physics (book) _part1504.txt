CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A 5-kg cube of warm iron (60°C) is put in thermal contact with a 10-kg cube of
cold iron (15°C). Which statement is valid?
(a) Heat flows spontaneously from the warm cube to the cold cube until both
cubes have the same heat content.
(b) Heat flows spontaneously from the warm cube to the cold cube until both
cubes have the same temperature.
(c) Heat can flow spontaneously from the warm cube to the cold cube, but can
also flow spontaneously from the cold cube to the warm cube.
(d) Heat flows from the larger cube to the smaller one because the larger one
has more internal energy.
W
hen a pot of cold water is placed on a hot burner of a stove, the tem-
perature of the water increases. We say that heat “flows” from the hot
burner to the cold water. When two objects at different temperatures
are put in contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter one to the colder one.
The spontaneous flow of heat i
