16. (II) How long would it take a message sent as radio waves
from Earth to reach Mars when Mars is (a) nearest Earth,
(b) farthest from Earth? Assume that Mars and Earth are
in the same plane and that their orbits around the Sun are
circles (Mars is
from the Sun).
17. (II) Our nearest star (other than the Sun) is 4.2 light-years
away. That is, it takes 4.2 years for the light it emits to reach
Earth. How far away is it in meters?
18. (II) A light-year is a measure of distance (not time). How
many meters does light travel in a year?
19. (II) Pulsed lasers used for science and medicine produce
very brief bursts of electromagnetic energy. If the laser
light wavelength is 1062 nm (Neodymium–YAG laser), and
the pulse lasts for 34 picoseconds, how many wavelengths
are found within the laser pulse? How brief would the pulse
need to be to fit only one wavelength?
