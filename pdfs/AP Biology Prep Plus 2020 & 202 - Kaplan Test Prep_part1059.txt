The sequence of nucleotide bases in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in
proteins. DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into amino acids. Amino acids
are the primary structure in proteins and determine a protein’s shape and function. Enzymes
are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. Thus, a genetic mutation affects the amino acid
sequence, which in turn may affect the enzyme structure during synthesis, as well as the
enzyme’s function.
(b) Propose an appropriate control treatment for the experiment, and describe how the
control treatment would increase the validity of the results. (2 points maximum)

A control treatment for the experiment would be to grow wild type Neurospora on minimal
medium and minimal medium with each supplement (arginine, citrulline, argininosuccinate, and
ornithine). This control would demons
