s carry out both photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Be sure to review the photosynthesis and
cellular respiration chart found in Chapter 6: Photosynthesis. Conceptually understand the inputs, outputs, and purpose for
major steps in both cell respiration and photosynthesis.

Homeostasis
I.
System Equilibrium
A. In all organisms, there are mechanisms to achieve homeostasis, the maintenance of stable internal
conditions in a system, such as a cell, organism, or ecosystem.
B. Many aspects of the environment can change, and organisms must respond accordingly.
1. Gas levels—Oxygen is constantly being used in cellular respiration and carbon dioxide is being
produced. Cells must have a way of gaining oxygen while excreting carbon dioxide.
i.
Without enough oxygen, ATP cannot be produced.
ii. With too much carbon dioxide, the pH of the cell will get too low.
2. Osmolarity—The balance of water and solutes must be maintained due to osmos
