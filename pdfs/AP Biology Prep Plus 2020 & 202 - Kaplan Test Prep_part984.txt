 three populations relative to one another

Describe the components of the logistic growth model given by 
. (1 point)
(a)
 is the change in the population size over the given time
N is the size of the original population
r is the rate of population growth 
K is the carrying capacity.

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
All of the populations start with the same number of individuals at the far
left of the curves. Logistic growth is typified by an ultimate plateau that is
equal to the carrying capacity: the higher the plateau, the higher the
carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals
an environment will support. Based on the plateaus of the three curves,
populations A and B have the same carrying capacity, which is higher than
it is for population C.
(c) Based on the graph, determine the relative growth rates of the
three populations. (1 poin
