 23.78  Some metal complexes have a coordination number of 5. 
One such complex is Fe(CO)5, which adopts a trigonal bipy-
ramidal geometry (see Figure 9.8). (a) Write the name for 
Fe(CO)5, using the nomenclature rules for coordination 
compounds. (b) What is the oxidation state of Fe in this 
compound? (c) Suppose one of the CO ligands is replaced 
with a CN- ligand, forming 3Fe(CO)4(CN)4-. How many 
geometric isomers would you predict this complex could 
have?
 23.79  Which of the following objects is chiral: (a) a left shoe, 
 
(b) a slice of bread, (c) a wood screw, (d) a molecular model 
of Zn(en)Cl2, (e) a typical golf club?
 23.80  The complexes 3V(H2O)643+ and 3VF643- are both known. 
(a) Draw the d-orbital energy-level diagram for V(III) octa-
hedral complexes. (b) What gives rise to the colors of these 
complexes? (c) Which of the two complexes would you 
expect to absorb light of higher energy?
