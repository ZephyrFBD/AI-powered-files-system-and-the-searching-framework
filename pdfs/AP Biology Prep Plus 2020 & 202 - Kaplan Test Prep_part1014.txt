ates an altered mRNA codon
that produces hemoglobin containing valine rather than glutamic acid. If
a person inherits both alleles for the sickle cell trait, that person’s
hemoglobin will polymerize under low oxygen conditions (i.e., elevated
physical activity). This can result in brain damage, paralysis, kidney
failure, and other very serious physiological problems.
53. Most biomass pyramids show a rapid decrease in biomass as
trophic level increases. In aquatic systems, however, this pattern
may be reversed so that one observes a larger standing crop of
consumers compared with producers. Which of the following
oﬀers the best explanation for this pattern?
Aquatic producers tend to have larger body sizes than
terrestrial producers.
(A)
Water is an easier medium to live in, so aquatic organisms
require less food.
(B)
Biomass in aquatic systems cannot be measured accurately.
(C)
Phytoplankton is rapidly consumed, but it has a high
turnover rate.
(D)
