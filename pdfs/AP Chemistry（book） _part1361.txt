e exhibits res-
onance and is especially stable? Discuss. (e) Consider cyclooctatet-
raene, C8H8, which has the octagonal structure shown below.
What experiments or calculations could you perform to determine 
whether cyclooctatetraene exhibits resonance?
Cyclooctatetraene
C—C bond. Draw the charge distribution you expect on the 
B—N bond within the molecule (using the delta plus and 
delta minus symbols mentioned in Section 8.4). (c) Boron 
trichloride also reacts with ammonia in a similar way to 
the trifluoride. Predict whether the B—N bond in the tri-
chloride reaction product would be more or less polar than 
the B—N bond in the trifluoride product, and justify your 
reasoning.
 8.110 Ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, is a very soluble salt in water. 
(a) Draw the Lewis structures of the ammonium and chlo-
ride ions. (b) Is there an N—Cl bond in solid ammonium chlo-
ride? (c) If you dissolve 14 g of ammonium chloride in 500.0 mL 
 
of water, what is the molar concentration of the solution
