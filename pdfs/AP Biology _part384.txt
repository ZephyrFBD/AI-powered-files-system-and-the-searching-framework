RNA. Transcription
occurs in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. (IST-

(B) DNA makes an exact copy of itself during replication. This
process occurs in a semiconservative fashion, as proven by
Meselson and Stahl. (IST-1)
(D) Griffith was the first to recognize the phenomenon of
transformation while working with pneumococcus bacteria. (IST-1)
(A) Translation is the process by which the codons of mRNA
sequence are changed into an amino acid sequence. Amino acids
present in the cytoplasm are carried by tRNA molecules to the
codons of the mRNA strand at the ribosome according to the base-
pairing rules (A with U and C with G). (IST-1)
(D) Ladders are usually included in a gel because they are calibrated
and identify the size of any fragment on the gel by comparing the
fragment to the ladder. (IST-1 & SP 2)
(D) The shorter a fragment is, the farther and faster it will run from
the well at the top of the gel in this image. (IST-1)
(B) Since there are three bands, that m
