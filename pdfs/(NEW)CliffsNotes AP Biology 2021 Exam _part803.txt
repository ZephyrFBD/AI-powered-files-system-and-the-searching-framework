by transpiration is the dominant mechanism for
the movement of water up a stem.
On very hot or dry days, the loss of water by transpiration may exceed the rate by which water enters the roots.
Under these conditions, the stomata may close to prevent wilting.
Part I: Density of Stomata
In the first part of this lab, you investigate the relationship between the density of stomata and habitat. To calculate
the density, you divide the average number of stomata by the average surface area of a leaf. To count the stomata,
you prepare a stomatal peel and examine it under a microscope.
Although stomatal density varies among species, it also varies among plants of the same species and among leaves
of a single plant. You should consider a variety of factors that may be responsible, many of which are discussed
here:
1. Temperature. When the temperature of liquid water rises, the kinetic energy of the water molecules increases. As
a result, the rate at which liquid water is converted to water vapo
