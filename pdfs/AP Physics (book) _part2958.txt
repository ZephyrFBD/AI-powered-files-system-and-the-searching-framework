ity relative to one another. Accelerating reference frames are
noninertial.
The special theory of relativity is based on two principles:
the relativity principle, which states that the laws of physics 
are the same in all inertial reference frames, and the principle
of the constancy of the speed of light, which states that the
speed of light in empty space has the same value in all inertial
reference frames.
One consequence of relativity theory is that two events
that are simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simul-
taneous in another. Other effects are time dilation: moving
clocks are measured to run slow; and length contraction:
the length of a moving object is measured to be shorter (in its
direction of motion) than when it is at rest. Quantitatively,
