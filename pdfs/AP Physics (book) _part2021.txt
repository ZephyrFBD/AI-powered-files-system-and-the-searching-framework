oltage difference.
(c) the lightbulb may be old with low resistance. It would
take longer if the bulb were new and had high 
resistance.
(d) the electricity bill is paid. The electric company can
make it take longer when the bill is unpaid.

Problem 8.
7. When current flows through a resistor,
(a) some of the charge is used up by the resistor.
(b) some of the current is used up by the resistor.
(c) Both (a) and (b) are true.
(d) Neither (a) nor (b) is true.
8. The unit kilowatt-hour is a measure of
(a) the rate at which energy is transformed.
(b) power.
(c) an amount of energy.
(d) the amount of power used per second.
9. Why might a circuit breaker open if you plug too many
electrical devices into a single circuit?
(a) The voltage becomes too high.
(b) The current becomes too high.
(c) The resistance becomes too high.
(d) A circuit breaker will not “trip” no matter how many
electrical devices you plug into the circuit.
