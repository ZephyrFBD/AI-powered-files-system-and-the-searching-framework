eir life cycles depend upon their ability to enter and
replicate within a living host cell, and they have no cell membranes or
organelles as part of their structure.
Virus particles are surrounded by a capsid, or protein shell, which can
come in a variety of shapes (cones, rods, and polyhedrons). Capsids are
built out of proteins, many of which have various sugars attached to
them, poking upward from the viral surface. These glycoproteins are used
to gain entry into a living cell by binding with surface proteins on the
living cell’s membrane. Most viral capsids are made up of only one or two
diﬀerent types of protein. In addition, some viruses are able to surround
themselves with an envelope of cell membrane as they burst out of a cell
they have just infected. This viral envelope can help them avoid detection
by the host’s immune system, because the viral particles resemble (at
least on the outside) the host’s own cells.
