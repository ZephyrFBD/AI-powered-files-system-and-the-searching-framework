 Earth to the Moon experience zero
net force because the Earth and Moon pull in opposite
directions with equal force?
31. (II) Two objects attract each other gravitationally with a
force of
when they are 0.25 m apart. Their
total mass is 4.00 kg. Find their individual masses.
32. (II) A hypothetical planet has a radius 2.0 times that of
Earth, but has the same mass. What is the acceleration due
to gravity near its surface?

Problem 18.
14. (II) On an ice rink two skaters of equal mass grab hands and
spin in a mutual circle once every 2.5 s. If we assume their
arms are each 0.80 m long and their individual masses are
55.0 kg, how hard are they pulling on one another?
15. (II) A coin is placed 13.0 cm from the axis of a rotating
turntable of variable speed. When the speed of the turn-
table is slowly increased, the coin remains fixed on the
turntable until
