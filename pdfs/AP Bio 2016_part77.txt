 will be prevented from interacting with CAMs, causing the cell cycle to stop permanently. 
(B) The ras protein will remain bound to DNA, blocking expression of genes required for mitosis. 
(C) Growth-factor signaling can trigger mitosis in cells that are in direct contact with other cells. 
(D) The receptor proteins of body cells will no longer bind to growth-factor proteins.

39. In Drosophila melanogaster the allele for wild-type tan body color (B) is dominant to the recessive allele
for black body color (b). Similarly, the allele for wild-type wing shape (V) is dominant to the recessive allele
for vestigial wing phenotype (v). In the cross diagrammed above, the expected and observed results are shown.
Which of the following best explains the observed results of the cross?
(A) The alleles for body color and wing shape assort independently, as predicted by Mendelâ€™s laws.
(B) The genes f
