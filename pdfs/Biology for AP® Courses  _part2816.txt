e area for their mass than larger ones (Figure 24.4). Therefore, smaller
animals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature.
This results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal.

Energy Requirements Related to Levels of Activity
The more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its BMR or SMR. The
average daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal’s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary
than most animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.
