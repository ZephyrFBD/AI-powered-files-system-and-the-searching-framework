eptors form an important class of integral membrane proteins that transmit signals from the extracellular space
into the cytoplasm. Each receptor binds a particular molecule in a highly specific way.
There are three classes of membrane receptors.
1. Ligand-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane open or close an ion channel upon binding a particular
ligand. An example is the ligand-gated sodium channel on the surface of a skeletal muscle cell at the
neuromuscular junction. This channel opens in response to acetylcholine, and a massive influx of sodium
depolarizes the muscle cell and causes it to contract.
2. Catalytic (enzyme-linked) receptors have an enzymatic active site on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.
Enzyme activity is initiated by ligand binding at the extracellular surface. The insulin receptor is an example of
an enzyme-linked receptor. After binding insulin, enzymatic activity initiates a complex signaling pathway that
allows the cell to grow, synthesize lipids, and
