dark, electrically
charged areas. The drum then transfers the image to paper, as in a photocopier.
An inkjet printer does not use a drum. Instead nozzles spray tiny droplets of
ink directly at the paper. The nozzles are swept across the paper, each sweep just
above the previous one as the paper moves down. On each sweep, the ink makes
dots on the paper, except for those points where no ink is desired, as directed by
the computer. The image consists of a huge number of very tiny dots. The quality
or resolution of a printer is usually specified in dots per inch (dpi) in each (linear)
direction.

16–12 Gauss’s Law
An important relation in electricity is Gauss’s law, developed by the great mathe-
matician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). It relates electric charge and electric
field, and is a more general and elegant form of Coulomb’s law.
Gauss’s law involves the concept of electric flux, which refers to the electric
field passing through a give
