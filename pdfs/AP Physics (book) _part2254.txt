nt magnets. Ferromagnetic
materials are made up of tiny domains—each a tiny magnet—
which are preferentially aligned in a permanent magnet. When
iron or another ferromagnetic material is placed in a magnetic
field 
due to a current, the iron becomes magnetized. When
the current is turned off, the material remains magnetized;
when the current is increased in the opposite direction, a graph
of the total field B versus 
is a hysteresis loop, and the fact
that the curve does not retrace itself is called hysteresis.]

1. A compass needle is not always balanced parallel to the
Earth’s surface, but one end may dip downward. Explain.
2. Explain why the Earth’s “north pole” is really a magnetic
south pole. Indicate how north and south magnetic poles
were defined and how we can tell experimentally that the
north pole is really a south magnetic pole.
3. In what direction are the magnetic field lines surrounding
a straight wir
