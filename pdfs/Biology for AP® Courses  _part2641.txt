als to the leaves. The phloem transports the photosynthetic products
from the leaf to the other parts of the plant. A single vascular bundle, no matter how large or small, always contains both
xylem and phloem tissues.

Leaf Adaptations
Coniferous plant species that thrive in cold environments, like spruce, fir, and pine, have leaves that are reduced in size and
needle-like in appearance. These needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid
in reducing water loss. In hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination
with their succulent stems, help to conserve water. Many aquatic plants have leaves with wide lamina that can
