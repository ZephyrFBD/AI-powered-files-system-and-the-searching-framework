 
NaF, MgF2, and ScF3 (Figure 12.27). Sodium fluoride has the sodium chloride structure 
with a coordination number of 6 for both cation and anion, as you might expect since 
NaF and NaCl are quite similar. Magnesium fluoride, however, has two anions for every 
cation, resulting in a tetragonal crystal structure called the rutile structure. The cation 
coordination number is still 6, but the fluoride coordination number is now only 3. In 
the scandium fluoride structure, there are three anions for every cation; the cation coor-
dination number is still 6, but the fluoride coordination number has dropped to 2. As 
the cation/anion ratio goes down, there are fewer cations to surround each anion, and so 
the anion coordination number must decrease. The empirical formula of an ionic com-
pound can be described quantitatively by the relationship
 
Number of cations per formula unit
Number of anions per formula unit = anion coordination number
