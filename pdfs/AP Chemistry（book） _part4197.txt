Co3+ ion has 4 unpaired elec-
trons, assuming all five d orbitals have the same energy. page 1013 
Because Ti(IV) ions have an 3Ar4 3d0 electron configuration there are 
no d-d transitions that can absorb photons of visible light. page 
1016 d4, d5, d6, d7. page 1018 Because the ligands are located in 
the xy plane, electrons in a dxy orbital, which has its lobes in the xy 
plane, feel more repulsion than electrons in the dxz and dyz orbitals.

page 1033 C “ N, because it is a polar double bond. C ¬ H and C
¬ C bonds are relatively unreactive. (The CN double bond does not 
have to fully break to be reactive.) page 1035 Two C ¬ H bonds 
and two C ¬ C bonds page 1036 The isomers have different prop-
erties, as seen in Table 24.3 (e.g., different melting points and dif-
ferent boiling points). page 1039 Yes, since cyclopropane is more 
strained. page 1041 Only two of the four possible C “  C bond 
sites are distinctly different in the linear chain of five carbon atoms
