l including DNA analysis, has blossomed. New computer programs not only confirm many earlier
classified organisms, but also uncover previously made errors. As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can
be tricky to read in some cases. For some situations, two very closely related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation

occurred that caused a shift in the genetic code. An insertion or deletion mutation would move each nucleotide base over
one place, causing two similar codes to appear unrelated.
Sometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in
the same locations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not. For both of these situations,
computer technologies have been developed to help identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of
both morphologic and molecular information is more effective in determining p
