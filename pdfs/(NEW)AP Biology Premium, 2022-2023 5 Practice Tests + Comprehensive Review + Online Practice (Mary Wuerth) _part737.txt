lt because water will move from the area of higher water potential in the celery to
the area of lower water potential in the 1.0 molar sodium chloride solution. Based on the fact that the celery
cells became stiff in the distilled water, they must have a lower water potential than that of the distilled water,
so choice (A) is incorrect. Since the celery cells wilted in the sodium chloride solution, the water potential in the
celery cells must be higher than the water potential in the sodium chloride solution, so choice (B) is incorrect.
Celery cells have solutes and therefore cannot have a higher water potential than that of distilled water, so
choice (C) is incorrect.
22. (B) Photosynthesis requires light energy, so the vial covered in foil will only perform cellular respiration.
Cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide, which forms an acid when dissolved in water and therefore lowers
the pH. The vial without foil performs both cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Photosynthes
