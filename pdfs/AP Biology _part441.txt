he agents of change for a population, that is, those things that cause
evolution, are genetic drift, gene flow, mutations, nonrandom mating,
and natural selection.
Genetic Drift
Genetic drift is change in the gene pool due to chance. It is a fluctuation

in the frequency of alleles from one generation to another and is
unpredictable. It tends to limit diversity. There are two examples: the
bottleneck effect and the founder effect.

In addition to natural selection, chance and random events can influence evolution,
especially for small populations.
Bottleneck effect: Natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, and
floods, reduce the size of a population unselectively, resulting in a
loss of genetic variation. The resulting population is much smaller
and not representative of the original one. Certain alleles may be
underrepresented or overrepresented compared with that of the
original population. This is known as the bottleneck eff
