 converted into glucose, sucrose, or any
of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things
need to survive.
Figure 8.4 Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates.
Oxygen is generated as a waste product of photosynthesis.
The following is the chemical equation for photosynthesis (Figure 8.5):
Figure 8.5 The basic equation for photosynthesis is deceptively simple. In reality, the process takes place in many
steps involving intermediate reactants and products. Glucose, the primary energy source in cells, is made from two
three-carbon GA3Ps.
Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before

learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures
involved.
In plants, photosynthesis generally tak
