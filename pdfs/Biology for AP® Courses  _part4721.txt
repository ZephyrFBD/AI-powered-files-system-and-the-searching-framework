easures of biodiversity, some of which
are important for planning how to preserve biodiversity.
Genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts. Genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a
species. A speciesâ€™ future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in
populations that make up the species. The same is true for higher taxonomic categories. A genus with very different types
of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that look alike and have similar ecologies. If there
were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent
evolution is the most genetically diverse one. It would be ideal not to have to make such choices, but increasingly this may
be the norm.

Many genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep orga
