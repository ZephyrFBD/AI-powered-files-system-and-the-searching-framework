llation (ignoring damping)?
72. A diving board oscillates with simple harmonic motion of
frequency 2.8 cycles per second. What is the maximum
amplitude with which the end of the board can oscillate in
order that a pebble placed there (Fig. 11–56) does not lose
contact with the board during the oscillation?
77. Tall buildings are designed to sway in the wind. In a
wind, suppose the top of a 110-story building
oscillates horizontally with an amplitude of 15 cm at its
natural frequency, which corresponds to a period of 
7.0 s. Assuming SHM, find the maximum horizontal velocity
and acceleration experienced by an employee as she sits
working at her desk located on the top floor. Compare the
maximum acceleration (as a percentage) with the accelera-
tion due to gravity.
78. When you walk with a cup of coffee (diameter 8 cm) at just
the right pace of about one step per second, the coffee
sloshes higher and higher in your cup until eventually it
starts to spill over the top, Fig 11–59. Estimate
