. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon
atoms, it takes three “turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps,
thus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used

to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used
in these regeneration reactions.

Explain why the process of producing glucose in plants is a cycle.
a.
Three RuBP molecules get converted to three G3P, and two G3P molecules with the help of three ATPs are
converted back to three molecules of RuBP.
b.
Three RuBP molecules get co
