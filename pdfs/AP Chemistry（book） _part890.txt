tted (quanta 
being the plural of quantum). Because the energy can be released only in specific amounts, 
we say that the allowed energies are quantized—their values are restricted to certain quan-
tities. Planck’s revolutionary proposal that energy is quantized was proved correct, and he 
was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum theory.
If the notion of quantized energies seems strange, it might be helpful to draw an 
analogy by comparing a ramp and a staircase (Figure 6.6). As you walk up a ramp, your 
potential energy increases in a uniform, continuous manner. When you climb a stair-
case, you can step only on individual stairs, not between them, so that your potential 
energy is restricted to certain values and is therefore quantized.
If Planck’s quantum theory is correct, why are its effects not obvious in our daily lives? 
Why do energy changes seem continuous rather than quantized, or “jagged”?

the Planck constant is an extremely small n
