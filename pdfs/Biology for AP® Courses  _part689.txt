 different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be
transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and
transformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. Gas
stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful
energy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight into the chemical energy stored within organic
molecules, as shown in Figure 6.2. Some examples of energy transformations are shown in Figure 6.11.
The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or
transform into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well. Chemical energy stored
within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transformed through a series of cell
