), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone molecules enter
the VNO.
Pheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects
directly to the amygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such
as fear). The pheromonal signal then continues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive
physiology and behavior. While some scientists assert that the VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in
humans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal cavities, others are researching
it as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of menstrual cycles
in women living in close proximity.
