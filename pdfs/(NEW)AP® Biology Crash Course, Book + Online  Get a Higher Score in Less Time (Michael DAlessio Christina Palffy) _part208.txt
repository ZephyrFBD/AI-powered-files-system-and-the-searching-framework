bove can
quickly project the presence of specific alleles and take into account multiple factors that would alter
its presence in one or more populations. These programs are useful learning tools for students to be
able to plug in different allele frequencies and see the consequences on the chart; these programs are
useful to researchers because they save time that otherwise would be spent calculating these
projections by hand.

Interpretation of this Exercise
Cladograms are used to map out the evolutionary connections between different organisms and also
to demonstrate which specific traits (e.g., vascular
