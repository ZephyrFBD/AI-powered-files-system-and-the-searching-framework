ed contains 146 amino acids. The substitution of an amino 
acid with a hydrocarbon side chain for one that has an acidic functional group in the 
side chain alters the solubility properties of the hemoglobin, and normal blood flow is 
impeded. 
 (Section 13.6, “Sickle-Cell Anemia”)
Proteins in living organisms are not simply long, flexible chains with random 
shapes. Rather, the chains self-assemble into structures based on the intermolecular 
forces we learned about in Chapter 11. This self-assembling leads to a protein’s second-
ary structure, which refers to how segments of the protein chain are oriented in a reg-
ular pattern, as seen in Figure 24.18.
One of the most important and common secondary structure arrangements is 
the A1alpha2@helix. The alpha helix is held in position by hydrogen bonds between 
amide H atoms and carbonyl O atoms in the main chain, not the side chains, of the 
protein. The pitch of the helix and its diameter must be such that (1) no bond angles 
are strai
