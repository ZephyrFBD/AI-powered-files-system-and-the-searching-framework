The average speed of a nitrogen molecule in air at 25 °C is 515 m>s. Convert this speed to miles per hour.
SOLUTION
To go from the given units, m/s, to the desired units, mi/hr, we 
must convert meters to miles and seconds to hours. From our 
knowledge of SI prefixes we know that 1 km = 103 m. From the 
relationships given on the back inside cover of the book, we find 
that 1 mi = 1.6093 km. Thus, we can convert m to km and then 
convert km to mi. From our knowledge of time we know that 
60 s = 1 min and 60 min = 1 hr. Thus, we can convert s to min 
and then convert min to hr. The overall process is
