ity of CaCO3 is pH dependent. (a) Calculate the 
molar solubility of CaCO3 1Ksp = 4.5 * 10-92 neglecting 
the acid–base character of the carbonate ion. (b) Use the Kb 
expression for the CO3
2 -  ion to determine the equilibrium 
constant for the reaction
CaCO31s2 + H2O1l2 ∆ 
Ca2 +1aq2 + HCO3
-1aq2 + OH-1aq2
 
 (c) If we assume that the only sources of Ca2 +, HCO3
-, 
and OH- ions are from the dissolution of CaCO3, what is

the molar solubility of CaCO3 using the equilibrium ex-
pression from part (b)? (d) What is the molar solubility of 
CaCO3 at the pH of the ocean (8.3)? (e) If the pH is buffered 
at 7.5, what is the molar solubility of CaCO3?
 17.100  Tooth enamel is composed of hydroxyapatite, whose sim-
plest formula is Ca51PO423OH, and whose corresponding 
Ksp = 6.8 * 10-27. As discussed in the Chemistry and Life 
box on page 746, fluoride in fluorinated water or in tooth-
paste reacts with hydroxyapatite to form fluoroapa
