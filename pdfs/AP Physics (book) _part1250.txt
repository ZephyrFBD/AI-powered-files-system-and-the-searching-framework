by what factor does the bug’s maximum
KE change?
47. (II) Two earthquake waves of the same frequency travel
through the same portion of the Earth, but one is carrying
5.0 times the energy. What is the ratio of the amplitudes 
of the two waves?
11–11 Interference
48. (I) The two pulses shown in Fig. 11–54 are moving toward
each other. (a) Sketch the shape of the string at the moment
they directly overlap. (b) Sketch the shape of the string a
few moments later. (c) In Fig. 11–37a, at the moment 
the pulses pass each other, the string is straight. What has
happened to the energy at this moment?

49. (I) If a violin string vibrates at 440 Hz as its fundamental
frequency, what are the frequencies of the first four 
harmonics?
50. (I) A violin string vibrates at 294 Hz when unfingered. At
what frequency will it vibrate if it is fingered one-third of
the way down from the end? (That is, only two-thirds of the
stri
