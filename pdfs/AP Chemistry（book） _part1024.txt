a transition of the electron in the hydrogen atom from 
n = 4 to n = 9. (a) Is ∆E for this process positive or negative? 
 
(b) Determine the wavelength of light that is  
associated with this 
transition. Will the light be absorbed or emitted? (c) In which 
portion of the electromagnetic  
spectrum is the light in part (b)?
 6.41  The visible emission lines observed by Balmer all involved 
nf = 2. (a) Which of the following is the best explanation of 
why the lines with nf = 3 are not observed in the visible por-
tion of the spectrum: (i) Transitions to nf = 3 are not allowed 
to happen, (ii) transitions to nf = 3 emit photons in the 
infrared portion of the spectrum, (iii) transitions to nf = 3 
emit photons in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, or 
(iv) transitions to nf = 3 emit photons that are at exactly the 
same wavelengths as those to nf = 2. (b) Calculate the wave-
lengths of the first three lines in the Balmer series—those for 
which ni = 3, 4, and 5—and identify these
