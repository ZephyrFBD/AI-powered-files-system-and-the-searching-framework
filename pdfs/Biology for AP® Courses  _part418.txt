 have sufficient surface area to support the rate of
diffusion required for the increased volume. In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become
more efficient is to divide; another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks. These adaptations lead to the
development of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells.
Besides the volume of the cell, the size of the cell is also important for survival. As mentioned before, most cells are
approximately spherical in shape. This is because a sphere is the shape with the largest surface area-to-volume ratio. As
nutrients diffuse into the cell, a sphere is the shape where nutrients would have to travel the least distance to reach the center.
This is important because nutrients and wastes are always exchanged at the periphery of the cell. The shorter the distance
these nutrients and wastes have to travel, the faster the exchange of these molecules are.
