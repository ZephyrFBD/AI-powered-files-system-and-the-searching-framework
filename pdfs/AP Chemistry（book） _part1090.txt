nce, electrons simultaneously 
migrate from anode to cathode through 
an external circuit, thereby producing 
electricity.
At the cathode, lithium ions then in-
sert in the oxide material. Again, the small 
size of lithium ions is an advantage. For 
every lithium ion that inserts into the lith-
ium cobalt oxide cathode, a Co4 + ion is 
reduced to a Co3 +  ion by an electron that 
has traveled through the external circuit.
The ion migration and the changes 
in structure that result when lithium 
ions enter and leave the electrode materials are complicated. Fur-
thermore, the operation of all batteries generate heat because they 
are not perfectly efficient. In the case of Li-ion batteries, the heating 
of the separator material (typically a polymer) has led to problems as 
the size of the batteries has been scaled larger to increase energy ca-
pacity. In a very small number of cases, overheating of Li-ion batter-
ies has caused the batteries to catch fire.
