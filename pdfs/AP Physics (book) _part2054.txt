19–2 Resistors in Series and in Parallel
When two or more resistors are connected end to end along a single path as
shown in Fig. 19–3a, they are said to be connected in series. The resistors could
be simple resistors as were pictured in Fig. 18–11, or they could be lightbulbs
(Fig. 19–3b), or heating elements, or other resistive devices. Any charge that
passes through
