Cell Structure 
and Function
(A) 
Incorrect. The extensive folding significantly increases the surface area, 
not the volume.
(B) 
Correct. The extensive folding provides more surface area for proteins 
involved in energy transfer.
(C) 
Incorrect. The extensive folding does increase the area over which 
diffusion of water can occur, but this is not the main advantage, and the 
inner membrane is not on the surface of the mitochondria.
(D) 
Incorrect. The extensive folding does not provide greater insulation for 
reactions.
