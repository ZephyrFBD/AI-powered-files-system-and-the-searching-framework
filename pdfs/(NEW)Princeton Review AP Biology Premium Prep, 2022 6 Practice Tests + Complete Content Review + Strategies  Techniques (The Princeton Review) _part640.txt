A by a bacterium. DNA uptake by a virus, (A), would be a
transduction, although this requires a virus to gain the DNA via infection of a bacterium.

The least likely explanation for why mutations are low is that mutations produce variability in a gene
pool. Any gene is bound to mutate. This produces a constant input of new genetic information into a gene
pool. Choice (D) is therefore correct, because it doesnâ€™t give any additional information about the rate of
mutations. Some mutations are subtle and cause only a slight decrease in reproductive output, so
eliminate (A). Some mutations are harmful and decrease the productive success of the individual, so (B)
is incorrect. Some mutations are deleterious and lead to total reproductive failure. The zygote fails to
develop. Therefore, (C) can also be eliminated.

The independent variable is the condition the scientist sets up. The dependent variable is the thing that is
the measured outcome of the experiment. The scientist should
