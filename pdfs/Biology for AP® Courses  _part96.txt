nce we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? And,
finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we
can better understand them? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and
other questions.
Properties of Life
All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment,
