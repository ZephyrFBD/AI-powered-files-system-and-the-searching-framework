 At 700 K, the equilibrium constant Kp for this reaction is 
0.26. Predict the behavior of each of the following mix-
tures at this temperature and indicate whether or not the 
mixtures are at equilibrium. If not, state whether the mix-
ture will need to produce more products or reactants to 
reach equilibrium.

 [15.90] The reaction PCl31g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ PCl51g2 has Kp =
0.0870 at 300 °C. A flask is charged with 0.50 atm 
PCl3, 0.50 atm Cl2, and 0.20 atm PCl5 at this temperature.
