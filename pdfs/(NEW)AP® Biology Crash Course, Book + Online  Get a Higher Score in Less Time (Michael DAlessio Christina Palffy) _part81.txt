Example ABO Cross: Assume that a child has type B blood and the father was type A. What are the
possible genotypes of the mother?
Answer: Child could be IB IB or IB i and the father could be IA i. The mother could be either IB IB or
IB i or IA IB. If the father was IA IA no matter what genotype the mother is, a type B child could not be
produced.
4. Pleiotropy—one gene causes multiple different phenotypic effects on an organism.
An example of pleiotropy is PKU, which causes the following:
Human Disease PKU (phenylketonuria) Phenotypes
Cognitive Impairment
Seizures
Skin Disorders
5. Epistasis—one gene affecting the expression of another gene. F2 offspring phenotypic
