more electronegative and will form the more polar 
bond with P
. The higher electronegativity of fluorine means 
that it will carry the partial negative charge.
Check
(a) Using Figure 8.8: The difference in the electronegativities 
of chlorine and boron is 3.0 - 2.0 = 1.0; the difference 
between the electronegativities of chlorine and carbon is 
3.0 - 2.5 = 0.5. Hence, the B¬ Cl bond is more polar, as  
we had predicted.
(b) Using Figure 8.8: The difference in the electronegativities of 
chlorine and phosphorus is 3.0 - 2.1 = 0.9; the difference 
between the electronegativities of fluorine and phosphorus  
is 4.0 - 2.1 = 1.9. Hence, the P¬F bond is more polar, as  
we had predicted.
Dipole Moments
The difference in electronegativity between H and F leads to a polar covalent bond in the 
HF molecule. As a consequence, there is a concentration of negative charge on the more 
electronegative F atom, leaving the less electronegative H atom at the positive end of the 
molecule. A molecule
