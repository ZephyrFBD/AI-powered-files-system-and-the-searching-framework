odic table also have names, listed in Table 2.3.
We will learn in Chapters 6  and 7  that elements in a group have similar prop-
erties because they have the same arrangement of electrons at the periphery of their 
atoms. However, we need not wait until then to make good use of the periodic table; 
after all, the chemists who developed the table knew nothing about electrons! We 
can use the table, as they intended, to correlate behaviors of elements and to help us 
remember many facts.
The color code of Figure 2.14  shows that, except for hydrogen, all the elements 
on the left and in the middle of the table are metallic elements, or metals. All the 
metallic elements share characteristic properties, such as luster and high electrical and 
heat conductivity, and all of them except mercury (Hg) are solid at room temperature.*
