hromosomes pair. During synapsis, crossing over between nonsister chromatids of
homologous pairs results in an exchange of genetic material. The microtubules connect to the kinetochores in the
centromeres of the chromosomes and pull on the chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Metaphase I occurs when the
chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate as homologous pairs. Anaphase I begins as each member of a
homologous pair of chromosomes is pulled by the microtubules to opposite poles. Telophase I follows when nuclear
membranes appear. Cytokinesis and a short interphase II may occur at this point. Prophase II begins in each
daughter cell in the same manner as prophase I. However, synapsis does not occur, and at metaphase II, the
chromosomes are spread over the metaphase plate without any kind of pairing. Anaphase II begins as each
chromosome is separated into two chromatids (now called chromosomes) and pulled by the microtubules of the
spindle apparatus to opposite poles. During telopha
