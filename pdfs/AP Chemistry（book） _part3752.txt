metal ions bonded to several surrounding anions or 
molecules known as ligands. The metal ion and its ligands make up 
the coordination sphere of the complex. The number of atoms attached 
to the metal ion is the coordination number of the metal ion. The most 
common coordination numbers are 4 and 6; the most common coor-
dination geometries are tetrahedral, square planar, and octahedral.
COMMON LIGANDS IN COORDINATION CHEMISTRY (SECTION 
23.3) Ligands that occupy only one site in a coordination sphere 
are called monodentate ligands. The atom of the ligand that bonds to 
the metal ion is the donor atom. Ligands that have two donor atoms 
are bidentate ligands. Polydentate ligands have three or more donor 
atoms. Bidentate and polydendate ligands are also called chelating 
agents. In general, chelating agents form more stable complexes than 
do related monodentate ligands, an observation known as the che-
late effect. Many biologically important molecules, such as the por-
phyrins, are
