thus correct. (B) is incorrect
because the negative control is actually exerted in the caudal region,
not the rostral region. (If negative control were exerted in the rostral
region, then forelimb development would be inhibited in the rostral
and allowed to progress in the caudal region instead.) (C) and (D) are
incorrect because repression is a type of negative control, not positive
control.

Because abd-A increases much more in workers than in queens, it is
likely to be important for the diﬀerences in worker hindlimbs. (C) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect because queens actually express atx-2 the
most at the L4 stage. (B) is incorrect because dac is expressed at a
relatively constant level in queens, but it appears to decrease in
workers. (D) is incorrect because the diﬀerence in dll expression
between queens and workers is relatively minimal.
