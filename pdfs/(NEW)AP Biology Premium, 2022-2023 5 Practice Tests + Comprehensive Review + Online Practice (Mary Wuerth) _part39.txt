eans you cannot reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the null
hypothesis cannot be ruled out.
Here is another example: A coin has heads on one side and tails on the other side. If the coin is flipped 40 times,
you would expect the coin to come up heads 20 times and come up tails 20 times. These are the expected results.
The coin is flipped 40 times, and the coin comes up heads 12 times and it comes up tails 28 times. Those are the
observed results. The null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant difference between the observed and
expected numbers of heads and tails. To evaluate this null hypothesis, here are the steps involved:
1. Calculate the chi-square value.
2. Determine the number of degrees of freedom (df) in the experiment. There are two possible outcomes in this
experiment (heads or tails), so the df is 2 â€“ 1 = 1.
3. Using a df of 1 and a p-value of 0.05, the critical value is 3.84 according to the chi-square table.
4. Compare your calculated chi-squar
