mixture regardless of the identities or rela-
tive proportions of the gases; the atmosphere serves as an excellent example. Two or more 
liquids or two or more solids may or may not form homogeneous mixtures, depending 
on their chemical nature. For example, when water and gasoline are mixed, the two liq-
uids remain as separate layers. In contrast, the water vapor and gasoline vapors above the 
liquids form a homogeneous gas mixture.
The characteristic properties of gases—expanding to fill a container, being highly 
compressible, forming homogeneous mixtures—arise because the molecules are rela-
tively far apart. In any given volume of air, for example, the molecules take up only about 
0.1% of the total volume with the rest being empty space. Thus, each molecule behaves 
largely as though the others were not present. As a result, different gases behave similarly 
even though they are made up of different molecules.
