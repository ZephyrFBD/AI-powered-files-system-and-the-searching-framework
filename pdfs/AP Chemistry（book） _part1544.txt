 amount of 
energy needed to excite an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO 
in each of these molecules? (b) How might you graph your data to 
determine whether a relationship exists between the length of the 
p system and the excitation energy? (c) What additional molecules 
might you want to procure to further test the ideas developed here? 
(d) How could you design an experiment to determine whether the 
delocalized p systems and not some other molecular features, such as 
molecular length or the presence of p bonds, are important in mak-
ing the excitations occur in the visible portion of the spectrum? (Hint: 
You might want to test some additional molecules not shown here.)

GASES
◀ A TORNADO is a violent, rotating column of air characterized by  
a funnel-shaped cloud. A tornado can be more than 3 km (2 mi)  
in diameter, with wind speeds approaching 500 km/hr.
