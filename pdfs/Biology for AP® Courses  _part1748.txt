ther on the bacterial chromosome. (The operon model
includes several components, so when studying how the operon works, it is helpful to refer to a diagram of the model.
See Figure 16.3 and Figure 16.4.) The operon includes a regulatory gene that codes for a repressor protein that binds to
the operator, which prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene(s) of interest. An example of this is seen in the
structural genes for lactose metabolism. However, if the repressor is inactivated, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter,
and transcription of the structural genes occurs.
There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: inducible control, repressible control, and activator control.

The lac operon is an example of inducible control because the presence of lactose “turns on” transcription of the genes
for its own metabolism. The trp operon is an example of repressible control because it uses proteins bound to the operator
sequence to ph
