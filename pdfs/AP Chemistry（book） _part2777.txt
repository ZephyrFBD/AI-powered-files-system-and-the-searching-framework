Amphoterism
Some metal oxides and hydroxides that are relatively insoluble in water dissolve 
in strongly acidic and strongly basic solutions. These substances, called ampho-
teric oxides and amphoteric hydroxides,* are soluble in strong acids and bases 
because they themselves are capable of behaving as either an acid or base. Examples 
of amphoteric substances include the oxides and hydroxides of Al3 +,  Cr3 +,  Zn2 +,  
and Sn2 +.
Like other metal oxides and hydroxides, amphoteric species dissolve in acidic solu-
tions because their anions, O2 - or OH-, react with acids. What makes amphoteric oxides 
and hydroxides special, though, is that they also dissolve in strongly basic solutions. This 
behavior results from the formation of complex anions containing several (typically 
four) hydroxides bound to the metal ion (Figure 17.20):
