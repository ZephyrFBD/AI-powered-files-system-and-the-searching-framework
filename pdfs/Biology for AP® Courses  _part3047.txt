Think About It
How does the unique structure of the neuron allow it to detect (and ultimately transmit) incoming signals?
Glia
While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually
outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that
are fulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their desti
