nts in order of increasing atomic number. 
Elements with similar properties are placed in vertical columns. 
The elements in a column are known as a group. The elements in a 
horizontal row are known as a period. The metallic elements (metals), 
which comprise the majority of the elements, dominate the left side 
and the middle of the table; the nonmetallic elements (nonmetals) are 
located on the upper right side. Many of the elements that lie along 
the line that separates metals from nonmetals are metalloids.
MOLECULES AND MOLECULAR COMPOUNDS (SECTION 2.6) 
 
Atoms can combine to form molecules. Compounds composed of 
molecules (molecular compounds) usually contain only nonmetallic 
elements. A molecule that contains two atoms is called a diatomic 
molecule. The composition of a substance is given by its chemical 
 
formula. A molecular substance can be represented by its empirical 
 
formula, which gives the relative numbers of atoms of each kind, but 
is usually represented by its
