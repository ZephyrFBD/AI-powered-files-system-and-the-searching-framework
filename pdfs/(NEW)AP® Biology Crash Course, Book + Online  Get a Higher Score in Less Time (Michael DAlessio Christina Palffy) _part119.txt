ariation that underlies phenotypic variation.
i.
A mutation in the regulatory parts of genes, such as a promoter, can affect when, where, and how
much of a protein is produced in different cells in a body.
ii. A mutation in a gene is important as a regulatory component in processes such as metabolism,
cell-to-cell communication, growth, development, etc., and can create significant differences
between individuals and between species.
iii. Mutations that alter the expression of proteins or their amino acid sequences can result in lack of a
protein or in a nonfunctional protein that may cause inherited diseases.
5. Lethal mutations—some germ cell mutations can include point mutations or the loss of parts of
chromosomes or whole chromosomes, and result in the death of an organism before birth.
6. Cancer—a combination of germ cell and somatic cell mutations are involved in the development of
cancer.
i.
Tumor cells undergo cell division much more often than normal cells because they lack co
