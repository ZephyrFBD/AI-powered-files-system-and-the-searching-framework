odents or large birds of
prey). (A), (C), and (D) all violate this narrowing principle, so they are
incorrect. Bioaccumulation is the process by which certain toxins build
up in animal tissue as they are ingested. Toxicants that bioaccumulate
are easily transferred to other organisms as they move up the food
chain because when one organism eats another, the consumer also
ingests all the toxicants stored in its food source. Since, as stated
previously, each organism must eat a greater amount of the organism
under it on the food chain to meet its energy needs, biomagnification
occurs, magnifying the toxicant concentration. Thus, if the large birds
of prey are at the top of this food pyramid, as is likely for such
organisms, then they would contain the highest concentrations of fat-
soluble toxins, as in (B).

The competitive exclusion principle, also known as Gause’s law, states
that if two species are competing for the same resource, the species
