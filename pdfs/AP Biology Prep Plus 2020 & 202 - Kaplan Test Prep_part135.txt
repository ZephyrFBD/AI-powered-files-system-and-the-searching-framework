rmines whether the protein will be sorted into
the secretory pathway starting at the rough ER or synthesized in the
cytoplasm. Proteins that are secreted will have only one hydrophobic
signal sequence, the signal peptide, and will be inserted into the ER
lumen when they are synthesized, then released from the cell later.
Proteins that are destined to be membrane bound have hydrophobic
transmembrane domains that are threaded through the rough ER
membrane as the protein is synthesized. When the protein reaches the
correct membrane destination along the secretory pathway, additional
signals in the protein sequence and structure will cause the protein to
stay localized at the current location.
Small regions of ER membrane bud oï¬€ to form small round membrane-
bound vesicles that contain newly synthesized proteins. These
cytoplasmic vesicles are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, which
is the next stop along the secretory pathway.
