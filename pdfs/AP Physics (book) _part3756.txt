 
after the Big Bang.
The lightest hadrons, the pions, soon disappeared, about 
after the Big Bang;
because they are the lightest mass hadrons (140 MeV), pions were the last hadrons
able to be created as the temperature (and average kinetic energy) dropped.
Lighter particles, including electrons and neutrinos, were the dominant form of
matter, and the universe entered the lepton era.
By the time the first full second had passed (clearly the most eventful second
in history!), the universe had cooled to about 10 billion degrees,
The
average kinetic energy was about 1 MeV. This was still sufficient energy to create
electrons and positrons and balance their annihilation reactions, since their
masses correspond to about 0.5 MeV. So there were about as many 
and 
as there were photons. But within a few more seconds, the temperature had
dropped sufficiently so that 
and 
could no longer be formed. Annihilation
continued. And, like nucleons before them, electrons and
positrons all but disappea
