Proton decay. An experiment uses 3300 tons
of water waiting to see a proton decay of the type
If the experi-
ment is run for 4 years without detecting a decay, estimate the lower limit on the
proton mean life.
APPROACH As with radioactive decay, the number of decays is proportional
to the number of parent species (N), the time interval 
and the decay
constant 
which is related to the mean life by (see Eqs. 30–3 and 30–7):
SOLUTION Dealing only with magnitudes, we solve for 
Thus for
(we don’t see even one decay) over the four-year trial,
where N is the number of protons in 3300 tons of water. To determine N, we note
that each molecule of 
contains 
protons. So one mole of water
contains 
protons in 18 g of
water (
of a kg), or about 
protons per kilogram. One
ton is 
so the 3300 tons contains 
Then our very rough estimate for a lower limit on the proton
mean life is
