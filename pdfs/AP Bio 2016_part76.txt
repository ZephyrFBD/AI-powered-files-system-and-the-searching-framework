38. Many human cells can be stimulated to divide by hormonelike growth factors that bind to receptor proteins (R)
on the plasma membrane and trigger an internal signal-transduction cascade. In many cases, however, the
process of contact inhibition prevents mitosis when cells are in direct contact with one another. Contact
inhibition occurs when proteins called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) interact, causing them to change shape
so that the growth-factor signaling proteins that normally associate with CAMs are replaced by another protein,
called M. Both pathways are depicted in the figures below.
Which of the following statements accurately uses the information presented to support the hypothesis that 
interruption of M function in a single body cell can result in cancer? 
(A) Protein 3
