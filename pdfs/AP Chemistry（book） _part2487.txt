 15.66 Methanol 1CH3OH2 can be made by the reaction of CO 
with H2:
CO1g2 + 2 H21g2 ∆ CH3OH1g2
 
 (a) Use thermochemical data in Appendix C to calculate 
∆H° for this reaction. (b) To maximize the equilibrium 
yield of methanol, would you use a high or low tempera-
ture? (c) To maximize the equilibrium yield of methanol, 
would you use a high or low pressure?
 15.67 Ozone, O3, decomposes to molecular oxygen in the strato-
sphere according to the reaction 2 O31g2 ¡ 3 O21g2. 
Would an increase in pressure favor the formation of 
ozone or of oxygen?
 15.68 The water–gas shift reaction CO1g2 + H2O1g2 ∆
CO21g2 + H21g2 is used industrially to produce hydrogen. 
The reaction enthalpy is ∆H° = -41 kJ. (a) To increase the 
equilibrium yield of hydrogen would you use high or low 
temperature? (b) Could you increase the equilibrium yield 
of hydrogen by controlling the pressure of this reaction? If 
so would high or low pressure favor formation of H21g2?
