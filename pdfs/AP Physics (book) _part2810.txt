the minus sign in Eq. 23–9 which only tells us that the image is inverted. We set

The eyepiece acts like a simple magnifier. If we assume that
the eye is relaxed, the eyepiece angular magnification

the image formed by the objective, the overall angular magnification M is the
product of the magnification of the objective lens,
