Treatment Group 1: I constructed three respirometers and
labeled them, as shown in the figure below.
The first respirometer contained germinating (respiring) peas.
The second respirometer contained non-germinating peas. Since
the volume of the non-germinating peas is smaller than the
volume of the germinating peas, I added glass beads to the
second respirometer to make the total volume in the tube with
the non-germinating peas the same as the total volume in the
tube with the germinating peas. In addition, because I
introduced glass beads into the experiment, I also included a
third respirometer that was only filled with glass beads to
control for the possibility that they somehow use air. The
respirometer with the germinating peas was the experimental,
whereas the apparatuses with the non-germinating peas and the
glass beads only were the controls. (Note that I placed
