An antiparticle has the same mass as a particle but opposite
charge. Certain other properties may also be opposite: for
example, the antiproton has baryon number (nucleon number)
opposite 
to that for the proton 
.
In all nuclear and particle reactions, the following conser-
vation laws hold: momentum, angular momentum, mass–energy,
electric charge, baryon number, and lepton numbers.
Certain particles have a property called strangeness,
which is conserved by the strong force but not by the weak
force. The properties charm, bottom, and top also are con-
served by the strong force but not by the weak force.

Just as the electromagnetic force can be said to be due to
an exchange of photons, the strong nuclear force is carried by
massless gluons. The W and Z particles carry the weak force.
These fundamental force carriers (photon, W and Z, gluons)
are called gauge bosons.
