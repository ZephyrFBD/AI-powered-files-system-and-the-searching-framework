In 1896 the French scientist Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) discovered that a compound 
of uranium spontaneously emits high-energy radiation. This spontaneous emission of 
radiation is called radioactivity. At Becquerel’s suggestion, Marie Curie (Figure 2.6) and 
her husband, Pierre, began experiments to identify and isolate the source of radioactivity 
in the compound. They concluded that it was the uranium atoms.
Further study of radioactivity, principally by the British scientist Ernest Rutherford, 
revealed three types of radiation: alpha 1a2, beta 1b2, and gamma 1g2. Rutherford (1871–
1937) was a very important figure in this period of atomic science. After working at Cam-
bridge University with J. J. Thomson, he moved to McGill University in Montreal, where 
he did research on radioactivity that led to his 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1907
