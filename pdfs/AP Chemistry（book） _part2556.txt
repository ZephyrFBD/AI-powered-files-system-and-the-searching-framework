Notice that we have neglected the very small con-
centration of H+1aq2 due to H2O autoionization. 
Notice also that the amount of HCOOH that 
ionizes is very small compared with the initial con-
centration of the acid. To the number of significant 
figures we are using, the subtraction yields 0.10 M:
10.10 - 4.2 * 10-32 M ≃ 0.10 M
We can now insert the equilibrium concentrations 
into the expression for Ka:
Ka =

= 1.8 * 10-4

Niacin, one of the B vitamins, 
has the molecular structure 
shown at the right. A 0.020 M 
solution of niacin has a pH of 
3.26. What is the acid-dissocia-
tion constant for niacin?

Percent Ionization
We have seen that the magnitude of Ka indicates the strength of a weak acid. Another 
measure of acid strength is percent ionization, defined as
