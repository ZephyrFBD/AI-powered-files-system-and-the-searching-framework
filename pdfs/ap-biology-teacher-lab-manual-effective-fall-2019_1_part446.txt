  Sand 
• Dissection scissors 
•  Ethanol 
• Slides, cover slips 
•  Glacial acetic acid (17.4 M) 
• Scientific cleaning wipes 
•  Hydrochloric acid (12 M) 
• Coplin jars 
•  Carbol-fuschin (Ziehl-Neelson) stain 
• Petri dish 
•  Lectin (phytohemagglutinin PHA-M 
from 
 Phaseolus vulgaris)  
• Disposable gloves  
•  Compound microscopes 
Lectin: Dissolve 10 mg lectin in 200 mL H2O. Exposure to the lectin may cause  
irritation; wear gloves and weigh the lectin in a fume hood.  
Carnoy’s fixative: 125 mL glacial acetic acid mixed with 375 mL 95% ethanol 
You may treat the bulbs ahead of time and have your students prepare the chromosome 
squash slides. In this manner, they will not know which bulbs are treated with lectin and 
which ones are the controls. Treat the slides (Coplin jar) and the cover slips (dish) with 
70% ethanol. 
Preparing the Onion Root Tips 
1. Fill two jars with 1.5 cm of fine sand. Label one jar “control”   
and the other “lectin.”  
2. Wet the sand in the control
