Questions 9 and 10
The respiration rate (as measured by oxygen consumption per gram of body weight per minute) was measured in
rats, grasshoppers, and newly discovered species animal X. The respiration rates were measured at 5째C and 30째C for
all three species. Data are shown in the table.
Organism
Average Respiration Rate at 5째C (mL O2/min/g)
Average Respiration Rate at 30째C (mL O2/min/g)
Rat
0.158
0.076
Grasshopper
0.011
0.033
Species X
0.024
0.069
9. Which of the following conclusions about species X is best supported by the data?
(A) Species X is ectothermic since its respiration rate is higher at a higher environmental temperature.
(B) Species X is ectothermic since ectothermic animals always have an increased res
