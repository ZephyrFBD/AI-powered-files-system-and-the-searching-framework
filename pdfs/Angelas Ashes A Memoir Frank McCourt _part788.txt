om the horrors of birth 
 
 control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to 
 
 do with John O’London’s Weekly. 
 
 Monday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines 
 
 and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there’s 
 
 any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O’London’s 
 
 Weekly.They’re all rich-looking people, some in motor cars, men with 
 
 hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women 
 
 with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who 
 
  
  
 have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to 
 
 show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about 
 
 birth control. 
 
 Eamon told me early in the day, Don’t sell the bloody page for less 
 
 349 
 
 than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn’t. Everyone 
 
 in Limerick is talking about this page and they’re dying to get their 
 
 hands on it.
