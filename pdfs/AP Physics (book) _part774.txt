42. (III) A pendulum consists of a mass M hanging at the bottom
end of a massless rod of length 
which has a frictionless
pivot at its top end. A mass m,
moving as shown in Fig. 7–35
with velocity v, impacts M
and becomes embedded. What
is the smallest value of v
sufficient to cause the pendulum
(with embedded mass m) to
swing clear over the top of its
arc?

*47. (III) An atomic nucleus of mass m traveling with speed v
collides elastically with a target particle of mass 2m (ini-
tially at rest) and is scattered at 90°. (a) At what angle does
the target particle move after the collision? (b) What are
the final speeds of the two particles? (c) What fraction of the
initial kinetic energy is transferred to the target particle?
*48. (III) A neon atom  
makes a perfectly elastic
collision with another atom at rest. After the impact, the
neon atom tra
