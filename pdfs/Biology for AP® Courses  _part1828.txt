CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
24. Which best distinguishes prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells?
a.
Prokaryotes possess a nucleus whereas
eukaryotes do not, but eukaryotes show greater
compartmentalization that allows for greater
regulation of gene expression.
b.
Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus whereas
prokaryotes do not, and eukaryotes show greater
compartmentalization that allows for greater
regulation of gene expression.
c.
Prokaryotic cells are less complex and perform
highly-regulated gene expression whereas
eukaryotes perform less-regulated gene
expression.
d.
Eukaryotic cells are more complex and perform
less-regulated gene expression whe
