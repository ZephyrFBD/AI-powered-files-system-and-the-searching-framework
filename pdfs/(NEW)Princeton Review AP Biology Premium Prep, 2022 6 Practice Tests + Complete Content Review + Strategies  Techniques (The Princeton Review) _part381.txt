In contrast, sometimes animals have features with the same function but that are structurally
different. A bat’s wing and an insect’s wing, for example, are both used to fly. They therefore
have the same function, but they have evolved totally independently of one another. These are
called analogous structures. Another classic example of an analogous structure is the eye.
Though scallops, insects, and humans all have eyes, these three different types of eyes are thought
to have evolved entirely independently of one another. They are therefore analogous structures.
Molecular Biology: Perhaps the most compelling proof of all is the similarity at the
molecular level. Today, scientists can examine nucleotide and amino acid sequences of
different organisms. From these analyses, we’ve discovered that organisms that are closely
related have a greater proportion of sequences in common than distantly related species. For
example, humans don’t look much like chimpanzees. However, by some esti
