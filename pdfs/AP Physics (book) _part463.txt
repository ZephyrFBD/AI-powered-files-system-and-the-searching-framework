The ball makes 2.00 revolutions in a second. What is its 
centripetal acceleration?
APPROACH The centripetal acceleration is  
We are given r, and we
can find the speed of the ball, v, from the given radius and frequency.
SOLUTION If the ball makes 2.00 complete revolutions per second, then the
ball travels in a complete circle in a time interval equal to 0.500 s, which is its
period T. The distance traveled in this time is the circumference of the circle,
where r is the radius of the circle. Therefore, the ball has speed
The centripetal acceleration† is
EXERCISE A In Example 5–1, if the radius is doubled to 1.20 m, but the period stays 
the same, the centripetal acceleration will change by a factor of:
(a) 2; (b) 4; (c) 
(d) 
(e) none of these.
