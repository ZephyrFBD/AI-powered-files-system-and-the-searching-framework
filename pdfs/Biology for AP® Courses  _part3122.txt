trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) provide clues as to what happens to an individual with this
disease. “Amyotrophic” means “no muscle nourishment,” “lateral” refers to the part of the spine that tells muscles what
to do, and “sclerosis” indicates that the lateral portion of the spine that controls muscle movement hardens. Explain
how ALS causes a decline in voluntary muscle control over time.
a.
ALS degenerates sensory neurons that control voluntary muscle movement. As the lateral portion of the
spine that controls muscle movement hardens, signals are no longer sent to muscles. Initially, muscles
weaken but coordination is not effected, and eventually paralysis occurs.
b.
ALS degenerates motor neurons that control voluntary muscle movement. As the lateral portion of the spine
that controls muscle movement hardens, signals are no longer sent to muscles. Initially, muscles strengthen
and coordination is effected, and eventually paralysis occurs.
c.
ALS degenerates sensory neurons that cont
