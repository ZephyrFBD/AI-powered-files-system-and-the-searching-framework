c plant Elodea or the moss Mnium. The most prominent features of
a plant cell are the cell wall and the chloroplasts. You may also see the nucleus. The central vacuole will be apparent
because of what you donâ€™t see: Much of the cell appears empty because it is occupied by the central vacuole, which
contains colorless water and solutes.
Second, you use a microscope to observe the effect of osmosis on a plant cell as it responds to one of the four
solutions used in part II (sucrose, NaCl, glucose, or ovalbumin). The solution you use creates one of three
environmental treatments:
1. When the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic (higher solute concentration) relative to the contents of the
cell, the net movement of water is out of the cell, cell turgor decreases, and the plasma membrane collapses. This is
called plasmolysis and can be identified when the cell, viewed under a microscope, appears to shrivel, leaving a gap
between the cell contents and the cell wall.
2. When the soluti
