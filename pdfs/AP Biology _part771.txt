Positive feedback in the menstrual cycle: Positive feedback
enhances a process until it is completed. During the follicular
phase, the estrogen that is released from the follicle stimulates the
release of LH from the anterior pituitary. The increase in LH
stimulates the follicle to release even more estrogen. The hormone
levels continue to rise until the follicle matures and ovulation
occurs.
Negative feedback in the menstrual cycle: Negative feedback
stops a process once homeostasis is reached. During the luteal
phase, LH stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete estrogen and
progesterone. Once the levels of estrogen and progesterone reach
sufficiently high levels, they trigger the hypothalamus and
pituitary to shut off, thereby inhibiting the secretion of LH and
FSH.
REMEMBER
Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal environment and respond to
external environmental cues.
