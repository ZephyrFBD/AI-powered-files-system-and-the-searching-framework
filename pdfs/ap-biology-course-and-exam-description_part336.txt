Question 1: Interpreting and Evaluating Experimental Results
In many countries, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting the parasite that causes malaria to people 
through their bites. A primary tool for mosquito control is the use of insecticidal nets sprayed with chemicals known as 
pyrethroids, which are relatively safe for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However, mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has 
now become widespread. Pyrethroids interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells of the 
mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino 
acid position 1014. Scientists hypothesize that this muta
