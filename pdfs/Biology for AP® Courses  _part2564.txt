unction and presence
of cell organelles among prokaryotes and eukaryotes?
a.
Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis
found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Cell
wall is a protective layer, typical in prokaryotic
cells and in some eukaryotes. Chromosomal
DNA, the genetic material of the cell is present
in a nucleoid region in prokaryotes while
enclosed in a nucleus in eukaryotes.
