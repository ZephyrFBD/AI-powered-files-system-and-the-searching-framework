 bat with WNS is most
likely half of that of a healthy M. lucifugus bat.
(d) Justify your prediction. (1 point)
Justification (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Since bats with WNS use energy twice as fast as healthy bats, they will
deplete their body fat reserve twice as quickly. Thus, the body fat content
of a M. lucifugus bat with WNS is mostly likely half of that of a
healthy M. lucifugus bat
Body fat of a healthy M. lucifugus bat is twice that of a M. lucifugus bat with WNS.
Bats with WNS use energy twice as fast as healthy bats.

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The logistic model shows the limited increase in population size over a
given time. For 
, N is the size of the original
population, r is the rate of population growth, and K is the carrying
capacity.
