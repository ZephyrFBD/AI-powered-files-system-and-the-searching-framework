exchange to occur, eliminating (A) and (C). Tight junctions bind cells
together so tightly that a total barrier to transport and diﬀusion occurs
in areas where they exist. They prevent molecules from going where
they do not belong. Thus, (B) is also incorrect.

The presence of selective pressures, such as predators, diseases, and
environmental threats, impacts which signaling pathway cells choose.
If the selective pressure is neutral, the current signal transduction
pathway will continue since the resulting population is already
capable of survival. However, if the selective pressure is not neutral,
the species will experience natural selection for specific phenotypes,
adapting to meet the new challenges. In a normal cell, apoptosis is
prevented by inhibiting the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and
increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. However, when a
cell undergoes excessive DNA damage and is unable to repair it
suﬀiciently, the opposi
