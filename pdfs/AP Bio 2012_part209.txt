protein 
is in the nucleus. The student would elaborate that the 
protein would function as a transcription factor or in DNA 
packaging in chromosomes.

Attached ribosome (location and function): 
The student is able to explain in a paragraph how a protein 
produced on the attached ribosome may ultimately end up 
as a secretory protein excreted from the cell for further use 
by another cell; however, the student will not go into further 
details. The student may also say that the protein may end 
up embedded in the cell membrane as an integral protein or 
as a peripheral protein. The student states that this receptor 
protein contributes to the structure of the cell membrane but 
will not provide additional details. The student may mention 
that the secretory proteins may also be found in transport 
vesicles for further processing in the Golgi apparatus or 
to other components of the endomembrane system. The 
student may mention that pro
