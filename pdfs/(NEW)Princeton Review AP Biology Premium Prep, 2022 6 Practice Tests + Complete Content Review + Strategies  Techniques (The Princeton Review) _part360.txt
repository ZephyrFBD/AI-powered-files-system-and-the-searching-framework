easing new viruses into the
environment. In the lysogenic cycle, the virus incorporates itself into the host genome and remains dormant until it
is triggered to switch into the lytic cycle. A virus can hide in the genome of a host cell for a very long time. During
this time, the cell may divide and replicate the virus as well. By the time the lytic cycle is triggered, the virus may
have been replicated many many times as the cell hosting it divides.
When a virus excises from a host genome (becomes unintegrated), it sometimes accidentally takes some of the
bacterial cellâ€™s DNA with it. Then, the host DNA accidentally gets packaged into new viral particles with the viral
genome. The next cell that gets infected is not only getting infected with the viral genome, but also with that stolen
chunk of bacterial DNA. If that chunk held a gene for something like antibiotic resistance, the next cell that gets
infected will gain that trait. The transfer of DNA between bacterial cells using a lyso
