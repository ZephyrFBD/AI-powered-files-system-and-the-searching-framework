 holes into the
valence band, and before the electrons have time to combine with holes, they
form an inverted population. When one electron drops down into a hole and
emits a photon, that photon stimulates other electrons to drop down as well,
in phase, creating coherent laser light. Opposite ends of the crystal are made 
parallel and very smooth so they act as the mirrors needed for lasing, as shown 
in our laser diagram, Fig. 28–18.
