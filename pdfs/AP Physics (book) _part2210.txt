he reverse of part (a). Indeed, the direction of the emf in the
Hall effect first revealed that it is negative particles that move in metal conductors,
and that positive “holes” move in p-type semiconductors.
Because the Hall emf is proportional to B, the Hall effect can be used to
measure magnetic fields. A device to do so is called a Hall probe. When B is
known, the Hall emf can be used to determine the drift velocity of charge 
carriers.

20–5 Magnetic Field Due to a 
Long Straight Wire
We saw in Section 20–2, Fig. 20–8, that the magnetic field lines due to the 
electric current in a long straight wire form circles with the wire at the center
(Fig. 20–22). You might expect that the field strength at a given point would 
be greater if the current flowing in the wire were greater; and that the field 
would be less at points farther from the wire. This is indeed the case. Careful
experiments show that the m
