imals with true legs and lungs are found in rocks that 
are approximately 363 million years old. 
  Three samples of rocks are available that might contain fossils of a transitional species between lobe-finned 
fishes and amphibians: one rock sample that is 350 million years old, one that is 370 million years old, and one 
that is 390 million years old. 
(a) Select the most appropriate sample of rocks in which to search for a transitional species between lobe-finned 
fishes and amphibians. Justify your selection. 
(b) Describe TWO pieces of evidence provided by fossils of a transitional species that would support a 
hypothesis that amphibians evolved from lobe-finned fishes.
