 means to begin viral classification (Figure 21.4).
Figure 21.4 Viruses can be either complex in shape or relatively simple. This figure shows three relatively
complex virions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells;
adenovirus, which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to host cells; and HIV, which uses glycoproteins embedded
in its envelope to bind to host cells. Notice that HIV has proteins called matrix proteins, internal to the envelope,
which help stabilize virion shape. (credit “bacteriophage, adenovirus”: modification of work by NCBI, NIH; credit

Which of the following statements about viral structure is true?
a.
Viruses are very similar in structure.
b.
The capsomere is made up of small protein subunits called capsids.
c.
DNA is the genetic material in all viruses.
d.
Glycoproteins help the virus attach to the host cell.
