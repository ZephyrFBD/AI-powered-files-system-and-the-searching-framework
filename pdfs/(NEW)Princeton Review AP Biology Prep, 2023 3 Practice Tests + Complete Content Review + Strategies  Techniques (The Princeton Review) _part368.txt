ey move through the gel. Restriction enzymes are also used to create a
molecular fingerprint. The patterns created after cutting with restriction enzymes are unique for each person because
each personâ€™s DNA is slightly different. Some people might have sequences that are cut many times, resulting in
many tiny fragments, and others might have sequences that are cut infrequently, producing a few large fragments.
When restriction fragments between individuals of the same species are compared, the fragments differ in length
because of polymorphisms, which are slight differences in DNA sequences. These fragments are called restriction
fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs. In DNA fingerprinting, RFLPs produced from DNA left at a crime
scene are compared to RFLPs from the DNA of suspects.
DNA Sequencing
An important tool of modern scientists is the process of DNA sequencing. This allows scientists to determine the
order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. By knowing this, scientists could de
