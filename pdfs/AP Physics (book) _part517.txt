FIGURE 5;28 Kepler’s first law.
An ellipse is a closed curve such 
that the sum of the distances from
any point P on the curve to two 
fixed points (called the foci,
and
) remains constant. That is, the
sum of the distances,
is
the same for all points on the curve.
A circle is a special case of an 
ellipse in which the two foci 
coincide, at the center of the circle.

Where is Mars? Mars’ period (its “year”) was noted by
Kepler to be about 687 days (Earth days), which is
(Earth years). Determine the mean distance of Mars from the Sun using the
Earth as a reference.
APPROACH We are given the ratio of the periods of Mars and Earth. We can
find the distance from Mars to the Sun using Kepler’s third law, given the
Earth–Sun distance as
(Table 5–2; also Table inside front cover).
SOLUTION Let the distance of Mars from the Sun be 
and the Earth–Sun
distance be
