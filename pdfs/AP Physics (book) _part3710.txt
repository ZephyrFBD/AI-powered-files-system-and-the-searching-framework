 mass and gravitational mass. (For
example, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same acceleration, g,
on Earth.) This is another way to state the equivalence principle: gravitational mass
is equivalent to inertial mass.

FIGURE 33–13 (a) Light beam goes straight
across an elevator which is not accelerating.
(b) The light beam bends (exaggerated) according
to an observer in an accelerating elevator whose
speed increases in the upward direction.

The principle of equivalence can be used to show that light ought to be
deflected by the gravitational force due to a massive object. Consider another
thought experiment, in which an elevator is in free space where virtually no
gravity acts. If a light beam is emitted by a flashlight attached to the side of the
elevator, the beam travels straight across the elevator and makes a spot on the
opposite
