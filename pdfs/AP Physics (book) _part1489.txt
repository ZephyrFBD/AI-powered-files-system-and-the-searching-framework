45. (I) By what factor will the rms speed of gas molecules
increase if the temperature is increased from 20°C to 160°C?
46. (I) A gas is at 20°C. To what temperature must it be raised
to triple the rms speed of its molecules?
47. (I) What speed would a 1.0-g paper clip have if it had the
same kinetic energy as a molecule at 22°C?
48. (II) The rms speed of molecules in a gas at 20.0°C is to be
increased by 4.0%. To what temperature must it be raised?
49. (II) If the pressure in a gas is tripled while its volume is
held constant, by what facto
