75. Three radioactive sources have the same activity, 35 mCi.
Source A emits 1.0-MeV 
rays, source B emits 2.0-MeV 
rays, and source C emits 2.0-MeV alphas. What is the
relative danger of these sources?

76. A 55-kg patient is to be given a medical test involving the
ingestion of 
(Section 31–7) which decays by emitting
a 140-keV gamma. The half-life for this decay is 6 hours.
Assuming that about half the gamma photons exit the body
without interacting with anything, what must be the initial
activity of the Tc sample if the whole-body dose cannot
exceed 50 mrem? Make the rough approximation that
biological elimination of Tc can be ignored.

must be overcome to make a functioning fission nuclear
reactor; (b) state three environmental problems or dangers
that do or could result from the operation of a nuclear
fission
