A signal voltage, on the other hand, is a voltage intended to affect something
else. A signal voltage varies in time and can also be very brief. For example,
a sound such as a pure tone, which may be sinusoidal as we discussed in 
Chapters 11 and 12 (see Figs. 11–24 and 12–14), will produce an output voltage
from a high quality microphone that is also sinusoidal. That signal voltage is
amplified and reaches a loudspeaker, making it produce the sound we hear.
Signal voltages (see Fig. 17–22) are sometimes a simple pulse (as in Figs. 11–23
and 11–33), and often act to change some aspect of an electronic device.
Signal voltages are sent to cell phones (“I’ve got signal”), to computers from
the Internet, or to TV sets with the information on the picture and sound. Not long
ago, signal voltages were analog—the voltage varied continuously, as in Fig. 17–22.
Today, television and computer signals are digital and use a binary number
system to represent a numerical value. In a normal number
