es (a) divided by the total number of possible cases (n).
P = 
This can be determined experimentally by observation (such as when population data is being collected) or by the
nature of the event. For example, the probability of getting a two when rolling a die is 1/6, since there are six sides
on a die.
Example: What is the probability of drawing the nine of hearts from a deck of cards?
Solution: Since there are 52 cards in a deck and this question is asking about one particular card, P = 1/52.
Combining Probabilities
Many genetics problems involve several probabilities, all being considered together to answer a larger biological
question. There are three rules that are often used.
Product Rule
The product rule is used for independent events and is also called the “AND rule.” The probability of independent
events occurring together is the product of their separate probabilities. This rule is used when the order of the events
matters.
Example: What is the probability of drawing a heart
