Figure 18.25 In (a) gradual speciation, species diverge at a slow, steady pace as traits change incrementally. In
(b) punctuated equilibrium, species diverge quickly and then remain unchanged for long periods of time.
Describe a situation in which punctuated equilibrium is more likely to take place.
a.
There is a significant change in the environment over time, such as the breakup of a supercontinent due to
tectonic activity.
b.
A species that has a competitor outcompetes it and drives it to extinction, freeing up more resources.
c.
There is a sudden and significant change in the environment, s
