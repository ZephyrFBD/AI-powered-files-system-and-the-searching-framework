rief
description of the role of each modification in either
regulating oxygen or synthesizing ammonia.
The Krebs cycle in prokaryotes and eukaryotes differs. In
prokaryotes, the Krebs cycle occurs in the cytoplasm and
the intermediate 2-oxoglutarate (?-ketoglutarate) is absent.
C. Construct a representation of the regulation of genes
encoding the nitrogen fixation system using the elements
below. The irregular shapes are either metabolites or
transcription factors, NtcA, HetR, and PatS. In your
representation, label each shape using the names on the
left in the figure below. Your representation must account
for these observations:
•
when nitrogen is limiting, 2-oxoglutarate
concentration in the cytoplasm increases
•
HetR is transcribed when 2-oxoglutarate
concentrations are low
•
PatS is transcribed when 2-oxoglutarate
concentrations are low
•
nitrogenase is transcribed when HetR concentrations
are high and PatS concentrations are low
•
when PatS concentrations are high, nifX genes are
