ive species concerns the growth of Asian carp populations.
Asian carp were introduced to the United States in the 1970s by fisheries and sewage treatment facilities
that used the fishâ€™s excellent filter feeding capabilities to clean their ponds of excess plankton. Some of
the fish escaped, however, and by the 1980s they had colonized many waterways of the Mississippi River
basin, including the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.
Voracious eaters and rapid reproducers, Asian carp may outcompete native species for food, potentially
leading to their extinction. For example, black carp are voracious eaters of native mussels and snails,
limiting this food source for native fish species. Silver carp eat plankton that native mussels and snails
feed on, reducing this food source by a different alteration of the food web. In some areas of the
Mississippi River, Asian carp species have become the most predominant, effectively outcompeting native
fishes for habitat. In some parts of the Illinois River,
