and similarities between food chains and food webs? How are both used to describe an
ecosystem with respect to the movement of matter and energy through the ecosystem?
37.2 | Energy Flow through Ecosystems
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How do organisms acquire energy in a food web and associated food chains?
•
How does the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels affect ecosystem structure and dynamics?
•
What are the characteristics of each trophic level in an ecosystem, and how can ecological pyramids be used to
model them?
Connection for AP® Courses
As we learned when we explored concepts in earlier chapters, all living organisms require energy in one form or another,
usually ATP, to carry out cellular processes. It is important to understand how organisms in an ecosystem acquire free
energy and how that energy is passed among organisms through food webs and their constituent food chains. Energy takes
a one-way path through ecosystems becau
