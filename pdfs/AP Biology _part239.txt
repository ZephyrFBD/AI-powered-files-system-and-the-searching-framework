synthesis, no sugar is formed.
Instead, peroxisomes break down the products of photorespiration. If
photorespiration does not produce any useful products, why do plants
carry it out at all? This process is probably a vestige from ancient Earth
billions of years ago when the atmosphere had little or no free oxygen to
divert rubisco and sugar production.
MODIFICATIONS FOR DRY ENVIRONMENTS
C-4 photosynthesis is a modification for dry environments. C-4 plants
exhibit modified anatomy and biochemical pathways that enable them to
minimize excess water loss and maximize sugar production. As a result, C-
4 plants thrive in hot and sunny environments where C-3 plants (see Figure
7.9) would wilt and die. Examples of C-4 plants are corn, sugar cane, and
crabgrass. In C-4 plants, a series of steps precedes the Calvin cycle. These
steps pump CO2 entering the leaf away from the air spaces and deep into
the leaf.
