ion but have another primary function. The heart produces the
hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, which functions to reduce blood volume, pressure, and Na+ concentration. The
gastrointestinal tract produces various hormones that aid in digestion. The kidneys produce renin, calcitriol, and
erythropoietin. Adipose tissue produces leptin, which promotes satiety signals in the brain.
