atures may cause polar ice caps to melt and
flooding to occur. Other potential effects of global warming include changes in precipitation patterns, changes
in plant and animal populations, and detrimental changes in agriculture.
Ozone depletion: Pollution has also led to depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer by such chemicals as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are used in aerosol cans. Ozone (O3) forms when UV radiation reacts with
O2. Ozone protects Earthâ€™s surface from excessive ultraviolet radiation. Its loss could have major genetic effects
and could increase incidence of cancer.
Acid rain: Burning fossil fuels produces pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. When these
compounds react with droplets of atmospheric water in clouds, they form sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively.
The rain that falls from these clouds is weakly acidic and is called acid rain. Acid rain lowers the pH of aquatic
ecosystems and soil, which damages water systems, plants, and soil.
