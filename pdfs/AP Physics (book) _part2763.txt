is magnifying part of
page 722 of this Chapter, which
describes how the magnifying glass
works according to the ray model.
In this Chapter we examine film
and digital cameras, the human
eye, eyeglasses, telescopes, and
microscopes as well as image
resolution, X-rays, and CT scans.
Film contains a thin emulsion (
a coating) with light-sensitive chemicals that
change when light strikes them. The film is then developed by chemicals dissolved
in water, which causes the most changed areas (brightest light) to turn opaque,
so the image is recorded on the film.† We might call film “chemical photography”
as compared to digital, which is electronic.
Digital Cameras, Electronic Sensors (CCD, CMOS)
In a digital camera, the film is replaced by a semiconductor sensor. Two types are
common: CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal oxide
semiconductor). A CCD sensor is made up of millions of tiny semiconductor pixels
(“picture elements”)—see Fig.24–49. A 12-MP (12-megapixel) sensor m
