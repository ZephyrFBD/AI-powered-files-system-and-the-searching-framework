p 5 At 5-minute intervals, mark the position of the manometer fluid for each capillary 
tube. Be sure to mark the bottom edge of the fluid plug. Continue marking the positions 
until the fluid in the microrespirometers has traveled the entire length of the capillary, or 
until 25 minutes have passed. 
Step 6 At the end of 25 minutes, remove the microrespirometers from the water bath. Use 
a centimeter ruler to measure the distance from the initial mark (Time 0 mark) to each 
of the 5-minute intervals marked on each capillary tube. Record your measurements in 
the correct column of your data table. 
Step 7 Calculate the change in fluid position during each time interval. To do this, 
subtract the fluid position at the beginning of the time interval from the fluid position at 
the end of the time interval. Record your values. 
Step 8 Repeat the calculations for your control microrespirometer. 
Step 9 Using the values you obtained for the control microrespirometer, correct for any 
change
