Decay chain. In the decay chain of
Fig. 30–11, if we look at the decay of 
we see four successive nuclides with
half-lives of 250,000 yr, 75,000 yr, 1600 yr, and a little under 4 days. Each decay
in the chain has an alpha particle of a characteristic energy, and so we can 
monitor the radioactive decay rate of each nuclide. Given a sample that was 
pure 
a million years ago, which alpha decay would you expect to have the
highest activity rate in the sample?
RESPONSE The first instinct is to say that the process with the shortest half-
life would show the highest activity. Surprisingly, perhaps, the activities of the
four nuclides in this sample are all the same. The reason is that in each case the
