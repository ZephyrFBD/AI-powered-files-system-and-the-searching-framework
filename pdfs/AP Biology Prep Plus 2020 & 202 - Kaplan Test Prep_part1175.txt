 nutrients in the form of sugars. 
(b) Identify the control group in the experiment. (2 points)
Identification (2 points)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Plants live in symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi
Their relationship is mutualistic because both organisms benefit
No treatment + isolated
The use of fungicide and the presence of neighboring plants are being studied,
so they are the independent variables. The group that does not receive
treatment is the control group. Thus, the results of no treatment + isolated
are a baseline to which the results of the other groups will be compared.
(c) Determine the eﬀect fungicide and the presence of neighbors have on
shoot biomass. (2 points)
Determination (2 points)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
According to Figure 2, the lengths of the white and gray bars, which
represent the use of fungicide (treatment), are shorter than those of the
striped and black bars, which represent no treatment w
