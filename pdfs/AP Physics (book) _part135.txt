When specifying the motion of an object, it is important to specify not only
the speed but also the direction of motion. Often we can specify a direction by
using north, east, south, and west, and by “up” and “down.” In physics, we
often draw a set of coordinate axes, as shown in Fig. 2–3, to represent a frame
of reference. We can always place the origin 0, and the directions of the x and
y axes, as we like for convenience. The x and y axes are always perpendicular
to each other. The origin is where
Objects positioned to the right
of the origin of coordinates (0) on the x axis have an x coordinate which we
almost always choose to be positive; then points to the left of 0 have a negative
x coordinate. The position along the y axis is usually considered positive when
above 0, and negative when below 0, although the reverse convention can be used
if convenient. An
