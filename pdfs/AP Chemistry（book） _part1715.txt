n that of neopentane. The differ-
ence can be traced to the different shapes of the two molecules. Intermolecular attrac-
tion is greater for n-pentane because the molecules can come in contact over the entire 
length of the long, somewhat cylindrical molecules. Less contact is possible between the 
more compact and nearly spherical neopentane molecules.
Dipole–Dipole Interactions
The presence of a permanent dipole moment in polar molecules gives rise to dipole–
dipole interactions. These interactions originate from electrostatic attractions 
between the partially positive end of one molecule and the partially negative end of a 
neighboring molecule. Repulsions can also occur when the positive (or negative) ends of 
two molecules are in close proximity. Dipole–dipole interactions are effective only when 
molecules are very close together.
To see the effect of dipole–dipole interactions, we compare the boiling points of two 
compounds of similar molecular weight: acetonitrile 1CH3CN, MW
