bjects. Until now, when-
ever we have dealt with the motion of an extended object (that is, an object that
has size), we have assumed that it could be approximated as a point particle or
that it undergoes only translational motion. Real extended objects, however, can
undergo rotational and other types of motion as well. For example, the diver 
in Fig. 7–20a undergoes only translational motion (all parts of the object follow
the same path), whereas the diver in Fig. 7–20b undergoes both translational 
and rotational motion. We will refer to motion that is not pure translation as 
general motion.
Observations indicate that even if an object rotates, or several parts of a
system of objects move relative to one another, there is one point that moves in
the same path that a particle would move if subjected to the same net force.
This point is called the center of mass (abbreviated CM). The general motion of
an extended object (or system of objects) can be considered as the sum of the
transl
