nd in the nucleus of an atom; protons and 
neutrons. (Section 21.1)
nucleotide Monomers of nucleic acids formed from a five-
carbon sugar, a nitrogen-containing organic base, and a 
phosphate group. Nucleotides form linear polymers called 
DNA and RNA, which are involved in protein synthesis and cell 
reproduction. (Section 24.10)
nucleus The very small, very dense, positively charged 
portion of an atom; it is composed of protons and neutrons. 
(Section 2.2)
octet rule A rule stating that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share 
electrons until they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. 
(Section 8.1)
optical isomerism A form of isomerism in which the two forms 
of a compound (stereoisomers) are nonsuperimposable mirror 
images. Also called enantiomers. (Section 23.4)
optically active Possessing the ability to rotate the plane of 
polarized light. (Section 23.4)
orbital An allowed energy state of an electron in the quantum-
mechanical model of the atom; the term orbital is also used t
