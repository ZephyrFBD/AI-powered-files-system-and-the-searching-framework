d you 
expect to have a partial negative charge in the ClO mole-
cule? (c) Using formal charges as a guide, propose the dom-
inant Lewis structure for the molecule. (d) The anion ClO- 
exists. What is the formal charge on the Cl for the best Lewis 
structure for ClO-?
 [8.87] (a) Using the electronegativities of Br and Cl, estimate the 
partial charges on the atoms in the Br¬ Cl molecule. (b) Us-
ing these partial charges and the atomic radii given in Fig-
ure 7.8, estimate the dipole moment of the molecule. (c) The 
measured dipole moment of BrCl is 0.57 D. If you assume the 
bond length in BrCl is the sum of the atomic radii, what are 
the partial charges on the atoms in BrCl using the experi-
mental dipole moment?
 8.88 A major challenge in implementing the “hydrogen econ-
omy” is finding a safe, lightweight, and compact way of stor-
ing hydrogen for use as a fuel. The hydrides of light metals 
are attractive for hydrogen storage because they can store a 
high weight percentage of h
