s—do not contain a double bond and are more likely to be a solid at room
temperature.
Unsaturated fatty acids—have one or more double bonds and are more likely to be fluid at
room temperature.
ii. Phospholipids—consist of one glycerol molecule with two fatty acid molecules attached as well as
a polar component; they can self-assemble into a classic bilayer arrangement that is the basis of all
biological membranes.
iii. Wax and steroids—(including cholesterol) lipids with more complex structures that have a number
of functions. The following is the structure of the precursor lipid cholesterol:
3. Proteins—polymers made up of different combinations of 20 commonly occurring amino acid
monomers.
i.
Proteins have a wide variety of functions, including structural components of cells and tissues,
transport proteins in the cell’s membranes, and as catalysts called enzymes.
ii. Amino acids share the same basic structure:
Connected by a linear sequence through the formation of peptide bonds by d
