e. This is not so for an electron because its mass is 
so small, as we see in Sample Exercise 6.5.
A few years after de Broglie published his theory, the wave properties of the 
electron were demonstrated experimentally. When X rays pass through a crystal, 
an interference pattern results that is characteristic of the wave-like properties of 
electromagnetic radiation, a phenomenon called X-ray diffraction. As electrons pass 
through a crystal, they are similarly diffracted. Thus, a stream of moving electrons 
exhibits the same kinds of wave behavior as X rays and all other types of electromag-
netic radiation.
The technique of electron diffraction has been highly developed. In the elec-
tron microscope, for instance, the wave characteristics of electrons are used to obtain 
images at the atomic scale. This microscope is an important tool for studying surface 
phenomena at very high magnifications (Figure 6.14). Electron microscopes can mag-
nify objects by 3,000,000 times, far more th
