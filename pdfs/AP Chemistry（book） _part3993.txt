s greater for case (2) because the 
entire 100 J increases the internal energy of the system rather than a 
part of the energy doing work on the surroundings. 5.29 (a) A state 
function is a property that depends only on the physical state (pres-
sure, temperature, etc.) of the system, not on the route used to get to 
the current state. (b) Internal energy is a state function; heat is not 
a state function. (c) Volume is a state function. The volume of a sys-
tem depends only on conditions (pressure, temperature, amount of 
substance), not the route or method used to establish that volume. 
5.31 w = -51 J 5.33 (a) ∆H is usually easier to measure than ∆E 
because at constant pressure, ∆H = qp. The heat ﬂow associated with
