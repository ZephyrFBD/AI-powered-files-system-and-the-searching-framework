there is an obvious selective pressure on the cuckoos to have eggs that
resemble those of the parrotbills, so the eﬀects are predictable. (B) is
incorrect because there is selection on coloration: cuckoo eggs that
resemble parrotbill eggs are favored over those that do not. (C) is
incorrect because the taller bars indicate that contrasting eggs are
more likely to be rejected; contrast should actually decrease with
subsequent generations.

(A) The bone structures shown are examples of homologous
structures. The underlying pattern of bones suggests common
ancestry. (B) is incorrect because convergent evolution produces
structures that have a similar form but oȇen diﬀerent underlying
structures. It is unlikely that separate evolutionary paths would all lead
to bones, let alone the pattern of bones shown. Therefore, (C) is not
correct. (D) is incorrect because there is no way to determine which of
the species was the ancestral species from the figure shown. In
