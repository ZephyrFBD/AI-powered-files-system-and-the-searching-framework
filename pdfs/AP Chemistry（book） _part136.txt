ce before and after the change.) The evaporation of water 
is a physical change. When water evaporates, it changes from the liquid state to the 
gas state, but it is still composed of water molecules, as depicted in Figure 1.4. All 
changes of state (for example, from liquid to gas or from liquid to solid) are physi-
cal changes.
In a chemical change (also called a chemical reaction), a substance is trans-
formed into a chemically different substance. When hydrogen burns in air, for exam-
ple, it undergoes a chemical change because it combines with oxygen to form water 
(Figure 1.10).
Chemical changes can be dramatic. In the account given in Figure 1.11, Ira Remsen, 
author of a popular chemistry text published in 1901, describes his first experiences with 
chemical reactions.

While reading a textbook of chemistry, I came upon the statement “nitric acid acts upon copper,” and I determined
