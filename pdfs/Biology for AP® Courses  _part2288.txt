rticle that transfers random genomic segments from one species of
prokaryote to another
fusion of two prokaryotic genomes, presumably by endosymbiosis
division of family in the taxonomic classification system; the first part of the binomial scientific name
(also, lateral gene transfer) transfer of genes between unrelated species
division of domain in the taxonomic classification system
applying the simplest, most obvious way with the least number of steps
proposal that prokaryotes acquired a mitochondrion first, followed by nuclear
development
technique using molecular evidence to identify phylogenetic relationships
(also, clade) organisms that share a single ancestor
proposal that prokaryotes acquired a nucleus first, and then the mitochondrion
division of class in the taxonomic classification system
the simplest, most straightforward way of constructing phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships between
organisms
diagram used to reflect the evolutionary relationships among organisms
