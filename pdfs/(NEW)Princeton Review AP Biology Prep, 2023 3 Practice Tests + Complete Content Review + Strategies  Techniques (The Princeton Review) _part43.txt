Question 50–53 refer to the following passage.
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a common type of protein receptor containing seven
transmembrane segments and bearing intracellular and extracellular portions. The structure of a
typical GPCR and its associated partners is shown below. GPCRs are coupled to G-proteins
consisting of three subunits (α, β, and γ) that bind the nucleotides GTP or GDP on the
intracellular side of the GPCR. The presence or absence of a ligand on the extracellular side of the
GPCR determines whether GDP or GTP will bind to the intracellular G-protein. Extracellular
ligand binding initiates GDP being exchanged for GTP and the separation of the G-protein. One
subunit will travel to join with a secondary partner and will initiate a cascade of signaling effects
within the cell. In th
