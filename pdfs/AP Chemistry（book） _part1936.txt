f the groups bound to the carbons is rigid. In 
natural rubber, the chain extensions are on the same side of the double bond, as shown 
in Figure 12.42(a).
Natural rubber is not a useful polymer because it is too soft and too chemically reac-
tive. Goodyear accidentally discovered that adding sulfur and then heating the mixture 
make the rubber harder and reduce its susceptibility to oxidation and other chemical

chains. The cross-linking groups (red) 
constrain the relative motions of the 
polymer chains, making the material harder 
and less flexible than when the cross-links 
are not present.
Give It Some Thought
In copolymers made of ethylene and vinyl acetate monomers, melting point and 
degree of crystallinity decrease as the percentage of vinyl acetate increases.
