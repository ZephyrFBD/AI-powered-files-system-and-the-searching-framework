conduction electrons. When a positively charged object is brought
close to or touches a conductor, the free electrons in the conductor are attracted
by this positively charged object and move quickly toward it. If a negatively
charged object is brought close to the conductor, the free electrons in the con-
ductor move swiftly away from it. In a semiconductor, there are many fewer free
electrons, and in an insulator, almost none.
