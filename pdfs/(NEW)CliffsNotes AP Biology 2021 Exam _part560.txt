body fluids from the hemolymph that bathes the cells. The fluids, which
include both nitrogen wastes and materials to be retained (salts and water), are deposited into the midgut. As the
fluids pass through the hindgut of the insect (along with digested food), materials to be retained pass back in across
the walls of the digestive tract. Wastes continue in the tract and are excreted through the anus.
5. The mammalian kidney consists of about a million individual filtering tubes called nephrons. Two kidneys
produce waste fluid, or urine, which passes through ureters to the bladder for temporary storage. From the bladder,
the urine is excreted through the urethra ( ( 3).
Individual nephrons in the human kidney consist of a tube and closely associated blood vessels (Figure 13-3). The
nephron is strategically positioned in the kidney so that the tube winds from the outer portion of the kidney, the
cortex, down through the medulla, then back up into the cortex, and then back down through th
