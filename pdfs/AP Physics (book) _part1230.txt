se time when taken to high altitude? Why?
5. A tire swing hanging from a branch reaches nearly to the
ground (Fig. 11â€“49). How could you estimate the height 
of the branch using only a stopwatch?
6. For a simple harmonic oscillator, when (if ever) are the
displacement and velocity vectors in the same direction?
When are the displacement and acceleration vectors in the
same direction?
7. Two equal masses are attached to separate identical springs
next to one another. One mass is pulled so its spring stretches
40 cm and the other is pulled so its spring stretches only
20 cm. The masses are released simultaneously. Which mass
reaches the equilibrium point first?
8. What is the approximate period of your walking step?
9. What happens to the period of a playground swing if you
rise up from sitting to a standing position?
10. Why can you make water slosh back and forth in a pan
only if you shake the pan at a certain frequency?
11. Is the frequency of a simple periodic wave equal to the
