endergonic reactions can
take place in living cells. (B) is incorrect because reaction Y still needs
to reach its activation energy; some energy input would be required.
(C) is incorrect because enzymes can only lower activation energy;
they cannot change the free energy of products or reactants.

The cell and its surroundings form a closed system. The total entropy
of the system increases even as the entropy of the cell decreases.
Therefore, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because the release of water
molecules does not increase entropy. (C) is incorrect because entropy
actually decreases when complex molecules are synthesized. (D) is
incorrect because the laws of thermodynamics apply to all physical
systems, including organisms.

With few exceptions, all energy enters the biosphere as light from the
Sun through the process of photosynthesis. Aȇer the asteroid impact,
debris blocking the Sun prevented photosynthesis, taking ou
