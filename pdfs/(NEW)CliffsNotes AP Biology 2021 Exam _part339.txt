hromosome structure or in the makeup of the genome:
1. Deletions occur when segments of a chromosome are lost. Most chromosome deletions result in a significant loss
of important DNA and are fatal.
2. Duplications occur when segments of a chromosome are repeated. If the duplication occurs within a gene
segment, it is likely to cause a frameshift mutation with deleterious consequences. On the other hand, a duplicated
gene can have beneficial effects by providing additional gene products for processes that are in high demand. For
example, most species, including bacteria, have gene redundancy for the gene that codes for rRNA, a product in
high demand. Also, extra copies of a gene provide the opportunity for subsequent mutations to create novel gene
variations without interfering with the normal operation of the original gene. Some examples of this follow.
Globin genes. The great similarities among the various globin chains of hemoglobin suggest that they each evolved
from a common gene.
