 Inhibitor Y competes with substrates for binding in the active site and functions as a noncompetitive
inhibitor.
(D) Inhibitor Y binds allosterically and functions as a noncompetitive inhibitor.
3. A single-step chemical reaction is catalyzed by the addition of an enzyme. Which of the reaction coordinate
diagrams accurately shows the effect of the added enzyme (represented by the dashed line) to the reaction?
Questions 4â€“6 refer to the following diagram and paragraph.
Glycolysis (shown below) is a critical metabolic pathway that is utilized by nearly all forms of life. The process of
glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and converts 1 molecule of glucose into 2 molecules of pyruvic acid.
4. How many net ATP would be generated directly from glycolysis from the breakdown of 2 glucose molecules?
(A) 2
(B) 4
(C) 8
(D) 12
5. Glycolysis does not require oxygen to occur in cells. However, under anaerobic conditions, glycolysis
normally requires fermentation pathways to occur to con
