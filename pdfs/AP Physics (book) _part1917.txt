5. If it takes an amount of work W to move two 
point
charges from infinity to a distance d apart from each other,
then how much work should it take to move three 
point
charges from infinity to a distance d apart from each other?
(a) 2W.

6. A proton 
and an electron 
are in a
constant electric field created by oppositely charged plates.
You release the proton from near the positive plate and the
electron from near the negative plate. Which feels the larger
electric force?
(a) The proton.
(b) The electron.
(c) Neither—there is no force.
(d) The magnitude of the force is the same for both and in
the same direction.
(e) The magnitude of the force is the same for both but in
opposite directions.
