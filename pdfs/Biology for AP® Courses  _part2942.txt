Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the content described in this module is not within the scope of AP®. However, as we learn in the chapter on
biological macromolecules, in animals the organic molecules required for building cellular materials and tissues come
from food. During digestion, complex carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through
metabolic pathways, such as cellular respiration (see the chapter on cellular respiration). Excess sugars in the body are
stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles for later use. An
