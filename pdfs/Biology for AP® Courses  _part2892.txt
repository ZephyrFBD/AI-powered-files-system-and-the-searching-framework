39. The body sizes of organisms vary and tends to be
correlated with the region in which the organisms are
found. Why do organisms at different latitudes tend to
have different body sizes, and what is the relationship
between heat loss and body size in an organism?
a.
Temperature varies by latitude, and body size
affects heat retention and loss. Smaller
organisms lose heat at a slower rate than larger
organisms because they have a smaller surface
area for their mass.
b.
Temperature varies by latitude, and body size
affects heat retention and loss. Smaller
organisms lose heat at a faster rate than larger
organisms because they have a greater surface
area for their mass.
c.
Temperature varies by latitude, and body size
affects heat retention and loss. Larger organisms
lose heat at a faster rate than smaller organisms
because they have a greater surface area for their
mass.
d.
Temperature varies by latitude, and body size
affects heat retention and loss. Smaller
organisms lose
