SECTION 12–7
Doppler Effect
345
The Doppler effect also occurs when the source is at rest and the observer is
in motion. If the observer is traveling toward the source, the pitch heard is higher
than that of the emitted source frequency. If the observer is traveling away from
the source, the pitch heard is lower. Quantitatively the change in frequency is 
different than for the case of a moving source. With a fixed source and a moving
observer, the distance between wave crests, the wavelength 
is not changed.
But the velocity of the crests with respect to the observer is changed. If the
observ
