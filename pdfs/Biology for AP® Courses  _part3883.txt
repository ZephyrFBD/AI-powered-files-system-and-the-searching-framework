the descending loop of Henle, increased solute
secretion into the distal tubule, and decreased
water absorbtion in the collecting duct.
b.
Absorption of water from the filtrate would
decrease, indicated by decreased loss of water in
the ascending loop of Henle, increased solute
secretion into the distal tubule, and increased
water absorption in the collecting duct.

Absorption of water from the filtrate would
decrease, indicated by decreased loss of water in
the ascending loop of Henle, increased solute

Absorption of water from the filtrate would
decrease, indicated by decreased loss of water in
the descending loop of Henle, increased solute

The diagram models the countercurrent exchange
mechanism within the loop of Henle. The numbers within
the loop show the osmolarity of the filtrate, while the
