 One LED is red, 660 nm, and the other IR (900–940 nm). The 
LED beams pass through a finger (Fig. 29–36) or earlobe and are detected by a
photodiode. Oxygenated red blood cells absorb less red and more infrared light
than deoxygenated cells. A ratio of absorbed light (red IR) of 0.5 corresponds 
to nearly 100%
saturation; a ratio of 1.0 is about 85% and 2.0 corresponds to
about 50% (bad). The LED measures during complete pulses, including blood
surges, and the device can also count your heartbeat rate.
pn Diode Lasers
Diode lasers, using a pn-junction in forward bias like an LED, are the most
compact of lasers and are very common: they read CDs and DVDs and are used
as pointers and in laser printers. They emit photons like an LED but, like all lasers
(Section 28–11), need to have an inverted population of states for the lasing frequency.
This is achieved by applying a high forward-bias voltage. The large current brings
many electrons into the conduction band at the junction layer, and
