things grow, metabolize,
and reproduce. Viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells. They do not metabolize or
grow, but are assembled in their mature form.

The first organisms that originated about 3.5 billion years ago were prokaryotes that possessed the structures and metabolic
processes associated with cells (refer to the Cell Structure chapter). As discussed in the chapter on cell structure, prokaryotic
cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells and inhabit just about every square inch of our planet, from the most
inhospitable environments to the surface of the skin. Viruses are much small
