by the force of static friction.

Work Done by Torque
The work done on an object rotating about a fixed axis, such as the pulleys in
Figs. 8–21 and 8–22, can be written using angular quantities. As shown in
Fig. 8–26, a force F exerting a torque 
on a wheel does work 
in rotating the wheel a small distance 
at the point of application of 
The
wheel has rotated through a small angle
(Eq. 8–1). Hence
Because 
then
(8;17)
is the work done by the torque 
when rotating the wheel through an angle 
Finally, power P is the rate work is done:
which is analogous to the translational version,
(see Eq. 6–18).
