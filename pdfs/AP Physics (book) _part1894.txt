have been exaggerated for clarity.
FIGURE 17–30 Electron beam sweeps
across a CRT television screen in a
succession of horizontal lines. Each
horizontal sweep is made by varying
the voltage on the horizontal deflection
plates (Fig. 17–29). Then the electron
beam is moved down a short distance
by a change in voltage on the vertical
deflection plates, and the process
(referred to as a raster) is repeated.

TV and computer monitors
In TV and computer monitors, the CRT electron beam sweeps over the screen
in the manner shown in Fig. 17–30 by carefully synchronized voltages applied to
the deflection plates (more commonly by magnetic deflection coils—Chapter 20).
During each horizontal sweep of the electron beam, the grid (Fig.17–29) receives a
signal voltage that limits the flow of electrons at each instant during the sweep;
the more negative the grid voltage is,
