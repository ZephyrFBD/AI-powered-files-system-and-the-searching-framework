*Tasting chemical solutions is not a good practice. However, we have all had acids such as ascor-
bic acid (vitamin C), acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and citric acid (in citrus fruits) in our mouths, 
and we are familiar with their characteristic sour taste. Soaps, which are basic, have the charac-
teristic bitter taste of bases.

▲ Figure 4.9 Neutralization reaction between Mg(0H)2(s) and hydrochloric acid. Milk of  
magnesia is a suspension of water-insoluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2(s), in water. When  
sufficient hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), is added, a reaction ensues that leads to an aqueous
