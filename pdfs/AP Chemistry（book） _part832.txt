as shown in the accompanying illustration. Suppose they 
are separated to a larger distance r2, by moving them apart. 
 
(a) What change, if any, has occurred in the potential energy 
of the system? (b) What effect, if any, does this process have 
on the value of âˆ†E? (c) What can you say about q and w for 
this process?

 5.21 (a) Which of the following cannot leave or enter a closed sys-
tem: heat, work, or matter? (b) Which cannot leave or enter 
an isolated system? (c) What do we call the part of the uni-
verse that is not part of the system?
 5.22 In a thermodynamic study, a scientist focuses on the proper-
ties of a solution in an apparatus as illustrated. A solution is 
continuously flowing into the apparatus at the top and out at 
the bottom, such that the amount of solution in the appara-
tus is constant with time. (a) Is the solution in the apparatus
