ach color
segment in the key provides an alignment score range; the higher the alignment score, the greater the similarity
between the submitted sequence (from the fossil) and the sequence of another organism.
2. Query bar. The bar below the color key represents the DNA sequence submitted for the fossil.
 
3. Nucleotide Number. The numbers below the query bar enumerate the nucleotides in the submitted sequence.

4. Aligning Sequences. Each bar in the group shown here represents a sequence in another organism that matches
the submitted sequence. Match the color of the sequence to the color key to get an alignment score range for the
sequence. Bars are arranged so that the best matches are at the top. The span of each bar can be compared to the
submitted sequence in the query bar to determine the parts of the sequences that match and parts that are absent
(gaps).
