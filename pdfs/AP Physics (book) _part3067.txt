ionization energy. (a) Use the Bohr model to deter-
mine the ionization energy of the 
ion, which has a single electron. (b) Also
calculate the maximum wavelength a photon can have to cause ionization. The
helium atom is the second atom, after hydrogen, in the Periodic Table (next
Chapter); its nucleus contains 2 protons and normally has 2 electrons circulating
around it, so 
APPROACH We want to determine the minimum energy required to lift the
electron from its ground state and to barely reach the free state at 
The
ground state energy of 
is given by Eq. 27–15b with 
and 
SOLUTION (a) Since all the symbols in Eq. 27–15b are the same as for the
calculation for hydrogen, except that Z is 2 instead of 1, we see that 
will be
times the 
for hydrogen:
Thus, to ionize the 
ion should require 54.4 eV, and this value agrees with
experiment.
