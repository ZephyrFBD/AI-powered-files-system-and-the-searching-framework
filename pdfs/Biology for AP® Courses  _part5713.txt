ity are essentially the same.
Tegmark imagines the perceptions of characters in an advanced
computer game when the graphics are so good they don’t know they
are in a game. They think they can bump into real objects
(electromagnetic resistance in our reality), fall in love and feel
emotions like excitement. When they began to study the apparently
‘physical world’ of the video game they would realise that
everything was made of pixels (which have been found in our
energetic reality as must be the case when on one level our world is
digital). What computer game characters thought was physical
‘stuﬀ’, Tegmark said, could actually be broken down into numbers:
And we’re exactly in this situation in our world. We look around and it doesn’t seem that
mathematical at all, but everything we see is made out of elementary particles like quarks and
electrons. And what properties does an electron have? Does it have a smell or a colour or a
texture? No! ... We physicists have come up with geeky names
