at any particular temperature is the 
solubility of that solute at that temperature.
FACTORS AFFECTING SOLUBILITY (SECTION 13.3) The solubility 
of one substance in another depends on the tendency of systems to 
become more random, by becoming more dispersed in space, and 
on the relative intermolecular solute–solute and solvent–solvent 
energies compared with solute–solvent interactions. Polar and ionic 
solutes tend to dissolve in polar solvents, and nonpolar solutes tend 
to dissolve in nonpolar solvents (“like dissolves like”). Liquids that 
mix in all proportions are miscible; those that do not dissolve signifi-
cantly in one another are immiscible. Hydrogen-bonding interactions 
between solute and solvent often play an important role in deter-
mining solubility; for example, ethanol and water, whose molecules 
form hydrogen bonds with each other, are miscible. The solubilities 
of gases in a liquid are generally proportional to the pressure of the 
gas over the solution, as expre
