 as
exponential growth, logistic growth, K and r selection, and factors
that can alter these trends.
Population Increase to Carrying Capacity
The three lines in the previous graph show the increases in population
size with a constant rate of population growth (r = 0.10) for three
populations whose carrying capacities are not the same. Carrying
capacities are indicated on the graph. When the carrying capacity
increases for a population with a constant growth rate, the shape of the
growth curve hardly changes. It is the ultimate population size that is
really aﬀected.
Populations with Diﬀerent Carrying Capacities
AP EXPERT NOTE
Population Growth Factors
Factors that aﬀect population growth fall into two categories,
density-independent and density-dependent.
Diﬀerent biotic and abiotic factors in the environment have contributed
to adaptive strategies that allow organisms to maximize their
reproduction. Species that monopolize rapidly changing environments,
such as disturbed habitats, pro
