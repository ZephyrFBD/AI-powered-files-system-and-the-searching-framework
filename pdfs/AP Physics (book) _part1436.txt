rage translational kinetic energy of molecules in random motion in an
ideal gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
The higher the temperature, according to kinetic theory, the faster the molecules
are moving on average. This relation is one of the triumphs of kinetic theory.

TEMPERATURE RELATED TO
AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY
OF MOLECULES
Molecular kinetic energy. What is the average transla-
tional kinetic energy of molecules in an ideal gas at 37°C?
APPROACH We use the absolute temperature in Eq. 13–8.
SOLUTION We change 37°C to 310 K and insert into Eq. 13–8:
NOTE A mole of molecules would have a total translational kinetic energy equal
to
which equals the kinetic en
