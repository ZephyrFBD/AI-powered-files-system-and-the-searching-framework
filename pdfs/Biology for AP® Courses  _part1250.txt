Figure 11.8 In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. Fusion of the
gametes gives rise to a fertilized egg cell, or zygote. The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a
multicellular offspring. The germ cells are generated early in the development of the zygote.
Haploid-Dominant Life Cycle
Most fungi and algae employ a life-cycle type in which the “body” of the organism—the ecologically important part of the
life cycle—is haploid. The haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage are formed by mitosis.
During sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals, designated the (+) and (−) mating types, join to
form a diploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four
