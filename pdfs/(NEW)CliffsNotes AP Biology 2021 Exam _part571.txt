otrypsin.
Liver. The liver produces bile, which functions to emulsify fats. Emulsification is the breaking up of fat globules
into smaller fat droplets, increasing the surface area upon which fat-digesting enzymes (lipase, for example) can
operate. Since bile does not chemically change anything, it is not an enzyme. Bile is also alkaline, serving to help
neutralize the HCl in the chyme. The bile is stored adjacent to the liver in the gallbladder and flows through the bile
duct, where it merges with the pancreatic duct.
The remainder of the small intestine (nearly6m) absorbs the breakdown products of food. It is characterized by villi
and microvilli, finger-like projections of the intestinal wall that increase its total absorptive surface area. Amino
acids and sugars are absorbed into blood capillaries, while most of the fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed into the
lymphatic system.
6. Large intestine. The main function of the large intestine, or colon, is the reabsorption of water to
