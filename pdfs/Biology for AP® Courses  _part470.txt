rior of the cell where they maintain cell shape by resisting compressive forces.
Intermediate filaments are found throughout the cell and hold organelles in place.
Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, microfilaments are the narrowest. They function in cellular
movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin (Figure
4.23). For this reason, microfilaments are also known as actin filaments.
Figure 4.23 Microfilaments are made of two intertwined strands of actin.
Actin is powered by ATP to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein

called myosin. This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in eukaryotic cells and
cytoplasmic streaming, which is the circular movement of the cell cytoplasm in plant cells.
