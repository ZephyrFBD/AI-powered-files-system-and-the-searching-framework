eart is three chambered, but the ventricles are
partially separated so some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurs except in crocodilians and birds.
(d) Mammals and birds have the most efficient heart with four chambers that completely separate the oxygenated and
deoxygenated blood; it pumps only oxygenated blood through the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs.
As illustrated in Figure 31.4a Fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two-chambered heart that has only a single
atrium and a single ventricle. The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to
the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re-oxygenated; this is called gill circulation. The blood then continues
through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium; this is called systemic circulation. This unidirectional flow
of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fishâ€™s systemic circuit. The result is a l
