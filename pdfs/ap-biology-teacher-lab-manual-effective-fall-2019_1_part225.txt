derstand how microscopes opened up an entire new world of biological 
understanding. For some, it is not as easy to see the value of mathematics to the study 
of biology, but, like the microscope, math and computers provide tools to explore 
the complexity of biology and biological systems â€” providing deeper insights and 
understanding of what makes living systems work. 
To explore how allele frequencies change in populations of organisms, you will first 
build a computer spreadsheet that models the changes in a hypothetical gene pool from 
one generation to the next. You need a basic familiarity with spreadsheet operations 
to complete this lab successfully. You may have taken a course that introduced you to 
spreadsheets before. If so, that will be helpful, and you may want to try to design and 
build your model on your own after establishing some guidelines and assumptions. 
Otherwise, you may need more specific guidance from your teacher. You can use almost 
any spreadsheet program
