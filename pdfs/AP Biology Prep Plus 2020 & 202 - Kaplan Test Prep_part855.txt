e hypothesis stated in the
question, which is that the lynx population levels fall due to a lack of
food. (D) would not test the eﬀect of a lack of food on the lynx
population.
9. B
Learning Objective: 19.2
(B) If the drop in the snowshoe hare population was due to toxins in
the snowshoe hares’ food, providing an alternative food source should
prevent the crash. Removing the lynx from the environment would not
test the eﬀects of these toxins, so (A) is incorrect. Sampling the plants
for toxins aȇer the snowshoe hare population crashes would give no
information about why the population crashed, so (C) is incorrect. (D)
is incorrect because simply removing the hares from this environment
would give no information about the toxicity of the plants or the eﬀect
of plant toxicity on the snowshoe hare population levels.
10. C
Learning Objective: 19.5
(C) Lots of green sea turtles die young, but the adults live a long time.
Therefore, the curve should plummet initially and then level oﬀ with
