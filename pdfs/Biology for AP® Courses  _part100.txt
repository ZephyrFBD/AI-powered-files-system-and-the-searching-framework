Homeostasis

temperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin.

In order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate
concentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms
are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through
homeostasis (literally, “steady state”). For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process
known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.13), have body structures
that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body hea
