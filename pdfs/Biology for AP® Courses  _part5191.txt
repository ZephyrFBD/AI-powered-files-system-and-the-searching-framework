puter-generation constitutes scientiﬁc
fraud and he makes this superb analogy:
Here is an equivalency: A group of researchers claim to have found a unicorn because they
found a piece of a hoof, a hair from a tail, and a snippet of a horn. They then add that
information into a computer and program it to re-create the unicorn, and they then claim this
computer re-creation is the real unicorn. Of course, they had never actually seen a unicorn so
could not possibly have examined its genetic makeup to compare their samples with the
actual unicorn’s hair, hooves and horn.
The researchers claim they decided which is the real genome of SARS-CoV-2 by ‘consensus’,
sort of like a vote. Again, different computer programs will come up with different versions of
the imaginary ‘unicorn’, so they come together as a group and decide which is the real
imaginary unicorn.
This is how the ‘virus’ that has transformed the world was brought
into fraudulent ‘existence’. Extraordinary, yes, but as the Nazis sa
