over the cell cycle and other cell growth processes.
Cells normally undergo cell division during activities such as development, growth,
maintenance, and repair of an organism’s body.
Some cells divide repeatedly to produce masses of cells called tumors.
Tumors become dangerous if they interfere with normal body functions, and if they spread
—metastasize—to multiple locations within the body, causing cancer.
ii. Mutations that cause tumors can occur in germ cells or somatic cells.
A mutation in a germ cell can be inherited, and people with inherited mutations are more
susceptible to developing some types of cancer.
Mutations in somatic cells add to the effects of inherited mutations, making the development
of cancer more likely.
iii. There are several types of genes that, when mutated, can result in cancer.
Genes that normally regulate the cell cycle or a cell’s response to growth hormones—called
proto-oncogenes in this context—mutate to form oncogenes.
Other normal genes, called
