ants, they metabolize the sugars, thereby incorporating 14C in 
their bodies. Figure 21.8 Gamma rays. Both X rays and gamma 
rays consist of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, whereas alpha 
and beta rays are streams of particles. Figure 21.9 Ionization 
energy. Detection depends on the ability of the radiation to cause 
ionization of the gas atoms. Figure 21.14 The mass numbers are 
equal on both sides. Remember that this does not mean that mass is 
conservedâ€”mass is lost during the reaction, which appears as energy 
released. Figure 21.15 16. Each of the eight neutrons would split 
another uranium-235 nucleus, releasing two more neutrons.  
Figure 21.16 Critical without being supercritical so that the release 
of energy is controlled. Figure 21.23 Alpha rays are less danger-
ous when outside the body because they cannot penetrate the skin. 
However, once inside the body they can do great harm to any cells 
that are nearby.
