rs normally have large extracellular
and intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand.
When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme.
Activation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response. One example of this
type of enzyme-linked receptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor (Figure 9.8). A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate
groups from ATP to another protein. The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules (tyrosine
residues). First, signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors. The two
neighboring receptors then bond together, or dimerize. Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular
domain of the receptors (phosphorylation). The phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to t
