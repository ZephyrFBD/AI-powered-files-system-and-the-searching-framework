FIGURE 31â€“10 J. Robert
Oppenheimer, on the left, with
General Leslie Groves, who was the
administrative head of Los Alamos
during World War II. The
photograph was taken at the Trinity
site in the New Mexico desert, where
the first atomic bomb was exploded.
To build a bomb that was subcritical during transport but that could be made
supercritical (to produce a chain reaction) at just the right moment, two pieces of
uranium were used, each less than the critical mass but together greater than the
critical mass. The two masses, kept separate until the moment of detonation,
were then forced together quickly by a kind of gun, and a chain reaction of
explosive proportions occurred. An alternate bomb detonated conventional
explosives (TNT) surrounding a plutonium sphere to compress it by implosion to
double its density, making it more than critical and causing a nuclear explosion.
The first fission bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. It was
