eld. Let us consider the case of a uniform electric field, such as
that between the parallel plates of Fig. 17–1 whose difference of potential is 
The work done by the electric field to move a positive charge q from point a to
point b is equal to the negative of the change in potential energy (Eq. 17–2b), so
We can also write the work done as the force times distance, where the force on q is
so
where d is the distance (parallel to the field lines) between points a and b. We
now set these two expressions for W equal and find
or
[uniform ] (17;4a)
If we solve for E, we find
[uniform ] (17;4b)
From Eq. 17–4b we see that the units for electric field can be written as volts 
per meter 
, as well as newtons per coulomb (
, from
). These
are equivalent because
The minus
sign in Eq. 17–4b tells us that 
points in the direction of decreasing potential V.
