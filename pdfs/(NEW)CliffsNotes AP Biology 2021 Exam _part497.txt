Structural defenses. Leaves are edible parts of plants and, as a
result, bear sharp edges (thorns, spines) or irritating trichomes
(hairs) to discourage herbivory. Some trichomes are modified as
glands, releasing sticky or noxious chemicals when touched.
Other defenses include physical barriers, such as the bark of
trunks and roots or impenetrable seed coats of seeds.
Chemical defenses. Plants possess an arsenal of toxic secondary metabolites to discourage browsing. For example,
the nicotine in tobacco, the capsicum in hot peppers, and the mustard oils in broccoli are toxic to many insects
(although, for peppers and broccoli, these foods are safe for humans). Many of the secondary metabolites are only
toxic after they have been digested in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, allowing toxic products to be released.
Some plants recruit animals or other plants to help protect them from herbivory:
 
Parasitoid wasps are recruited by some plants to attack browsing insects. In response
