 offer 
 
 that up and I’ll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan 
 
 is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names 
 
 he’ll smile and tell you he’ll pray for you and he’ll offer it up for his soul 
 
 and yours.The boys in Leamy’s don’t want Fintan praying for them and 
 
 they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying 
 
 for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which 
 
 is ridiculous because you can’t be a saint till you’re dead. He says our 
 
  
  
 grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My 
 
 grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister 
 
 ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows 
 
 he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every 
 
 Saturday night so that he’ll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he 
 
 meets you going to Mass he’ll say, Isn’t my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He 
 
 loves that
