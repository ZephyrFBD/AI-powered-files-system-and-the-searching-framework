n the experiment.
(c) The student makes the following null hypothesis for this experiment: “There is no statistically significant
difference between the number of cells in mitosis and in interphase between the onions grown in distilled
water and the onions grown in 0.002 M caffeine.” Use the data and the chi-square test to evaluate the
student’s hypothesis.
(d) The start of mitosis is triggered in cells by mitosis-promoting factor (MPF). MPF forms when cyclin
protein binds to a cyclin-dependent kinase. Explain how a drug that irreversibly binds to the active site of
cyclin-dependent kinase would affect the cell cycle.
