Figure 35.24 Estuaries are formed when marine water and fresh water meet. As a result, the water in estuaries
vary widely in salinity. Organisms living in estuaries, such as the mangroves pictured here, must be able to tolerate
a wide variation of salinity. (credit: Moni3, Wikimedia Commons)
The spring and fall turnovers are important processes in freshwater lakes that act to move nutrients and water from the
bottom to the top. Explain how this is different in temperate regions as compared to the tropics.
a.
Spring turnover occurs in tropical lakes, but not in temperate lakes. Stratification occurs in temperate lakes.
b.
Temperate lakes do not freeze so they do not undergo spring turnover or stratification.
c.
Stratification and spring turnover occur in tropical lakes. Temperate lakes do not freeze so they do not
undergo spring turnover.
d.
Stratification and spring turnover occur in temperate lakes. Tropical lakes do not freeze so they do not
undergo spring turnover.
