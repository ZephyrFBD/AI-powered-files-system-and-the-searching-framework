These data were collected on the population size of a
species of plant growing in a region during the years after
a flood destroyed the area. Explain what the data indicate
about this population.
a.
The plant population grew exponentially
throughout the years as the numbers of
individuals increased at an exponential rate. The
population eventually became stable after
reaching a maximum number of 120 individuals,
which could be the carrying capacity of the
environment.
b.
The population grew exponentially in the first
few years and later became logistic as the rate
slowed down. T
