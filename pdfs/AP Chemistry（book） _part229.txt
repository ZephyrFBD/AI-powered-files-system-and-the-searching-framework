the mass of 0.1500 L of benzene at this temperature.
 1.37  (a) To identify a liquid substance, a student determined its 
density. Using a graduated cylinder, she measured out a 45-mL 
sample of the substance. She then measured the mass of the 
sample, finding that it weighed 38.5 g. She knew that the sub-
stance had to be either isopropyl alcohol 1density 0.785 g>mL2 
or toluene 1density 0.866 g>mL2. What are the calculated den-
sity and the probable identity of the substance? (b) An experi-
ment requires 45.0 g of ethylene glycol, a liquid whose density 
is 1.114 g>mL. Rather than weigh the sample on a balance, a 
chemist chooses to dispense the liquid using a graduated cylin-
der. What volume of the liquid should he use? (c) Is a graduated 
cylinder such as that shown in Figure 1.21 likely to afford the 
accuracy of measurement needed? (d) A cubic piece of metal 
measures 5.00 cm on each edge. If the metal is nickel, whose 
density is 8.90 g>cm3, what is the mass of the cube?
