. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize data. In particular, you may need to calculate averages (mean,
median, and mode) or measures of variation (range, standard error, and standard deviation). Definitions and
formulas for these statistics are provided on the equations and formulas pages.
2. The chi-square (χ2) test for goodness-of-fit is used to compare
observed results with expected results. The statistic tells you whether the two are significantly different. In
particular, the statistic determines whether the difference is due to chance (at an accepted probability) or whether
some other factor is responsible. To understand this statistic,
consider the following two values of χ2:
 χ2 = 0. In this case, the observed results and the expected results
 
are exactly the same.
 χ2 = 100. In most cases, this value of χ2 is a relatively large value
and will indicate that the difference between the observed and expected results did not occur by chance and that they
should be considere
