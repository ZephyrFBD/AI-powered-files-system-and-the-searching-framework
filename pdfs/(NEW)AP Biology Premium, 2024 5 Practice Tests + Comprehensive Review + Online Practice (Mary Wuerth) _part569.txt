11. (a) The rate of population growth is 
 geese per year.
(b) This population of geese is increasing because the birth rate is greater than the death rate.
(c) It is expected that the geese population will exceed the carrying capacity of the lake within the 10-year
period.
(d) The growth rate of the geese population is 0.10, or 10%. If that growth rate continues over the next 10 years,
the population of geese will exceed the lakeâ€™s carrying capacity before the end of the 10-year period.
12. (a) The Arctic fox is a secondary consumer. The puffin is a primary consumer. The Arctic grass is a producer.
(b) On average, only about 10% of the energy is available to the next trophic level. So the number of puffins
must exceed the number of Arctic foxes or else the Arctic foxes would not be able to meet their energy
needs.
(c) The elimination of all Arctic foxes would increase the number
