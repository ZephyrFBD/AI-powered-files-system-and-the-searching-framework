never
gets hot). Why will it heat a metal pan, usually iron, but not a glass container?
RESPONSE The ac current sets up a changing magnetic field that passes through
the pan bottom. This changing magnetic field induces a current in the pan, and
since the pan offers resistance, electric energy is transformed to thermal energy which
heats the pan and its contents. If the pan is iron, magnetic hysteresis due to the
changing current produces additional heating. A glass container offers such high
resistance that little current is induced and little energy is transferred AP = V2RB.
