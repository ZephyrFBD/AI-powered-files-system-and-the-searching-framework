ayed heavily with the
pesticide DDT in the 1950s, which entered the food chain and accumulated
in the bald eagle at the top of the food chain. Because DDT interferes with
the deposition of calcium in eggshells, the thin-shelled eggs were broken
easily and few eaglets hatched. DDT is now outlawed, and the bald eagle
was saved from extinction by human intervention.
Decomposers
Decomposers—bacteria and fungi—are usually not depicted in any
diagram of a food chain. However, without decomposers to recycle
nutrients back to the soil to nourish plants, there would be no food chain
and no life.
ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION
Most communities are dynamic, not stable. The size of a population
increases and decreases around the carrying capacity. Migration of a new
species into a habitat can alter the entire food chain. Major disturbances,
whether natural or human-made, like volcanic eruptions, strip mining,
clear-cutting a forest, and forest fires, can suddenly and drastically destroy
a community or an e
