ge on the opposite side, as shown in Fig. 17–19c.
Some of the electric field lines, then, do not pass through the dielectric but
instead end on charges induced on the surface as shown in Fig. 17–19c. Hence 
the electric field within the dielectric is less than in air. That is, the electric field 
in the space between the capacitor plates, assumed filled by the dielectric, has
been reduced by some factor K. The voltage across the capacitor is reduced 
by the same factor K because
(Eq.17–4) and hence, by Eq.17–7,
the capacitance C must increase by that same factor K to keep Q constant.
17–9 Storage of Electric Energy
A charged capacitor stores electric energy by 
The
energy stored in a capacitor will be equal to the work done to charge it. The net
effect of charging a capacitor is to remove charge from one plate and add it to the
other plate. This is what a battery does when it is connected to a capacitor.
A capacitor does not become charged instantly. It takes some time, often very litt
