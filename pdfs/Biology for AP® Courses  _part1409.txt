, cC)/64 =

B. Using the probability method, calculate the likelihood
of these phenotypes from each trihybrid cross:
•
recessive in all traits from the cross AaBbCc ×
aabbcc
•
recessive in the gene with alleles C and c and
dominant in the other two traits from the cross
AaBbCc × AaBbCc
•
dominant in the gene with alleles A and a and
recessive in the other two traits from the cross
AaBbcc × AaBbCc
C. The probability method is an easy way to calculate the
likelihood of each particular phenotype, but it doesn’t
simultaneously display the probability of all possible
phenotypes. The forked line representation described in
the text allows the entire phenotypic distribution to be
displayed. Using the forked line method, calculate the
probabilities in a cross between AABBCc and Aabbcc
parents:
•
all traits are recessive: aabbcc
•
traits are dominant at each loci, A?B?C?
•
traits are dominant at two genes and recessive at the
third
•
traits are dominant at one gene and recessive at the
ot
