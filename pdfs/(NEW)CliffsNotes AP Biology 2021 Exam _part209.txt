rged molecule. As a result, it is unable to cross the
plasma membrane. Therefore, it must bind to a membrane receptor protein, never actually entering the cell.
2. B. Steroids are nonpolar molecules able to traverse the plasma membrane unaided. After crossing the membrane,
cortisol binds to an intracellular receptor protein. Note that signaling molecules do not themselves bind to DNA or
mRNA, but rather activate receptor proteins that initiate the appropriate chemical responses.
3. D. Second messengers are small nonprotein molecules. Transcription factors are proteins.
4. A. Gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants provide a passageway between adjacent cells for
signaling molecules to pass. Synaptic signaling occurs across synapses, the small gaps between nerve cells.
Paracrine signaling occurs among nearby cells, and endocrine signaling occurs for cells separated by relatively large
distances.
5. C. A receptor protein becomes activated when it undergoes a threedimensional
