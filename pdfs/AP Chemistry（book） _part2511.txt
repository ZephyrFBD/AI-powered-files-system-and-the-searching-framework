The aqueous solution of HCl is known as hydrochloric acid. Concentrated hydrochloric 
acid is about 37% HCl by mass and is 12 M in HCl.
Sodium hydroxide is an Arrhenius base. Because NaOH is an ionic compound, it dis-
sociates into Na+ and OH - ions when it dissolves in water, thereby increasing the con-
centration of OH - ions in the solution.

Give It Some Thought
Which two ions are central to the Arrhenius definitions of acids and bases?

16.2 ∣ Brønsted–Lowry Acids and Bases
The Arrhenius concept of acids and bases, while useful, is rather limited. For one thing, 
it is restricted to aqueous solutions. In 1923 the Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted 
 
(1879–1947) and
