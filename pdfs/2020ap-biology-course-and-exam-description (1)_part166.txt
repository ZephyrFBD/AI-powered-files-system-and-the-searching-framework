The ability to describe, analyze, and create 
models and representations to explain and/
or illustrate biological processes and make 
predictions about them is an important 
skill for students to master. The primary 
learning goal in this unit is to create or use 
a representation/model to communicate 
biological phenomena, use the model to 
solve a problem, and refine the model or 
representation to analyze situations or 
solve problems.
Throughout the course, students should 
have had multiple opportunities that involve 
making a claim, supporting it with evidence, 
and providing reasoning to support the 
claim. In this unit and throughout the course, 
students should become proficient in 
argumentation by predicting the causes or 
effects of a change in, or disruption to, one or 
more components in a biological system.
