e eukaryotic protozoan parasite P. falciparum is the causative agent of malaria. P. falciparum cells contain 
an organelle called the apicoplast (see Figure 1). Apicoplasts synthesize precursors of biomolecules that are 
required for growth and reproduction of the parasite. 
(a) Based on Figure 1, describe TWO pieces of evidence a researcher could use to support the claim that 
apicoplasts evolved from free-living, prokaryotic organisms. 
(b) Doxycycline is a drug used to treat malaria and some bacterial infections. Doxycycline binds to the 
prokaryotic 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibits its function. Explain how doxycycline can be an effective 
treatment for a P. falciparum infection in humans.
