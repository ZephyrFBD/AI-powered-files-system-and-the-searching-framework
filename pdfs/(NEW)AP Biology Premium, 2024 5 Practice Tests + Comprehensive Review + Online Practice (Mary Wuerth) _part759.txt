is, and 
of the cells are in interphase.
(b) The onions grown in distilled water are the control group, the independent variable is the presence or
absence of 2 millimolars of caffeine in the growth medium, and the dependent variable is the number of
cells in mitosis and interphase in each group.
(c) Using the formula for chi-square:
There are four possible outcomes in the experiment, so the number of degrees of freedom is 4 â€“ 1 = 3.
Using a p-value of 0.05 and the chi-square table, the critical value is 7.81. Since the calculated chi-square
value (0.4010) is less than the critical value in the chi-square table, the null hypothesis is supported (or we
can say we fail to reject the null hypothesis).
(d) A drug that binds irreversibly to the active site of the cyclin-dependent kinase would prevent the binding of
cyclin to the cyclin-dependent kinase and therefore prevent the formation of mitosis-promoting factor. The
cell cycle would be arrested at the end of interphase and would not ent
