s with this
codon. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids brought to the
ribosome by the first two tRNAs, forming the beginning of the polypeptide chain. Once the peptide bond is
formed between the amino acids, the first tRNA releases its amino acid (which is now linked to the second
amino acid), and the first tRNA is released from the ribosome. (See Figure 16.5.) This translocation of the
ribosome and the addition of new amino acids to the polypeptide chain is called elongation and is repeated
one codon at a time until a stop codon is reached.

3. Termination: Stop codons (also known as “nonsense” codons) do not code for any amino acid. As shown in
Figure 16.6, when the ribosome reaches a stop codon, proteins called release factors bind to the ribosome.
These release factors cause the ribosome to disassemble and release the polypeptide chain. This ends
translation and is called termination.
