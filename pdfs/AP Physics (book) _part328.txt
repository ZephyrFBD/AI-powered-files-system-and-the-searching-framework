or the wind blows the
leaves of a tree, a force is being exerted. We often call these contact forces because
the force is exerted when one object comes in contact with another object. On
the other hand, we say that an object falls because of the force of gravity (which is
not a contact force).
If an object is at rest, to start it moving requires force—that is, a force is
needed to accelerate an object from zero velocity to a nonzero velocity. For an
object already moving, if you want to change its velocity—either in direction or in
magnitude—a force is required. In other words, to accelerate an object, a force 
is always required. In Section 4–4 we discuss the precise relation between accel-
eration and net force, which is Newton’s second law.
One way to measure the magnitude (or strength) of a force is to use a spring
scale (Fig. 4–2). Normally, such a spring scale is used to find the weight of an
object; by weight we mean the force of gravity acting on the object (Section 4–6).
