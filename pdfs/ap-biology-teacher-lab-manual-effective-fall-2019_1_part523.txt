 ask their own questions about 
transformation and explore answers. You may assign the background material and prelab 
questions for homework; as a think, pair/group, share activity, in which pairs or small 
groups of students brainstorm ideas and then share them with other groups; or as a 
whole-class discussion. 
Before beginning this investigation, students should have a solid understanding of 
the structure and function of DNA. You might want to take them through the discovery 
of transformation in 1928 by Frederick Griffith. Griffith was studying the bacterium 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia, the leading cause of death in the 
Western Hemisphere at the time of his research. Ask students to investigate Griffith’s 
experiments and their significance in identifying the “transforming principle,” later 
identified as DNA. Students can present their findings in the form of a poster or diagram 
with annotation.
