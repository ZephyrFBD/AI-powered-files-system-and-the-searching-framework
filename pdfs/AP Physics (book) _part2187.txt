due to a circular loop of wire.
FIGURE 20–8 (a) Deflection of compass needles near a current-carrying wire, showing the presence and 
direction of the magnetic field. (b) Iron filings also align along the direction of the magnetic field lines near a 
straight current-carrying wire. (c) Diagram of the magnetic field lines around an electric current in a straight wire.
(d) Right-hand rule for remembering the direction of the magnetic field: when the thumb points in the direction of 
the conventional current, the fingers wrapped around the wire point in the direction of the magnetic field.
