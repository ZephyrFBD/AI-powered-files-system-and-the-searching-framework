Interpretation of this Exercise
Lambda phage DNA was incubated with restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI separately. The
migration distance of the DNA bands produced by HindIII were measured in centimeters and were
plotted against bare paper size using semi-log paper. This was accomplished with DNA gel
electrophoresis.
Drawing the line of best fits allows for interpolation of the same DNA cut with EcoRI. Based on the
line of best fit, the base pairs of the lambda DNA can be found and compared to the known value.
