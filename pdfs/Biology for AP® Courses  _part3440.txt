now that during pregnancy
progesterone levels remain elevated and that cells in both
the pituitary gland and GnRH expressing neurons (GEN)
have progesterone nuclear receptors (PGR) that act as
transcription factors to either i) inhibit production of
GnRH possibly by blocking transcription of GNRH1, the
gene coding for GnRH, or ii) inhibit production of LH by
blocking transcription in the GnRH neurons of the gene,
LH1, coding for LH.
C. Construct two alternative explanations of the role of
progesterone as a birth control drug. Your explanation can
be in the form of descriptions or in terms of diagrams
involving the key molecular components PG, PGR, LH,
LH1, GEN, GnRH, and GnRH1.
An endocrine disruptor is a molecule with a structure that
mimics a hormone and can interfere with regulation. The
chemical bis-phenol A (BPA) has been used for many
years in the production of plastics and is now widespread.
BPA mimics estrogen. BPA is present in most humans at
the concentration of 5 micrograms
