while the atomic mass 
is the sum of the mass of the nucleus and the electrons. So the atomic 
mass of iron-56 is 26 * me larger than the nuclear mass. page 922 
No. Stable nuclei having mass numbers around 100 are the most 
stable nuclei. They could not form a still more stable nucleus with an 
accompanying release of energy. page 931 The absorbed dose is 
equal to 0.10 J * 11 rad>1 * 10-2 J2 = 10 rads. The effective dosage 
is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by the relative biologi-
cal effectiveness (RBE) factor, which is 10 for alpha radiation. Thus, 
the effective dosage is 100 rems.

page 945 No. There is a triple bond in N2. P does form triple bonds, as 
it would have to in order to form P2. page 947 H-, hydride. page

is 0. page 954 0 for Cl2; -1 for Cl-; +1 for ClO- page 955 They 
should both be strong, since the central halogen is in the +5 oxida-
tion state for both of them. We need to
