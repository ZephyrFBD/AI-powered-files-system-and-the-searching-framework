lysis
shows that emus and ostriches share more genetic
homology with flying birds which live in the same region
than with each other. What is the best explanation for these
findings?
a.
This is an example of an early shared ancestor.
b.
This is an example of convergent evolution.
c.
This is an example of random DNA homology.
d.
This is an example of divergent evolution.
40. A scientist decides to investigate the evolutionary
connection between closely related bacteria. Which gene
would be a good choice to use for establishing relatedness,
a very well conserved gene or a poorly conserved
sequence? Explain your reasoning.
a.
A very well conserved gene would be a good
choice, because well conserved genes undergo
sufficient changes during relatively short times,
which allows for the study of recent
evolutionary events. Well-conserved genes do
not undergo changes during short durations.
b.
A poorly conserved gene would be a good
choice, because poorly conserved genes show
sequence similarit
