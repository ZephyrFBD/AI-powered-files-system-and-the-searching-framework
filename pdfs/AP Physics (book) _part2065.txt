OLUTION The equivalent resistance,
of the 
and 
resistors in
parallel is
This is 
so we take the reciprocal to find RP.

It is a common mistake to forget to take this reciprocal. The units of reciprocal
ohms,
are a reminder. Thus
This 
is the equivalent resistance of the two parallel resistors, and is in series
with the 
resistor (see equivalent circuit, Fig. 19–7b). To find the total equiva-
lent resistance 
we add the 
and 
resistances, since they are in series:
The total current flowing from the battery is then
NOTE This I is also the current flowing through the 
resistor, but not through
the 
and 
resistors (both currents are less—see the next Example).
