s the
translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system.
All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the
thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to
processing that particular sense.
27.2 Somatosensation
Somatosensation includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well as from the limbs and
joints. Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well, and a variety of
receptor types, embedded in the skin and mucous membranes, play a role.
There are several types of specialized sensory receptors. Rapidly adapting free nerve endings detect nociception, hot and
cold, and light touch. Slowly adapting, encapsulated Merkel’s disks are found in fingertips and lips, and respond to light
touch. Meissner’s corpuscles, found in glabrous skin, are rapidly adaptin
