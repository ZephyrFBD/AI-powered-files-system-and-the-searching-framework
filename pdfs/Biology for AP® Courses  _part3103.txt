between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. The
PNS can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions without conscious control,
and the sensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs
to the CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles. The autonomic nervous system can be further divided into
the parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways. “Rest and digest” responses are activated by the parasympathetic division,
whereas “fight or flight” responses are activated by the sympathetic division. In other words, these two systems often have
opposing effects on target organs; for example, activation of the parasympathetic system slows heart rate, whereas activation
of the sympathetic system increases heart rate. (If, as you’re reading this information, a Tyrannosaurus rex barged into the
room, which division would be activated?) The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up
