object and it would be neutral again.
Charge separation can also be done in nonconductors. If you bring a positively
charged object close to a neutral nonconductor as shown in Fig. 16–9, almost no
electrons can move about freely within the nonconductor. But they can move
slightly within their own atoms and molecules. Each oval in Fig. 16–9 represents a
molecule (not to scale); the negatively charged electrons, attracted to the external
positive charge, tend to move in its direction within their molecules. Because the
negative charges in the nonconductor are nearer to the external positive charge,
the nonconductor as a whole is attracted to the external positive charge (see the
Chapter-Opening Photo, page 443).
An electroscope is a device that can be used for detecting charge. As shown in
Fig. 16–10, inside a case are two movable metal leaves, often made of gold foil,
connected to a metal knob on the outside. (Sometimes only one leaf is movable.)
