les in sync, machines called synchrocyclotrons reduce the frequency in
time to correspond to the increase of 
(in Eq. 32–2) as a packet of charged
particles increases in speed more slowly at larger orbits.
Synchrotron
Another way to accelerate relativistic particles is to increase the magnetic field B
in time so as to keep f (Eq. 32–2) constant as the particles speed up. Such devices
are called synchrotrons; the particles move in a circle of fixed radius, which can
be very large. The larger the radius, the greater the 
of the particles can be for
a given magnetic field strength (see argument on previous page). The biggest 
synchrotron of all is at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is 4.3 km in radius,
and 27 km in circumference, and accelerates protons to 4 TeV (soon to be 
7 TeV).
The Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
near Chicago, Illinois, has a radius of 1.0 km.† The Tev
