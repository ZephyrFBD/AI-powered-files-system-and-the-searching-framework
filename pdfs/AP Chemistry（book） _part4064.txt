 Statement (b) is 
the best explanation. 12.13 (a) Hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole 
forces, London dispersion forces (b) covalent chemical bonds 
(c) ionic bonds (d) metallic bonds 12.15 (a) Ionic (b) metallic  
(c) covalent-network (It could also be characterized as ionic with 
some covalent character to the bonds.) (d) molecular (e) molecular 
(f) molecular 12.17 Metallic, because of its melting point, conduc-
tivity, and insolubility in water 
12.19 (a) 
Crystalline
 
(b) 
Amorphous

tinuous energy bands of molecular orbitals. 12.97 (a) False. As 
particle size decreases, the band gap increases. (b) False. As particle 
size decreases, wavelength decreases. 12.99 2.47 * 105 Au atoms 
12.101 Statement (b) is correct. 12.109 3 Ni atoms, 1 Al atom; 
6 Nb atoms, 2 Sn atoms; 1 Sm atom, 5 Co atoms. In each case, the 
atom ratio matches the empirical formula given in the exercise.
