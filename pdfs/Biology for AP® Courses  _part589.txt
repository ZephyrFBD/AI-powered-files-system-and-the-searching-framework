se passive movements. Much of a cell’s
supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes. (Most of a red blood cell’s metabolic energy is used
to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels required by the cell.) Because active
transport mechanisms depend on a cell’s metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere
with the supply of ATP.
Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and small molecules. Primary active transport
moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane, which is directly dependent on ATP.
Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by
primary active transport that does not directly require ATP.
