ll this relationship the equilibrium-constant expression (or merely the 
equilibrium expression) for the reaction. The constant Kc, the equilibrium con-
stant, is the numerical value obtained when we substitute molar equilibrium 
concentrations into the equilibrium-constant expression. The subscript c on the 
K indicates that concentrations expressed in molarity are used to evaluate the 
constant.
The numerator of the equilibrium-constant expression is the product of the 
concentrations of all substances on the product side of the equilibrium equation, 
each raised to a power equal to its coefficient in the balanced equation. The denom-
inator is similarly derived from the reactant side of the equilibrium equation. Thus,
