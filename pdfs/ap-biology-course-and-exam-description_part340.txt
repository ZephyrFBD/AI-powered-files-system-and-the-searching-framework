re 2, describe any significant change in the susceptibility of mosquitoes from 
region B to each of the two insecticides over the two-year period. Use the data in Table 1 to calculate the frequency 
of the allele coding for phenylalanine in each population of mosquitoes in October 2008. Round your answers to two 
decimal places.
(d) Using mosquitoes from insecticide-free areas, the scientists developed mosquito strains with amino acid substitutions 
at other positions in the sodium channel protein. They exposed the mosquito strains to nonpyrethroid insecticides. 
Predict the susceptibility of the mosquitoes to the insecticides. The scientists claim that the mosquito population of 
region B evolved resistance over the period of the experiment and that resistance arose as a result of the immigration of 
resistant mosquitoes from other regions. Based on the data in Table 1 and the information provided, provide evidence to 
support the scientists’ claim.
