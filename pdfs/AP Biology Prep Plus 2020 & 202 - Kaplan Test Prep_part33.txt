2. When a person exercises, muscles in the body convert energy
stored in complex molecules into kinetic energy. This action
releases a large amount of heat, which is transferred to the
surroundings. Which law of thermodynamics best explains why
this dissipation of heat occurs?
The first law of thermodynamics, because this is an example
of energy being created
(A)
The second law of thermodynamics, because this is an
example of energy being created
(B)
The first law of thermodynamics, because this is an example
of increasing entropy
(C)
The second law of thermodynamics, beca
