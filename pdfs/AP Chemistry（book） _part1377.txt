are minimized, as shown in Table 9.1.
 
3. Use the arrangement of the bonded atoms to determine the molecular geometry.
Table 9.2 summarizes the possible molecular geometries when an ABn molecule has 
four or fewer electron domains about A. These geometries are important because they 
include all the shapes usually seen in molecules or ions that obey the octet rule.
