. Light can also be
partially polarized.
When an unpolarized light beam passes through a Polaroid
sheet, the emerging beam is plane-polarized. When a light beam
is polarized and passes through a Polaroid, the intensity varies
as the Polaroid is rotated. Thus a Polaroid can act as a polarizer
or as an analyzer.
The intensity 
of a plane-polarized light beam incident on
a Polaroid is reduced to
(24;5)
where 
is the angle between the axis of the Polaroid and the
initial plane of polarization.
Light can also be partially or fully polarized by reflection.
If light traveling in air is reflected from a medium of index of
refraction n, the reflected beam will be completely plane-polarized
if the incident angle 
is given by
(24;6b)
The fact that light can be polarized shows that it must be a trans-
verse wave.
