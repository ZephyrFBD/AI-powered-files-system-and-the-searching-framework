f energy, followed by trophic level C, trophic level B, and then
trophic level D, which has the highest amount of energy. On a food chain, the
lower trophic levels like producers have more energy than higher trophic
levels such as tertiary consumers. Thus, the four trophic levels in order of
decreasing trophic levels are D, B, C, A. Arrows on a food chain represent
Identification (1 point each, 2 points maximum)
Here is a sample food chain that would receive full credit:
All four trophic levels in appropriate boxes
All four arrows correctly drawn between trophic levels
On a food chain, lower trophic levels have more energy than higher trophic levels; energy
decreases as it is used by organisms in each level.
Arrows on a food chain show the direction of the energy as it is transferred from one
organism to another.
energy flow and show the direction energy is transferred from one organism
to another. Energy flows from high quantities (low trophic levels) to low
quantities (high trophic l
