 molecule that requires a special receptor to
bring it into a cell. Choices B, C, and D are all about diffusion,
which does not require an expenditure of energy. (ENE-2)
(D) The plasma membrane is organized and made of many small
particles that move about readily. Hence the name, fluid mosaic. A
membrane is a very active structure. A cellâ€™s activity is limited by
how fast plasma membranes can take in and get rid of materials.
(SYI-1)
(C) The structure at X is a plasmodesma, an opening in plant cell
walls. It allows water and solutes to pass from one cell to another
continuously throughout the plant. It is a passive transport system
that works by diffusion. (ENE-2 & SYI-1)
(C) Part C points to the two hydrophobic lipid tails of every
phospholipid. Part A is a carbohydrate that is involved in cell-to-cell
identification; it is not involved in diffusion. Part B is a water-
soluble head of the phospholipids that make up the cell membrane.
Cholesterol floats within the membrane. Part D poin
