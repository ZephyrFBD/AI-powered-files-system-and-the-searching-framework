ION 14.7) A catalyst is a substance that increases 
the rate of a reaction without undergoing a net chemical change itself. 
It does so by providing a different mechanism for the reaction, one 
that has a lower activation energy. A homogeneous catalyst is one that is 
in the same phase as the reactants. A heterogeneous catalyst has a differ-
ent phase from the reactants. Finely divided metals are often used as 
heterogeneous catalysts for solution- and gas-phase reactions. Reacting 
molecules can undergo binding, or adsorption, at the surface of the cat-
alyst. The adsorption of a reactant at specific sites on the surface makes 
bond breaking easier, lowering the activation energy. Catalysis in living 
organisms is achieved by enzymes, large protein molecules that usu-
ally catalyze a very specific reaction. The specific reactant molecules 
involved in an enzymatic reaction are called substrates. The site of the 
enzyme where the catalysis occurs is called the active site. In the lock-
