H2S at 28 °C is 
3.5 * 10-2 M -1 s-1. If at a given time the concentration of 
H2S is 2.0 * 10 - 4 M and that of Cl2 is 0.025 M, what is the 
rate of formation of Cl -?
 14.91  The reaction 2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 NO21g2 is second 
order in NO and ﬁrst order in O2. When 3NO4 = 0.040 M, 
and 3O24 = 0.035 M, the observed rate of disappearance 
of NO is 9.3 * 10-5 M>s. (a) What is the rate of disappear-
ance of O2 at this moment? (b) What is the value of the 
rate constant? (c) What are the units of the rate constant? 
(d) What would happen to the rate if the concentration of 
NO were increased by a factor of 1.8?

CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
 14.100 Urea 1NH2CONH22 is the end product in protein metabo-
lism in animals. The decomposition of urea in 0.1 M HCl 
occurs according to the reaction
NH2CONH21aq2 + H +1aq2 +  
2 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 NH4
+1aq2 + HCO -
3 1aq2
 
 The reaction is ﬁrst order in urea and ﬁrst order overall. 
When 3NH2CONH24 = 0.200 M, the rate at 61.05 °C 
is 8.56 * 10-5 M>s. (a
