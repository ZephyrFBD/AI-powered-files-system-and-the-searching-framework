s still a hotly debated topic among scientists. Most scientists believe that the earliest precursors of life arose
from nonliving matter (basically, gases) in the primitive oceans of the earth. But this theory didn’t take shape until
the 1920s. Two scientists, Alexander Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane, proposed that the primitive atmosphere
contained mostly inorganic molecules and was rich in the following gases: methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3),
hydrogen (H2), and water (H2O). Interestingly enough, there was almost no free oxygen (O2) in this early
atmosphere. They believed that these gases collided, producing chemical reactions that eventually led to the organic
molecules we know today.
This theory didn’t receive any substantial support until 1953. In that year, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey
simulated the conditions of primitive Earth in a laboratory. They put the gases theorized to be abundant in the early
atmosphere into a flask, struck them with electrical charges in order to mimic light
