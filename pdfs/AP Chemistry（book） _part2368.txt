CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
The equilibrium mixture results because the reaction is reversible: N2O4 can form NO2, 
and NO2 can form N2O4. Dynamic equilibrium is represented by writing the equation for 
the reaction with two half arrows pointing in opposite directions  
 (Section 4.1):
 
N2O41g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2 
[15.1]
We can analyze this equilibrium using our knowledge of kinetics. Let’s call the 
decomposition of N2O4 the forward reaction and the formation of N2O4 the reverse reac-
tion. In this case, both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction are elementary reac-
tions. As we learned in Section 14.6, the rate laws for elementary reactions can be written 
from their chemical equations:
 
Forward reaction: N2O41g2 ¡ 2 NO21g2   Ratef = kf3N2O44 
[15.2]
 
Reverse reaction: 2 NO21g2 ¡  N2O41g2   Rater = kr3NO242 
[15.3]
At equilibrium, the rate at which NO2 forms in the forward reaction equals the rate 
at which N2O4 forms in the reverse reaction:
 
kf3N2O44 =
