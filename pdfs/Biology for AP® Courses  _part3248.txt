fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has a high density of
cones. When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the objectâ€™s image
falls on the fovea. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better
viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that
operate better in low light. In humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea.

Transduction of Light
The rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal. Both rods and cones contain photopigment
