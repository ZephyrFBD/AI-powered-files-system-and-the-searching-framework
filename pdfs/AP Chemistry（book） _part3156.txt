Oxidation States and Oxidation–
Reduction Reactions
We determine whether a given chemical reaction is an oxidation–reduction reaction 
by keeping track of the oxidation numbers (oxidation states) of the elements involved in 
the reaction. 
 (Section 4.4) This procedure identifies whether the oxidation number 
changes for any elements involved in the reaction. For example, consider the net reac-
tion that occurs spontaneously when zinc metal is added to a strong acid (Figure 20.1):
 
Zn1s2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡  Zn2+1aq2 + H21g2 
[20.1]
Assigning oxidation numbers to all species in the reaction, we have
