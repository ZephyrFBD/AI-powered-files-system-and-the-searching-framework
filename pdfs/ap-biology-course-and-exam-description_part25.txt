AP BIOLOGY
Introduction 
Given the speed with which scientific discoveries and 
research continuously expand scientific knowledge, 
many educators are faced with the challenge of 
balancing breadth of content coverage with depth 
of understanding. The AP Biology course outlined 
in this framework embraces this challenge by 
deemphasizing a traditional “content coverage” 
model of instruction in favor of one that focuses 
on enduring, conceptual understandings and the 
content that supports them. This approach enables 
students to spend less time on factual recall and 
more time on inquiry-based learning of essential 
concepts, helping them develop the reasoning skills 
necessary to engage in the science practices used 
throughout their study of AP Biology.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the breadth of 
content coverage in AP Biology is defined in a way 
that distinguishes content essential to support the 
enduring understandings from the many examples
