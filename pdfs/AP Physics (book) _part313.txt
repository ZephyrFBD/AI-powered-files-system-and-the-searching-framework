es approach each other head-on. Each has a
speed of 
and they spot each other when they are
initially 10.0 km apart. How much time do the pilots have
to take evasive action?
42. (II) A passenger on a boat moving at 
on a still lake
walks up a flight of stairs at a speed of 
Fig. 3–43.
The stairs are angled at 45° pointing in the direction of
motion as shown. What is the velocity of the passenger rel-
ative to the water?
0.60 ms,
1.70 ms
780 kmh,
10.0 m/s

43. (II) A person in the passenger basket of a hot-air balloon
throws a ball horizontally outward from the basket with
speed 
(Fig. 3–44). What initial velocity (magni-
tude and direction) does the ball have relative to a person
standing on the ground (a) if the hot-air balloon is rising
at
relative to the ground during this throw, (b) if
the hot-air balloon is descending at 
relative to the
ground?
3.0 ms
3.0 ms
10.0 ms
48. (II) A boat, whose speed in still water is 
must
cross a 285-m-wide river and arri
