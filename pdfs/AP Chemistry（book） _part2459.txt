constant increases with increasing temperature because the reaction is 
endothermic. It is necessary to use a log scale for Kp because the values 
vary over such a large range.
temperature of the exhaust gas. Some catalysts developed for this reaction 
are reasonably effective under the grueling conditions in automotive ex-
haust systems. Nevertheless, scientists and engineers are continuously 
searching for new materials that provide even more effective catalysis of 
the decomposition of nitrogen oxides.

contains less products than reactants and therefore lies toward the 
reactant side. The equilibrium-constant expression and the equilib-
rium constant of the reverse of a reaction are the reciprocals of those 
of the forward reaction. If a reaction is the sum of two or more reac-
tions, its equilibrium constant will be the product of the equilibrium 
constants for the individual reactions.
