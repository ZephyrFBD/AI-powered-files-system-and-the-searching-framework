ains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum,
Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in Figure
26.3 for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible. Dendrites are tree-like
structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called
synapses. Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can
have small protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.
Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized
structure, the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and
an axon. An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specializ
