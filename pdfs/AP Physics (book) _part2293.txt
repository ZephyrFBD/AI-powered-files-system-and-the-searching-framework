 it is moving slower than 
(e) Now consider electrons that move perpendicular to
both a magnetic field and to an electric field, which are
perpendicular to each other. If only electrons with speeds
of 
go straight through undeflected, what is
the ratio of the magnitudes of electric field to magnetic
field? Without knowing the value of the electric field, can
you know the value of the magnetic field?
3. (a) A particle of charge q moves in a circular path of 
radius r in a uniform magnetic field 
If the magnitude of
the magnetic field is double, and the kinetic energy of the
particle is the same, how does the angular momentum of
the particle differ? (b) Show that the magnetic dipole
moment M (Section 20â€“9) of an electron orbiting the
proton nucleus of a hydrogen atom is related to the orbital
angular momentum L of the electron by
M =
e
2m L.
