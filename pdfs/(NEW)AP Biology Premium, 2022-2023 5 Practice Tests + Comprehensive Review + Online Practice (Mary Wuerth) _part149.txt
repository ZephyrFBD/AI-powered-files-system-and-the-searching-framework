) Water will flow out of the plant cell because the plant cell has a total water potential that is higher than that
of the surrounding solution.

7. A freshwater fish is placed in a saltwater aquarium. Predict the most likely effect this will have on the fish, and
justify your prediction.
(A) The fish will gain water because it likely has a lower water potential than its new surroundings.
(B) The fish will lose water because it likely has a lower water potential than its new surroundings.
(C) The fish will gain water because it likely has a higher water potential than its new surroundings.
(D) The fish will lose water because it likely has a higher
