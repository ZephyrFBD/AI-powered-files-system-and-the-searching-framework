 new areas with food
shipments, allowing them to compete with native species
and disrupt ecosystems.
(A)
Pathogens can rapidly reach new locations via airplanes,
potentially harming human and animal populations.
(B)
Ship ballast water can contain living organisms, and these
can be transported to new destinations between ballast
water discharges.
(C)
Bacteria can develop resistance aȇer being exposed to
antibiotics, making the illnesses they cause harder to treat.

7. Figure A below shows the relative fitness of a prey species when
one or two predators are present. Figure B shows how the prey
phenotype is predicted to change depending on which predators
are present.
Which of the following conclusions can most reasonably be drawn
regarding this system?
