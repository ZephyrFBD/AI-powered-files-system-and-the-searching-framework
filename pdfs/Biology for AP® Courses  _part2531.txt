lso produce foodborne diseases because they
colonize the surfaces of food and food-processing equipment. Biofilms are resistant to most of the methods used to control
microbial growth. The excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in a major global problem, since resistant forms of bacteria
have been selected over time. A very dangerous strain, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has wreaked
havoc recently. Foodborne diseases result from the consumption of contaminated food, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or
parasites that contaminate food.

22.5 Beneficial Prokaryotes
Pathogens are only a small percentage of all prokaryotes. In fact, our life would not be possible without prokaryotes.
Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems; atmospheric nitrogen, the largest pool of available
nitrogen, is unavailable to eukaryotes. Nitrogen can be “fixed,” or converted into ammonia (NH3) either biologicall
