Laws of Probability
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P (A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 
If A and B are independent, then P (A and B) = P(A) x P(B) 
 
Hardy Weinberg Equations
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
p + q = 1 

s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample based 
estimate of the standard deviation of the population)  
x
p = frequency of the dominant allele 
in a population 
q = frequency of the recessive allele 
in a population 
= mean  
 
n = size of the sample 
o = observed individuals with observed genotype 
 
e = expected individuals with observed genotype 
 
Degrees of freedom equals the number of distinct
