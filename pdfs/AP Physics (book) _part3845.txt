l frame), there exists another pseudoforce known as the Coriolis force. It
appears to act on an object in a rotating reference frame only if the object is
moving relative to that rotating reference frame, and it acts to deflect the object
sideways. It, too, is an effect of the rotating reference frame being noninertial
and hence is referred to as an inertial force. It also affects the weather.
To see how the Coriolis force arises, consider two people, A and B, at rest 
on a platform rotating with angular speed 
as shown in Fig. C–2a. They are 
situated at distances 
and 
from the axis of rotation (at O). The woman at A
throws a ball with a horizontal velocity (in her reference frame) radially outward
toward the man at B on the outer edge of the platform. In Fig. C–2a, we view 
the situation from an inertial reference frame. The ball initially has not only the
velocity 
radially outward, but also a tangential velocity 
due to the rotation 
of the platform. Now Eq. 8–4 tells us that
wher
