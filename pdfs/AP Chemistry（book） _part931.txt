, n, l, and ml, which result nat-
urally from the mathematics used to describe an orbital.
1. The principal quantum number, n, can have positive integral values 1, 2, 3, . . . . As 
n increases, the orbital becomes larger, and the electron spends more time  
farther 
from the nucleus. An increase in n also means that the electron has a higher 
 
energy and is therefore less tightly bound to the nucleus. For the hydrogen atom, 
En = -12.18 * 10 - 18 J211>n22, as in the Bohr model.

This rendering represents the probability, 
c2, of finding the electron in a hydrogen 
atom in its ground state. The origin of the 
coordinate system is at the nucleus.
