ee copies of a given chromosome when there would
typically be two copies. Choice (B) is incorrect because haploidy describes the conditions where there is only
one copy of each chromosome. Monosomy is when there is one copy of a given chromosome, so choice (C) is
incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because diploidy describes the conditions where there are two copies of each
chromosome.
10. (C) Nondisjunction is when two homologous chromosomes do not separate during meiosis. If a nondisjunction
event occurs, the resulting gamete will have an extra copy of that chromosome. If that gamete is fertilized by a
haploid gamete, the resulting cell will have three copies of the chromosome, as shown in the figure.
Translocation describes mutations that are the result of genetic recombination between nonhomologous
chromosomes, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because independent assortment is the
independent alignment of pairs of homologous chromosomes in metaphase I; this does n
