students’ ability to determine 
scientific questions and methods. 
Students will need to identify or pose 
a testable question, state the null or 
alternative hypotheses or predict 
the results of an experiment, identify 
experimental procedures, and/or 
propose new investigations. 
Free-response questions 1 and 3

approximately half of the points for 
each question assessing this practice.
