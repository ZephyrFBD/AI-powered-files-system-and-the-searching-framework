hereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous
(Yy) genotype. When these plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the F1 self-fertilizing cross.
The Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype
Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed
a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. Called the
test cross, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is
crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism
is a homozygote, then all F1 offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (Figure 12.5). Alternatively, if
the dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote, the F1 offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive
homozygotes (Figure 12.5). The test cross further val
