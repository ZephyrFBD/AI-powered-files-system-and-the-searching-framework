Newton’s second law tells us that the acceleration of an object is proportional to
the net force acting on the object. The net force, as mentioned earlier, is the
vector sum of all forces acting on the object. Indeed, extensive experiments have
shown that forces do add together as vectors precisely according to the rules 
we developed in Chapter 3. For example, in Fig. 4–18, two forces of equal magni-
tude (100 N each) are shown acting on an object at right angles to each other.
Intuitively, we can see that the object will start moving at a 45° angle and thus 
the net force acts at a 45° angle. This is just what the rules of vector addition 
give. From the theorem of Pythagoras, the magnitude of the resultant force is
Adding force vectors. Calculate the sum of the two forces
