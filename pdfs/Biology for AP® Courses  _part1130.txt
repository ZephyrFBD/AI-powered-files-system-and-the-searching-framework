he former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. Each sister
chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region (Figure 10.8). The proteins of
the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes,
some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches
to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles.
Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle
microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other
midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in
spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.
