red blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and
bone cells that are deprived of nutrients begin to die.
2.
Within days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead
cells. Though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform
bone. Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone.
The repair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline
and fibrocartilage (Figure 29.22). Some bone spicules may also appear at this point.
3.
The fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone. It takes about two months for the broken
bone ends to be firmly joined together after the fracture. This is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as
cartilage becomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts,
