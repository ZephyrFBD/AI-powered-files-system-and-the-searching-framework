Since light carries off energy and energy is conserved, the electron’s own energy
must decrease to compensate. Hence electrons would be expected to spiral into the
nucleus. As they spiraled inward, their frequency would increase in a short time
and so too would the frequency of the light emitted. Thus the two main difficulties
of the Rutherford model are these: (1) it predicts that light of a continuous range of
frequencies will be emitted, whereas experiment shows line spectra; (2) it predicts
that atoms are unstable—electrons would quickly spiral into the nucleus—but we
know that atoms in general are stable, because there is stable matter all around us.
Clearly Rutherford’s model was not sufficient. Some sort of modification
was needed, and Niels Bohr provided it in a model that included the quantum
hypothesis. Although the Bohr model has been superseded, it did provide
