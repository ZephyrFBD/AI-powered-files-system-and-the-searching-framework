Nuclear Forces
We can analyze nuclei not only from the point of view of energy, but also from
the point of view of the forces that hold them together. We might not expect a
collection of protons and neutrons to come together spontaneously, since protons
are all positively charged and thus exert repulsive electric forces on each other.
Since stable nuclei do stay together, another force must be acting. This new force
has to be stronger than the electric force in order to hold the nucleus together, and
is called the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force acts as an attractive
force between all nucleons, protons and neutrons alike. Thus protons attract 
each other via the strong nuclear force at the same time they repel each other 
via the electric force. Neutrons, because they are electrically neutral, only attract
other neutrons or protons via the strong nuclear force.
The strong nuclear force turns out to be far more c
