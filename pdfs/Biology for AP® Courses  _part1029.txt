a receptor tyrosine kinase. In 30 percent of human breast cancers, HER2 is permanently
activated, resulting in unregulated cell division. Lapatinib, a drug used to treat breast cancer, inhibits
HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation (the process by which the receptor adds
phosphate onto itself), thus reducing tumor growth. Besides autophosphorylation, explain another
feature of the cell signaling pathway that can be affected by Lapatinib.
•
In certain cancers, the GTPase activity of RAS G-protein in inhibited. This means that the RAS G-
protein can no longer hydrolyze GTP into GDP. Explain what effect this would have on downstream
cellular events.
9.2 | Propagation of the Signal
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How does the binding of a ligand initiate signal transduction throughout a cell?
•
What is the role of second messengers in signal transduction?
