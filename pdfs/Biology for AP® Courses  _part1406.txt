ape, seed color, and
flower color. Evaluate the evidence provided by the
multiple-character experiments. Identify which of the
following laws of inheritance depend upon these multiple-
character experiments for support:
a.
During gamete formation, the alleles for each
gene segregate from each other so that each
gamete carries only one allele for each gene.
b.
Genes for different traits can segregate
independently during the formation of gametes.
c.
Some alleles are dominant, whereas others are
recessive. An organism with at least one
dominant allele will display the effect of the
dominant allele.
d.
All three laws can be inferred from the single-
character experiments.
C. As shown in the table above, some chromosomes
contain the gene for more than one of the seven
characteristics Mendel studied, for example, seed color
and flowers. The table below shows, with filled cells
above the dashed diagonal line, the combinations of
characteristics for which Mendel reported results. In the
cells
