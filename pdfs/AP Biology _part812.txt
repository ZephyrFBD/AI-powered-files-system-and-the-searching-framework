ion mean than a sample mean with a large
SE. Taking a larger sample size will usually result in a smaller SE. If the
sample mean is ±1 SE, the investigator can have an approximately 68%
confidence that the range includes the true population mean. Moreover, a
sample with a ±2 SE defines a range that has approximately a 95%
confidence. In other words, if the sampling was repeated 20 times with the

same sample size each time, the confidence limits would include the true
population mean almost every time.
Error bars are a graphical representation of the variability of data.
They are used on graphs to indicate how far from the reported value the
correct value might be. Error bars can represent different things, such as
standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), or a confidence interval (e.g.,
a 95% interval). Whatever the error bars represent must be clearly stated
on the graph.
