ses. A ball rolling downhill is exergonic process,
enthalpy decreases and no change in entropy.
c.
Compost pile decomposition is exergonic, enthalpy increases and entropy increases. A baby developing
from egg is an endergonic process, enthalpy decreases and entropy decreases. Sand art being destroyed
is exergonic, no change in enthalpy and entropy increases. A ball rolling downhill is exergonic process,
enthalpy decreases and entropy increases.
d.
A ball rolling down the hill doesnâ€™t affect the order of system; therefore, the entropy would remain
unchanged.
An important concept in the study of metabolism and energy is that of chemical equilibrium. Most chemical reactions are
reversible. They can proceed in both directions, releasing energy into their environment in one direction, and absorbing
it from the environment in the other direction (Figure 6.9). The same is true for the chemical reactions involved in cell
metabolism, such as the breaking down and building up of proteins into an
