two directions. One direction eventually led to one species, and the other eventually led to another
species.
For example, we have a common ancestor with chimps. This doesn’t mean that our great-great…great-grandfather
was a chimp. It means that chimps and we have the same great-great…great-grandfather, who was neither a human
nor a chimp. Instead, he was some other species completely, and a speciation event must have occurred where his
species was split and evolved in different directions. One lineage became chimps, and the other linage became
humans.
This is an example of a phylogenetic tree.
In this tree, the three main domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) are seen. You can see that plants,
animals, and fungi are much more closely related to each other than they are to bacteria. Archaea and eukarya have a
common ancestor with bacteria, and then they also have another common ancestor that bacteria doesn’t have.
In the phylogenetic tree above, species A is an out-group bec
