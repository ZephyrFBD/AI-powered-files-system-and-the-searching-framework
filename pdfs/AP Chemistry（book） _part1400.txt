or predicting molecular geometries but does 
not explain why bonds exist between atoms. In developing theories of covalent bonding, 
chemists have approached the problem from another direction, using quantum mechan-
ics. How can we use atomic orbitals to explain bonding and to account for molecular 
geometries? The marriage of Lewisâ€™s notion of electron-pair bonds and the idea of atomic 
orbitals leads to a model of chemical bonding, called valence-bond theory, in which 
bonding electron pairs are concentrated in the regions between atoms, and nonbonding 
electron pairs lie in directed regions of space. By extending this approach to include the 
ways in which atomic orbitals can mix with one another, we obtain an explanatory pic-
ture that corresponds to the VSEPR model.
In Lewis theory, covalent bonding occurs when atoms share electrons because the 
sharing concentrates electron density between the nuclei. In valence-bond theory, we 
visualize the buildup of electron density between t
