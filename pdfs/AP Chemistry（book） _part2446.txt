These equations are identical with one exception: the activation 
energies for the forward and reverse reactions are not the same, as 
shown on the left-hand side of Figure 15.15. For an endothermic reac-
tion, the activation energy in the forward direction is always larger 
than that of the reverse reaction, Ea(forward) 7 Ea(reverse). Conse-
quently, the decrease in the forward rate constant (Equation 15.29) 
will be larger than the decrease in the reverse rate constant (Equa-
tion 15.30), and the overall value of the equilibrium constant K must 
decrease.
For an exothermic reaction, Ea(reverse) 7 Ea(forward) and the 
opposite relationships apply as shown on the right-hand side of Fig-
ure 15.15. As temperature is lowered, the reverse rate constant will 
decrease more rapidly than the forw
