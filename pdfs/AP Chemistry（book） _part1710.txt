it is possible to estimate charges of +0.178 and -0.178 
for the hydrogen and chlorine ends of the HCl molecule, respectively (see Sample Exer-
cise 8.5). Furthermore, the distances between molecules are often larger than the dis-
tances between atoms held together by chemical bonds.
Dispersion Forces
You might think there would be no electrostatic interactions between electrically neu-
tral, nonpolar atoms and/or molecules. Yet some kind of attractive interactions must 
exist because nonpolar gases like helium, argon, and nitrogen can be liquefied. Fritz Lon-
don, a German-American physicist, first proposed the origin of this attraction in 1930. 
London recognized that the motion of electrons in an atom or molecule can create an 
instantaneous, or momentary, dipole moment.
In a collection of helium atoms, for example, the average distribution of the electrons 
about each nucleus is spherically symmetrical, as shown in Figure 11.4(a). The atoms are 
nonpolar and so possess no permanent
