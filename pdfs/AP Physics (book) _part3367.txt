rt in energy than those of an atom:
on the order of keV or MeV, as compared to a few eV for electrons in an atom.
Hence, the emitted photons have energies that can range from a few keV to
several MeV. For a given decay, the 
ray always has the same energy. Since a 
ray carries no charge, there is no change in the element as a result of a decay.
How does a nucleus get into an excited state? It may occur because of a vio-
lent collision with another particle. More commonly, the nucleus remaining after
a previous radioactive decay may be in an excited state. A typical example is shown
