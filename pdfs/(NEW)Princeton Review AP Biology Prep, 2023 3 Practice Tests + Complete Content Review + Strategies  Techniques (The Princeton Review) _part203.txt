r side of a membrane, for example.
The only difference is the type of membrane.
Don’t Forget the Formula Sheet!
Be sure to look at the Equations and Formulas sheet to be prepared for
questions about water potential and solute potential.
Water potential (Ψ) is the measure of potential energy in water and describes the eagerness of water to flow from
an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. It is affected by two factors: pressure potential (Ψp)
and solute potential (Ψs). The equation for solute (osmotic) potential is listed on the AP Biology Equations and
Formulas sheet and describes the effect of solute concentration on water flow.
Water Potential Equations
Ψ = Ψp + Ψs
Ψp = pressure potential
Ψs = solute potential
Solute Potential of a Solution
Ψs = −iCRT
where:
i = ionization constant
C = molar concentration
R = pressure constant
T = temperature in Kelvin (°C + 273)
Adding a solute lowers the water potential of a solution, causing water to be less likely to le
