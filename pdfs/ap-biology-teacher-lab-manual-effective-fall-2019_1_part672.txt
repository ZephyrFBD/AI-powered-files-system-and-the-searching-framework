 be inferred from 
biomass gained and lost. In your lab notebook, develop a system diagram, such as Figure 
3, to model energy flow from Fast Plants to cabbage butterfly larvae. Before taking any 
measurements, predict the input and the output of energy in the butterfly larvae you will 
be growing. Enter these predictions in your lab notebook.

Step 2 As butterfly larvae grow toward maturity, they pass through different 
developmental stages called instars. You will use larvae that are already well along their 
developmental path through the larval stages (4th or 5th instar). These larvae first 
grew on young Fast Plants, and they were later transferred to brussels sprouts (another 
member of the cabbage family) in a Brassica Barn (see Figure 4). For this part of the 
investigation, you and your lab team need to develop a procedure that will quantify the 
growth of butter
