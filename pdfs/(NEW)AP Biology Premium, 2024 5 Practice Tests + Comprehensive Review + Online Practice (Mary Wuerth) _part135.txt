als with its
environment is the surface area to volume ratio. For the cylinder, the ratio is 
. For the sphere, the
ratio is 
. For the cube, the ratio is 
.
(b) The independent variable is the shape of the agar block. The dependent variable is the time it takes for the
vinegar to diffuse completely into the cell and turn it yellow.
(c) The cube would turn completely yellow first.
(d) The greater a cellâ€™s surface area to volume ratio, the more efficiently it will exchange materials with its
environment. Since the cube has the greatest surface area to volume ratio, it will exchange materials the
most efficiently and turn completely yellow first.
12. (a) The lysosome is most likely to participate in apoptosis because it contains hydrolytic enzymes that can
break down parts of the cell.
(b) Other functions of the lysosome are to assist in digestion by breaking down large macromolecules and
destroying bacteria or viruses that invade the cell.
(c) The hydrolytic enzymes in the lysosome are
