is done on the cristae. Having folds in the membrane increases the surface area for making ATP.
Lysosomes
Throughout the cell are small, membrane-enclosed structures called lysosomes. These tiny sacs carry digestive
enzymes, which they use to break down old, worn-out organelles, debris, or large ingested particles. Lysosomes
make up the cell’s clean-up crew, helping to keep the cytoplasm clear of unwanted flotsam and recycling organic
materials. Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes that function only at acidic pH, which is enclosed inside the
lumen of the lysosome. Lysosomes are made when vesicles containing specific enzymes from the trans Golgi fuse
with vesicles made during endocytosis (which you’ll learn about in a bit). Lysosomes are also essential during
programmed cell death called apoptosis.
There are lots of examples in biology in which folding is used to increase
surface area. This is similar to the surface area-to-volume ratio concept we
mentioned earlier. Some common example
