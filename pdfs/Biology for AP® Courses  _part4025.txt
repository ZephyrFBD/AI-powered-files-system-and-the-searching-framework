the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female’s body for internal fertilization, or
the sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. Seahorses, like the one shown in Figure

brood pouch where they are fertilized. The eggs hatch and the offspring develop in the pouch for several weeks.
Some animals are able to reproduce asexually by a process called parthenogenesis. While this process is common in
invertebrate animals, it is rare in vertebrates. At first scientists thought that vertebrate parthenogenesis happened only with
captive animals, such as birds, snakes, and sharks; however, it was recently discovered that about one in five smalltooth
sawfish in Florida is the result of parthenogenesis. This species of fish is endangered, and researchers suspect that this form
