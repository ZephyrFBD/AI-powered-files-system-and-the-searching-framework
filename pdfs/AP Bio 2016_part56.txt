opulations and the females are from the other population. The 
fertility and viability of the offspring from each mating are indicated in the figures.

13. Based on the model of speciation presented, 
which of the following describes the most likely 
consequence to the populations over time? 
(A) Hybrid individuals are less likely to pass  
their genetic information on to subsequent 
generations. 
(B) Hybrid individuals living together are 
physically unable to mate with each other. 
(C) Geographically isolated populations 
gradually acquire similar heritable traits. 
(D) Differences between hybrid individuals of
