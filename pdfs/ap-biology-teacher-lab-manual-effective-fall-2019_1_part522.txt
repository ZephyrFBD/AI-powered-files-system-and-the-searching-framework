p of a closed tube 
between the index finger and thumb of one hand and gently flick the bottom of the 
tube with the index finger of the other hand. (You should demonstrate this technique.) 
After transferring bacteria to an agar plate, the students should cover the plates with 
lids immediately after pipetting in the transformation culture and spreading the cells. 
They should spread the suspension evenly around the surface of the agar by quickly 
skating the flat surface of a new sterile loop back and forth across the plate surface. An 
alternative method is to use small sterile glass beads to spread the suspensions by gently 
rocking the beads across the surface of the agar. 
Remind students to store their plates in the incubator upside down to prevent any 
condensation from dripping onto the agar.

The Getting Started section of the investigation contains two sets of questions 
for preparing students and encourages them to
