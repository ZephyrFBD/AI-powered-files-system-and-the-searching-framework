 
chemistry is the liter (L), which equals a cubic decimeter, dm3, and is slightly larger than 
a quart. (The liter is the first metric unit we have encountered that is not an SI unit.) There 
are 1000 milliliters (mL) in a liter, and 1 mL is the same volume as 1 cm3: 1 mL = 1 cm3.

Density
Density is defined as the amount of mass in a unit volume of a substance:
 
density =

In the lab, you will likely use the devices in Figure 1.21 to measure and deliver volumes 
of liquids. Syringes, burettes, and pipettes deliver amounts of liquids with more precision 
than graduated cylinders. Volumetric
