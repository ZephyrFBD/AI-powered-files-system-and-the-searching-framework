that generates the electrical pulses needed to trigger the contrac-
tions of the heart.
During the late 1800s, scientists discovered that the electrical 
impulses that cause the contraction of the heart muscle are strong 
enough to be detected at the surface of the body. This observation 
formed the basis for electrocardiography, noninvasive monitoring 
of the heart by using a complex array of electrodes on the skin to 
measure voltage changes during heartbeats. A typical electrocar-
diogram is shown in Figure 20.17. It is quite striking that, alth
