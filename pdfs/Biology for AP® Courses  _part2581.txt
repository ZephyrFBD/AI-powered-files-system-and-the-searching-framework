rial infections caused by
antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
ATP synthesis in prokaryotes is accomplished by a protein
that connects the extracellular space to the cytoplasm. In
gram-negative bacteria, the proton gradient that supplies
the free energy to convert ADP into ATP is established
across the inner membrane.
B. Predict differences in the interactions of eukaryotic and
prokaryotic cells with a drug molecule that successfully
targets ATP synthesis and provide reasoning for your

predictions.
In gram-positive bacteria, ATP synthesis is accomplished
by a protein that spans the single membrane and the outer
cell wall. During the production of yogurt and wine, which
rely on gram-positive bacteria, the pH is controlled.
Sodium bicarbonate secretions from the pancreas maintain
the pH of the human intestine, where many beneficial
methanogens are gram-positive bacteria.
C. Explain why homeostasis for gram-positive bacteria
