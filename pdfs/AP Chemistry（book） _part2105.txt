ermediate types of dispersions 
are called either colloidal dispersions or simply colloids. Colloids form the dividing 
line between solutions and heterogeneous mixtures. Like solutions, colloids can be gases, 
liquids, or solids. Examples of each are listed in Table 13.5.
Particle size can be used to classify a mixture as colloid or solution. Colloid particles 
range in diameter from 5 to 1000 nm; solute particles are smaller than 5 nm in diameter. 
The nanomaterials we saw in Chapter 12 
 (Section 12.9), when dispersed in a liquid, 
unit; for K2SO4 it is 3 because K2SO4 consists of two K+ and one SO4
2- per 
formula unit. In the absence of any information about the actual value 
of i for a solution, we will use the limiting value in calculations.
Two trends are evident in Table 13.4, which gives measured 
vanâ€™t Hoff factors for several substances at different dilutions. First, 
dilution affects the value of i for electrolytes; the more dilute the 
solution, the more closely i approac
