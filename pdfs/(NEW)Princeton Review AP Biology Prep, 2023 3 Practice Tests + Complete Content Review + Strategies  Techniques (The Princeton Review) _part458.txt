e period of 1980 to 2000, the average pH in Richard Creek changed drastically. An ecological survey was
performed to evaluate the effect of detectable decreases in pH on the aquatic life of the creek. Four times a year,
ecological surveys were performed to identify the number of snails (a primary consumer), crayfish (a secondary
consumer), and brook trout (a tertiary consumer) present at five different locations. The percent change relative to
1980 is shown in Figure 1 above. Many aquatic organisms cannot live in low pH conditions. The minimum pH
necessary for common aquatic organisms to sustain life is shown in Table 1.
4. According to the data in Figure 1 and Table 1, the average pH in the creek is most nearly which of the
following?
(A) 5.9
(B) 5.5
(C) 5.1
(D) 4.7
5. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the abrupt decrease in pH in Richard Creek?
(A) Greenhouse effect
(B) Deforestation
(C) Acid rain
(D) Pollution
