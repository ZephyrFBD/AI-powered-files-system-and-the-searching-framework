•  Structured: Students investigate a teacher-presented question through a prescribed 
procedure. 
•  Guided: Students investigate a teacher-presented question using student-designed/ 
selected procedures. 
•  Open: Students investigate topic-related questions that are formulated through 
student-designed/selected procedures. 
In student-directed, inquiry-based laboratory investigations, students model the 
behavior of scientists by discovering knowledge for themselves as they observe and 
explore. Beginning with observations, students employ a variety of methods to 
answer questions that they have posed. These include conducting laboratory and field 
investigations; manipulating software simulations, models, and data sets; and exploring 
meaningful online research (Waterman 2008). By designing experiments to test 
hypotheses, analyze data, and communicate results and conclusions, students learn that a 
scientific method of investigation is cycl
