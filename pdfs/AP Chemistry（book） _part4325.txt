tal is entirely analogous to an atomic orbital, which is an 
allowed state for an electron in an atom. Most bonding molecular 
orbitals can be classified as s or p, depending on the disposition of 
electron density with respect to the internuclear axis. (Section 9.7)
molecular-orbital diagram A diagram that shows the energies 
of molecular orbitals relative to the atomic orbitals from which 
they are derived; also called an energy-level diagram. 
(Section 9.7)
molecular-orbital theory A theory that accounts for the 
allowed states for electrons in molecules by using specific wave 
functions. (Section 9.7)
molecular solids Solids that are composed of molecules held 
together by their intermolecular forces. (Sections 12.1 and 12.6)
molecular weight The sum of the atomic weights (AW) of the 
atoms represented by their chemical formula for a molecule.
