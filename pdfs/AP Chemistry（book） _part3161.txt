In many simple chemical equations, such as Equation 20.2, balancing the elec-
trons is handled “automatically”—that is, we balance the equation without explicitly 
accounting for the transfer of electrons. Many redox equations are more complex than 
Equation 20.2, however, and cannot be balanced easily without taking into account 
the number of electrons lost and gained. In this section, we examine the method of half- 
reactions, a systematic procedure for balancing redox equations.

Although oxidation and reduction must take place simultaneously, it is often convenient 
to consider them as separate processes. For example, the oxidation of Sn2+ by Fe3+,
 
Sn2+1aq2 + 2 Fe3+1aq2 ¡ Sn4+1aq2 + 2 Fe2+1aq2 
can be considered as consisting of two processes: oxidation of Sn2+ and reduction of Fe3+:
 
Oxidation:  Sn2+1aq2 ¡ Sn4+1aq2 + 2 e-

Reduction: 2 Fe3+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ 2 Fe2+1aq2
