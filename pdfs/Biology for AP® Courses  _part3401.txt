s are primarily controlled through negative feedback, in which rising levels of a hormone inhibit its further
release. The three mechanisms of hormonal release are humoral stimuli, hormonal stimuli, and neural stimuli. Humoral

stimuli refers to the control of hormonal release in response to changes in extracellular fluid levels or ion levels. Hormonal
stimuli refers to the release of hormones in response to hormones released by other endocrine glands. Neural stimuli refers
to the release of hormones in response to neural stimulation.
28.5 Endocrine Glands
The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is attached to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum. The
anterior pituitary receives products from the hypothalamus by the hypophyseal portal system and produces six hormones.
The posterior pituitary is an extension of the brain and releases hormones (antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin) produced
by the hypothalamus.
The thyroid gland is l
