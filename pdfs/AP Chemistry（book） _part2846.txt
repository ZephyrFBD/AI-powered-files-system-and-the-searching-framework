solution. The solution is filtered, and a 50.00-mL sample 
titrated with HCl requires 11.23 mL of 0.0983 M HCl to 
reach the end point. Calculate Ksp for Ca1OH22. Compare 
your result with that in Appendix D. Suggest a reason for 
any differences you find between your value and the one in 
Appendix D.
 17.116  The osmotic pressure of a saturated solution of strontium 
sulfate at 25 °C is 21 torr. What is the solubility product of 
this salt at 25 °C?
 17.117  A concentration of 10–100 parts per billion (by mass) of Ag+ 
is an effective disinfectant in swimming pools. However, if 
the concentration exceeds this range, the Ag+ can cause 
adverse health effects. One way to maintain an appropri-
ate concentration of Ag+ is to add a slightly soluble salt to 
the pool. Using Ksp values from Appendix D, calculate the 
equilibrium concentration of Ag+ in parts per billion that 
would exist in equilibrium with (a) AgCl, (b) AgBr, (c) AgI.
