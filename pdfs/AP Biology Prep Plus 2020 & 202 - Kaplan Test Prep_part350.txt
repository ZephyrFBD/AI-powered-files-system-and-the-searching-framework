ate cofactor or coenzyme, an enzyme will be less
capable of catalyzing its reaction and may even lose its function entirely.
As a consequence, compounds that must be synthesized to maintain
homeostasis and growth could become deficient or waste products that,
should they be broken down, could accumulate to toxic levels. This is
why vitamins and minerals are such essential aspects of nutrition.

The figure above compares an uncatalyzed reaction with an
enzymatically catalyzed reaction. The activation energy, or energy that is
required to start up the reaction, is much lower in the catalyzed reaction,
yet the overall free energy change (ΔG) is the same for both reactions. The
laws of thermodynamics can be used to predict if a reaction will occur or
not. If products have less free energy (G) than the reactants, the reaction
has an overall
