a staining results in
approximately 400â€“800 bands (of tightly coiled DNA and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23
chromosome pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to the banding patterns,
chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the classic
depiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order
from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually
arranges the chromosomes into this pattern (Figure 13.5).
At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or
too few chromosomes per cell. Examples of this are Down Syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of
chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome
in women instead of the normal two. Geneticists can also identify large deletions or inserti
