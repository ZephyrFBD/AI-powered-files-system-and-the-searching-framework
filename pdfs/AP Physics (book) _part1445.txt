temperature; the point c (the one point where curve C is horizontal) is called the
critical point. At temperatures less than the critical temperature, a gas will change
to the liquid phase if sufficient pressure is applied. Above the critical tempera-
ture (and this is the definition of the term), no amount of pressure can cause a gas
to change phase and become a liquid. (Thus curves A and B represent the sub-
stance at temperatures where it can only be a gas.) The critical temperatures for
various gases are given in Table 13–2. Scientists tried for many years to liquefy
oxygen without success, which led to the idea that there must be a critical point.
Oxygen can be liquefied only if first cooled below its critical temperature of –118°C.
