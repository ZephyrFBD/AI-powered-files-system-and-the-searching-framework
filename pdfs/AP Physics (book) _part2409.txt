29. (I) A step-up transformer increases 25 V to 120 V. What is
the current in the secondary coil as compared to the primary
coil?
30. (I) Neon signs require 12 kV for their operation. To operate
from a 240-V line, what must be the ratio of secondary to
primary turns of the transformer? What would the voltage
output be if the transformer were connected in r
