r metabolic rates are very high, which means they digest their food very quickly and need to eat often.
Contrast this with the ruminants, where the digestion of plant matter takes a very long time.
Although both birds and humans are vertebrates, birds have a relatively higher metabolic rate than humans.
a. Why is the metabolic rate of birds relatively higher than that of humans?
b. How do birds compensate for such a high metabolism?
a.
a. Birds have smaller surfaces to lose heat than humans, so their metabolic rate must be higher.
b. Birds need to eat greater amounts of food since they digest food quickly.
b.
a. Birds need to be light to fly, so they need to digest their food faster than humans.
b. Birds need to eat greater amounts of food since they digest food quickly.
c.
a. Birds have smaller surfaces to lose heat than humans, so their metabolic rate must be higher.
b. Birds need to eat often to maintain energy since they digest food quickly.
d.
a. Birds need to be light to fly, so
