Photosynthetic activity can be measured using chloroplasts suspended in a buffered solution containing DCPIP, a 
dye that can accept electrons from the electron transport chain of photosynthesis. Transfer of electrons to DCPIP 
decreases the relative absorbance of a specific wavelength of light (605 nm) by a solution that contains the dye. 
 
A buffered solution containing chloroplasts and DCPIP was divided equally among six identical samples. The 
samples were placed at
