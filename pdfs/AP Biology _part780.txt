at is called
epibolic movement, the blastocoel disappears and is replaced by another
cavity called the archenteron. The region of mesoderm lining the
archenteron that formed opposite the blastopore is called the dorsal
mesoderm.
Organogenesis: In chordates, the organs that form first are the
notochord, the skeletal rod that is characteristic of all chordate embryos,
and the neural tube, which will become the central nervous system. The
neural tube forms from the dorsal ectoderm just above the notochord.
Both form by embryonic induction (see “Embryonic Induction” on page
397). After the blueprints of the organs are laid down, the embryo
develops into a larval stage: the tadpole. Later, metamorphosis will
transform the tadpole into a frog.
The Bird Embryo
Cleavage and gastrulation: The bird’s egg has so much yolk that
development of the embryo occurs in a flat disc or blastodisc that sits on
top of the yolk. A primitive streak forms instead of a gray crescent. Cells
migrate over the prim
