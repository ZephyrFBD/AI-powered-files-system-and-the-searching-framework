membranous sacs with or without
ribosomes attached Rough ER—has ribosomes Smooth ER
—no ribosomes
Sites of protein and membrane
synthesis, including detoxification
of drugs
Golgi Apparatus Rows of flattened, membranous sacs
Modifies and transports proteins,
etc., for export from the cell;
synthesizes carbohydrates
Ribosome(s)
Tiny organelles; no membrane; contain rRNA and protein;
bound to ER or float free in cytoplasm
Sites of protein synthesis
Lysosome(s)
Small, spherical; surrounded by one membrane; contains
hydrolytic enzymes
Aids in phagocytosis and
intracellular digestion
Vacuoles
Small or large; surrounded by single membrane
Provides turgor pressure for gross
plant support; storage of substances
Chloroplast
(Type of Plastid)
Various membrane-bound organelles; chloroplast has
double membrane plus thylakoids shaped like stacked
coins to increase surface area
Site of photosynthesis; other
plastids store starch or fats
Cytoskeleton
Network of microfilaments and microtubules througho
