ng to the
following equation:
Energy = Biomass in grams × 4.35 kcal/gram
Let’s look at a sample set of data for 10 plants grown over seven days. In
seven days, the 10 plants gain 4.2 grams of dry mass. Using the equation,
you can determine that 4.2 grams of dry mass is equivalent to 18.27 kcal
of energy captured from the Sun. To determine the net primary
productivity per plant per day, you must divide that total amount of
energy by 10 plants and by seven days. In this example, the net primary
productivity is 0.26 kcal per plant per day.

The eﬀiciency of energy transfer from producer to primary consumers
varies with the type of organism and with the characteristics of the
ecosystem. In the second part of the investigation, determine the
biomass change in butterfly larvae that eat your plants to evaluate the
energy use of primary consumers an
