te molecules can be held in a certain orientation to
facilitate a reaction. The two models of enzyme-substrate interaction are
shown below. In the lock-and-key model, the spatial structure of an
enzyme’s active site is exactly complementary to the spatial structure of
the substrate so that the enzyme and substrate fit together like a lock and
key. In the induced fit model, the active site has a flexibility that allows the
3-D shape of the enzyme to shiȇ to accommodate the incoming substrate
molecule.
COFACTORS AND COENZYMES
Most enzymes require cofactors to become active. Cofactors are
nonprotein (inorganic) species that either play a role in binding to the

substrate or stabilize the enzyme’s active conformation. Two examples of
cofactors are zinc and the iron in hemoglobin.
Coenzymes are other organic molecules that play a similar role. Most
coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body but are obtained from the
diet as vitamins.
