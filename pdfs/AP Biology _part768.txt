The epididymis is the tube in the testes where sperm gain motility.
Leydig cells are clusters of cells, located between seminiferous
tubules, that produce testosterone.
The prostate gland is the large gland that secretes semen directly
into the urethra.
The scrotum is the sac outside the abdominal cavity that holds the
testes. The cooler temperature there enables sperm to survive.
Seminal vesicles secrete mucus, fructose sugar (which provides
energy for the sperm), and the hormone prostaglandin (which

Seminiferous tubules are the site of sperm formation in the testes.
Sertoli cells provide nutrients for developing sperm.
