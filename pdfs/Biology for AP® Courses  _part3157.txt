This figure shows the transmission of a signal among a
network of neurons. How is a signal transferred from one
neuron to another?
a.
A signal is released from an axon, passes
through the axon terminal, and synapses with
dendrites. Dendrites receive the signal, which
passes through the soma. Multiple signals from a
single synapse are integrated at the axon hillock,
which then passes the signal into the axon,
where the signal is transferred to another cell.
b.
A signal is released from axon terminal, passes
through the axon, and synapse with dendrites.
Dendrites receive the signal, which passes
through the soma. Multiple signals from
multiple synapses are integrated at the axon
hillock, which then passes the signal into the
axon, where the signal is transferred to another
cell.
c.
A signal is released from an axon and passes
through the axon terminal, which synapses with
dendrites. Dendrites receive the signal as it
passes through the soma. Multiple si
