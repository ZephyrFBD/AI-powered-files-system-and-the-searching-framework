Figure 19.15 A biologist is using a simulation to model
populations of African hornbills (Bycanistes spp. and
Ceratogymna spp.), a keystone species of the savanna.
Populations of the birds are declining due to habitat loss.
The hornbillâ€™s diet consists primarily of termites and fruit.
A critical component of termite digestion is chitin
deacetylase, an enzyme whose mutation rate is a model
parameter. The other model parameter is population size,
N. In the results of the simulation study shown above,
there is no selection, and the mutation rate is fixed.
Although both population size and mutation rate are fixed,
randomness results in the five different outcomes shown in
each graph above.
A. Select the graph displaying the results that are closer to
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Justify the selection of the
graph.
B. Based on these simulations, predict the future
heterozygosity, 2pq, of the smaller populations, as shown
in graph A.
C. Justify the
