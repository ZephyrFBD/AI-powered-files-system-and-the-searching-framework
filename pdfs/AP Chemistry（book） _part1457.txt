oms and molecules, we are mainly inter-
ested in determining two characteristics of the electrons—their ener-
gies and their distribution in space. Recall that solving Schrödinger’s 
wave equation yields the electron’s energy, E, and wave function, c, 
but that c does not have a direct physical meaning.
 (Section 6.5) 
The contour representations of atomic and molecular orbitals we 
have presented thus far are based on c2 (the probability density), 
which gives the probability of finding the electron at a given point 
in space.
Because probability densities are squares of functions, their val-
ues must be nonnegative (zero or positive) at all points in space. How-
ever, the functions themselves can have negative values. The situation 
is like that of the sine function plotted in Figure 9.37. In the top 
graph, the sine function is negative for x between 0 and -p and pos-
itive for x between 0 and +p. We say that the phase of the sine func-
tion is negative between 0 and -p and positive
