oduce the hormone insulin. These hormones regulate blood glucose levels. As
blood glucose levels decline, alpha cells release glucagon to raise the blood glucose levels by increasing rates of glycogen
breakdown and glucose release by the liver. When blood glucose levels rise, such as after a meal, beta cells release insulin to
lower blood glucose levels by increasing the rate of glucose uptake in most body cells, and by increasing glycogen synthesis
in skeletal muscles and the liver. Together, glucagon and insulin regulate blood glucose levels.
