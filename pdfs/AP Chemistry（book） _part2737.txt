 volume needed to reach the equivalence point. The point 
in a titration where the indicator changes color is called the end 
point to distinguish it from the equivalence point that it closely 
approximates.
Go Figure
How does the pH at the equivalence point change as the 
acid being titrated becomes weaker? How does the volume 
of NaOH(aq) needed to reach the equivalence point change?

▲ Figure 17.11 A set of curves showing the effect of acid strength 
on the characteristics of the titration curve when a weak acid is 
titrated by a strong base. Each curve represents titration of 50.0 mL 
of 0.10 M acid with 0.10 M NaOH.
Figure 17.12 shows the curve for titration of a 
strong base (NaOH) with a strong acid (HCl). We 
see from the vertical part of the curv
