nce d is
connected to a battery of constant voltage V and acquires a charge Q. While it
is still connected to the battery, a slab of dielectric material with
is inserted
between the plates of the capacitor. Will Q increase, decrease, or stay the same?
RESPONSE Since the capacitor remains connected to the battery, the voltage
stays constant and equal to the battery voltage V. The capacitance C increases
when the dielectric material is inserted because K in Eq. 17–9 has increased.
From the relation
if V stays constant, but C increases, Q must increase
as well. As the dielectric is inserted, more charge will be pulled from the battery
and deposited onto the plates of the capacitor as its capacitance increases.
Q = CV,
K = 3
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17;9
EXERCISE F If the dielectric in Example 17–9 fills the space between the plates, by
what factor does (a) the capacitance change, (b) the charge on each plate change?
Inserting a dielectric into an isolated
capacitor. Suppose the air-filled capac
