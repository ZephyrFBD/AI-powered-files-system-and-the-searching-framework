 of the road over another.
b. Complete the table with the average data and values necessary to test the hypothesis. (All white empty blanks
should be filled.)
c. Use statistics to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
Since our degree of freedom is 1 and we are using p = 0.05, our critical value is 3.841. Our Ï‡2 value is less than our
critical value, so we fail to reject our null hypothesis.
d. Explain how the results of the experiment support the theory that animal behavior changes as their
environment changes.
According to our data, the squirrels do not prefer one side of the road over the other. As the road was
constructed, what was likely a continuous forest became separated. As both pine trees and maples provide food and
shelter resources, the squirrels have adapted to the change in their habitat by migrating to both sides of the road
frequently.
(Any answer properly linking the experimental data to changes in the environment and the squirrel behavior
