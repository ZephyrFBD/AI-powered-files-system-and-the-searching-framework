In the laboratory, NH3 can be prepared by the action of NaOH on an ammonium 
salt. The NH4
+ ion, which is the conjugate acid of NH3, transfers a proton to OH -. The 
resultant NH3 is volatile and is driven from the solution by mild heating:
 
NH4Cl1aq2 + NaOH1aq2 ¡ NH31g2 + H2O1l2 + NaCl1aq2

Commercial production of NH3 is achieved by the Haber proce
