must first break it down into glucose. Animals,
however, are unable to hydrolyze cellulose because they do not have the
enzymes that break down the beta linkages. In animals, glycogen (a
glucose polymer similar to starch, but containing branches) is a form of
energy storage and chitin (analogous in structure to cellulose) provides
support.
LIPIDS
Lipids store energy, contribute to cell membrane structure, protect
against desiccation, and provide building blocks for hormones. A
subgroup of lipids is fatty acids, which consist of a long hydrocarbon
chain attached to a carboxyl group. The length of fatty acid chains ranges
from 4–36 carbons but is usually 12–18 carbons. If the fatty acid contains
only single bonds in the hydrocarbon chain, it is saturated with hydrogen
atoms and thus called a saturated fatty acid. A double bond between
carbons in the hydrocarbon chain causes the fatty acid to become
unsaturated. Fatty acids may diﬀer in their degree of unsaturation.
