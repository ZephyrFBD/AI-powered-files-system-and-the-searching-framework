used
by an eyeball that is too short. For both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry. Myopia
(nearsightedness) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina. In this case, images
in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear.
There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: rods and cones, named for their general appearance as illustrated in
Figure 27.18. Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina. They detect dim light and
are used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision. Cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of
the retina. They respond to bright light, and their primary role is in daytime, color vision.

Figure 27.18 Rods and cones are photoreceptors in the retina. Rods respond in low light and can detect only shades
of gray. Cones respond in intense light and are responsible for color vision.
