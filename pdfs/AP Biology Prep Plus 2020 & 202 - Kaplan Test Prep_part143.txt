crotubule triplets, which are called basal bodies.
Because the microtubules in cilia and flagella must be rebuilt oȇen,
tubulin dimers use these basal bodies as the foundation to make new
microtubules, which are used to maintain cilia and flagella.
As you can see in the following figure, cilia and flagella are composed of
long stabilized microtubules arranged in a “9 + 2” structure (nine pairs of
microtubules surrounding two central microtubules for added stability).
These nine doublets slide past each other as dynein proteins grab
neighboring tubules and pull them. This rapid sliding generates the force
needed for the cilia or flagella to quickly beat back and forth and cause
movement.
