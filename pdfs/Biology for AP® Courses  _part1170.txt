E6, a protein that binds p53. Predict the
most likely effect of E6 binding on p53 activity, and explain the basis for your prediction.
10.5 | Prokaryotic Cell Division
In this section, you will explore the following question:
â€¢
How does the process of binary fission in prokaryotes differ from cell division in eukaryotes?
Prokaryotes, such as bacteria, propagate by binary fission. For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to
produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter
cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.
To achieve the outcome of cloned offspring, certain steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then
allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to
sustain life. In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA
