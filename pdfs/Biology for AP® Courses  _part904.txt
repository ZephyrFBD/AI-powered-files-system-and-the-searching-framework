rane.
B. Explain how DNP can be used to reduce weight.
C. The effects of DNP can be reversed by administering
glucose. However, treatment with a combination of
glucose and 2-deoxyglucose, which is an inhibitor of
glycolysis, does not reverse the effects of DNP. Explain,
in terms of the products of glycolysis, why this reversal of
the effects of DNP was unexpected. (Hint: It might be
useful to review the reactants and products of glycolysis.)
D. Obesity correlates with an epidemic of other health
issues, such as elevated blood pressure, heart disease, and
diabetes II. A slow-release form of DNP (CRMP) is
patented. With slow-release technology, a drug can be
delivered in small doses over time from a pill whose
matrix limits solubility. A simple but nonscientific
question that can be raised is: Will a slow-release drug
retard progress toward behavioral changes that can reduce
the magnitude of this epidemic? Scientific questions can
be pursued by testing the outcomes predicted by possible
