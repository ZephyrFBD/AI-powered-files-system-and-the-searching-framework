cause of the
bottleneck (natural catastrophe, predation, or disease, for example), the small population that results becomes
severely vulnerable to genetic drift. Destructive geological or meteorological events such as floods, volcanic
eruptions, and ice ages have created bottlenecks for many populations of plants and animals.
5. Nonrandom mating occurs when individuals choose mates based upon their particular traits. For example, they
may always choose mates with traits similar to their own or traits different from their own. Nonrandom mating also
occurs when mates choose only nearby individuals. In all of these cases, mate selection is not random, and only the
alleles possessed by the mating individuals are passed to the next generation. The following two kinds of nonrandom
mating are commonly observed:
Inbreeding occurs when individuals mate with relatives.
Sexual selection occurs when females choose males based upon their attractive appearance or behavior or their
ability to defeat
