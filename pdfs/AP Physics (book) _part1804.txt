eld, must we use a positive
test charge, or would a negative one do as well? Explain.
15. Draw the electric field lines surrounding two negative
electric charges a distance apart.
16. Assume that the two opposite charges in Fig. 16–32a are
12.0 cm apart. Consider the magnitude of the electric field
2.5 cm from the positive charge. On which side of this
charge—top, bottom, left, or right—is the electric field the
strongest? The weakest? Explain.
17. Consider the electric field at the three points indicated by
the letters A, B, and C in Fig. 16–49. First draw an arrow 
at each point indicating the direction of the net force that 
a positive test charge would experience if placed at that
point, then list the letters in order of decreasing field
strength (strongest first). Explain.

10. The form of Coulomb’s law is very similar to that for
Newton’s law of universal gravitation. What are the differ-
ences between these two laws? Compare also gravitational
mass and
