d 
to understand his contribution, we need to examine the ways in which we can interpret 
entropy at the molecular level.
Expansion of a Gas at the Molecular Level
Consider a simple spontaneous process—the expansion of a gas into a vacuum as shown 
in Figure 19.5. Though we now understand that the entropy of the universe increases 
during the expansion, how can we explain the spontaneity of this process at the molec-
ular level? We can get a sense of what makes this expansion spontaneous by envision-
ing the gas as a collection of particles in constant motion, as we did in discussing the 
 
kinetic-molecular theory of gases. 
 (Section 10.7) When the stopcock in Figure 19.5 is 
opened, we can view the expansion of the gas as the ultimate result of the gas molecules 
moving randomly throughout the larger volume.
Let’s look at this idea more closely by tracking two of the gas molecules as they 
move around. Before the stopcock is opened, both molecules are confined to the left 
flask, as
