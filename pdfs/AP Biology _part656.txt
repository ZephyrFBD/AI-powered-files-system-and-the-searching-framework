o conserve water against the need to rid the body of poisons. The
kidney must adjust both the volume and the concentration of urine
depending on the animal’s intake of water and salt and the production of
urea. If fluid intake is high and salt intake is low, the kidney will produce
large volumes of dilute (hypoosmotic) urine. In periods of high salt
intake where water is unavailable, the kidney can produce concentrated
(hyperosmotic) urine.
The Nephron
The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron; see Figure 15.6. The
nephron consists of a cluster of capillaries called the glomerulus, which
sits inside a cuplike structure called Bowman’s capsule and connects to a
long narrow tube (the renal tubule). Each human kidney contains about 1
million nephrons. The nephron carries out its job in four steps: filtration,
secretion, reabsorption, and excretion.

Filtration is passive and nonselective.
Secretion is active and highly selective.
