All objects are at rest, so the tension 
in the 
connecting cord equals the weight w of the object:
We show the free-body diagram of the 
crown, and 
is what causes the scale reading (it is 
equal to the net downward force on the scale, by 
Newton’s third law). (b) Submerged, the crown has 
an additional force on it, the buoyant force 
The 
net force is zero, so

Buoyancy and Archimedes’ Principle
271
Archimedes’ principle applies equally well to objects that float, such as wood. In
general, an object floats on a fluid if its density
is less than that of the fluid
This is readily seen from Fig. 10–14a, where a submerged log of mass 
will
experience a net upward force and float to the surface if
