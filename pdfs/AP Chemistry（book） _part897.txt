 a pulse containing 5.0 * 1017 photons of this 
radiation, what is the total energy of that pulse? (c) If the 
laser emits 1.3 * 10 - 2 J of energy during a pulse, how many 
photons are emitted?
Solve The frequency, n, is calculated from the given wavelength, as 
shown in Sample Exercise 6.2:
n = 13.00 * 108 m>s2>1589 * 10-9 m2 = 5.09 * 1014 s - 1
The value of the Planck constant, h, is given both in the text and 
in the table of physical constants on the inside back cover of the 
text; thus we can easily calculate E:
E = 16.626 * 10 - 34 J@s215.09 * 1014 s - 12 = 3.37 * 10 - 19 J

6.3 ∣ Line Spectra and the Bohr Model
The work of Planck and Einstein paved the way for understanding how electrons are 
arranged in atoms. In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Figure 6.8) offered a theoret-
ical explanation of line spectra, another phenomenon that had puzzled scientists during 
the nineteenth century. We will see that Bohr used the
