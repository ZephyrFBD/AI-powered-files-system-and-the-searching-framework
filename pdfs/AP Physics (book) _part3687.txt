tly high, the Coulomb repulsion between the positive charges 
is not strong enough to keep all the hydrogen nuclei apart, and nuclear fusion can
take place.
In a star like our Sun, the fusion of hydrogen (sometimes referred to as
“burning”)† occurs via the proton–proton chain (Section 31–3, Eqs. 31–6), in which
four protons fuse to form a
nucleus with the release of 
rays, positrons,
and neutrinos:
These reactions require a tem-
perature of about 
corresponding to an average kinetic energy 
of
about 1 keV (Eq. 13–8). In more massive stars, the carbon cycle produces the
same net effect: four 
produce a
—see Section 31–3. The fusion reactions
take place primarily in the core of a star, where T may be on the order of 
to
(The surface temperature is much lower—on the order of a few thousand
kelvins.) The tremendous release of energy in these fusion reactions produces 
an outward pressure sufficient to halt the inward gravitational contraction. Our
protostar, now really a young star, stabil
