 5.59 Under constant-volume conditions, the heat of combustion 
of glucose 1C6H12O62 is 15.57 kJ>g. A 3.500-g sample of glu-
cose is burned in a bomb calorimeter. The temperature of 
the calorimeter increases from 20.94 to 24.72 °C. (a) What is 
 
the total heat capacity of the calorimeter? (b) If the size of the 
glucose sample had been exactly twice as large, what would 
the temperature change of the calorimeter have been?
 5.60 Under constant-volume conditions, the heat of combustion of 
benzoic acid 1C6H5COOH2 is 26.38 kJ>g. A 2.760-g sample of 
benzoic acid is burned in a bomb calorimeter. The temperature 
of the calorimeter increases from 21.60 to 29.93 °C. (a) What is 
the total heat capacity of the calorimeter? (b) A 1.440-g sample 
of a new organic substance is combusted in the same calorime-
ter. The temperature of the calorimeter increases from 22.14 to 
27.09 °C. What is the heat of combustion per gram of the
