cause it is so volatile. Which liquid would you 
expect to be used as a blowing agent?
 11.81  Use the normal boiling points
 
 propane 1C3H82  -42.1 °C
 
 butane 1C4H102  
-0.5 °C
 
 pentane  1C5H122  36.1 °C
 
 hexane 1C6H142  
68.7 °C
 
 heptane 1C7H162  
98.4 °C
 
 to estimate the normal boiling point of octane 1C8H182. 
Explain the trend in the boiling points.
 11.82  One of the attractive features of ionic liquids is their low 
 
vapor pressure, which in turn tends to make them 
nonﬂammable. Why do you think ionic liquids have lower 
vapor pressures than most room-temperature molecular  liq-
uids?
 11.83  (a) When you exercise vigorously, you sweat. How does this 
help your body cool? (b) A ﬂask of water is connected to a 
vacuum pump. A few moments after the pump is turned 
on, the water begins to boil. After a few minutes, the water 
begins to freeze. Explain why these processes occur.
 11.84  The following table gives the vapor pressure of hexaﬂuoro-
benzene 1C6F62 as a functi
