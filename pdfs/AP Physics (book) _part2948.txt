correct. The masses of the electron and the proton can be shown to be 
and 
respectively. For example, for the electron,

A 1-TeV proton. The Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab in
Illinois can accelerate protons to a kinetic energy of 1.0 TeV 
What is the
speed of such a proton?
APPROACH We solve the kinetic energy formula, Eq. 26–5a, for v.
SOLUTION The rest energy of a proton is 
or
Compared to the kinetic energy of 
the rest energy can be neglected, so
we simplify Eq. 26–5a to
We solve this for v in the following steps:
So the proton is traveling at a speed very nearly equal to c.
