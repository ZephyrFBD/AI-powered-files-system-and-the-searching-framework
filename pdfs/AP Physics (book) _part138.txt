e later time,
suppose the object 
has moved to position 
The displacement of our object is
and is
represented by the arrow pointing to the right in Fig. 2–5. It is convenient to write
where the symbol 
(Greek letter delta) means “change in.” Then 
means
“the change in x,” or “change in position,” which is the displacement. The change in
any quantity means the final value of that quantity, minus the initial value.
Suppose
and 
as in Fig. 2–5. Then
so the displacement is 20.0 m in the positive direction, Fig. 2–5.
Now consider an object moving to the left as shown in Fig. 2–6. Here the
object, a person, starts at
and walks to the left to the point
In this case her displacement is
and the blue arrow representing the vector displacement points to the left. For
one-dimensional motion along the x axis, a vector pointing to the right is 
positive, whereas a vector pointing to the left has a negative sign.
