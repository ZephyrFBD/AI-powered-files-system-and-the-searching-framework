e denote by 
) all goes into increasing the internal energy of the gas:
In the constant-pressure process, work is done. Hence the heat added,
must
not only increase the internal energy but also is used to do work 
Thus, to increase the temperature by the same 
more heat must be added in
the process at constant pressure than in the process at constant volume. For the
process at constant pressure, the first law of thermodynamics gives
Since 
is the same in the two processes (we chose 
to be the same), we can
combine the two above equations:
From the ideal gas law,
so for a process at constant pressure
Putting this into the last equation and using Eqs. D–1, we find
or, after cancellations,
(D;2)
Since the gas constant 
our prediction is
that 
will be larger than 
by about 
Indeed, this is very close
to what is obtained experimentally, as shown in the last column in Table D–1.
Now we calculate the molar specific heat of a monatomic gas using kinetic
theory. For a process carried out at con
