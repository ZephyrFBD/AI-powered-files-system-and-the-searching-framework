a-glucose molecules. It is the principal energy storage molecule in plant cells.
Glycogen is a polymer of a-glucose molecules. It differs from starch by its pattern of polymer branching. It is a
major energy storage molecule in animal cells.
Cellulose is a polymer of β-glucose molecules. It serves as a structural molecule in the walls of plant cells and is the
major component of wood.
Chitin is a polymer similar to cellulose, but each β-glucose molecule has a nitrogen-containing group attached to the
ring. Chitin serves as a structural molecule in the walls of fungus cells and in the exoskeletons of insects, other
arthropods, and mollusks.
The α-glucose in starch and the β-glucose in cellulose illustrate the dramatic chemical changes that can arise from
subtle molecular changes: The bonds in starch (specifically, the α-glycosidic linkages) can easily be broken down
(digested) by humans and other animals, but only specialized organisms, like the bacteria in the guts of termites, can
bre
