w ATP synthase works.
(c) Explain why ATP synthase would not be effective if it was found in the cytosol of a cell.
(d) Describe how the structure of the mitochondria allows for the formation of a proton gradient.
Long Free-Response
13. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as baker’s yeast) is a eukaryotic organism. A solution containing 5%
yeast and 10% glucose is placed in a transfer pipette. A weight is placed on the transfer pipette, and the
apparatus is placed in water in a large test tube, as shown in the following figure.
This process is repeated two more times, and each test tube is placed in a beaker of water at different
temperatures (5° Celsius, 20° Celsius, and 35° Celsius). To measure the amount of cellular respiration, the
cumulative number of bubbles of carbon dioxide released over a 10-minute period is recorded. The data are
shown in the following table.
(a) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
(b) On the axes provided, constr
