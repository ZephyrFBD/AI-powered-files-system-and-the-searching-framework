, and by how much?
(a) Fred, twice as much.
(b) Jane, twice as much.
(c) Fred, four times as much.
(d) Jane, four times as much.

amount.
4. Figure 16–50 shows electric field lines due to a point charge.
What can you say about the field at point 1 compared with
the field at point 2?
(a) The field at point 2 is larger, because point 2 is on a
field line.
(b) The field at point 1 is larger, because point 1 is not on
a field line.
(c) The field at point 1 is zero, because point 1 is not on a
field line.
(d) The field at point 1 is larger, because the field lines are
closer together in that region.
