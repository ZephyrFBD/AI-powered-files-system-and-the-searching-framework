 degrees 
due to light absorption. Measurements of the stratospheric ozone concentration 
showed significantly increased ozone decomposition in this 3-year period.
The Ozone Layer and Its Depletion
The ozone layer protects Earth’s surface from the damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation. 
Therefore, if the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere decreases substantially, more 
UV radiation will reach Earth’s surface, causing unwanted photochemical reactions, 
including reactions correlated with skin cancer. Satellite monitoring of ozone, which 
began in 1978, has revealed a depletion of ozone in the stratosphere that is particularly
