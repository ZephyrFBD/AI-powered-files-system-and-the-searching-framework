now the basic order of operations for mitosis.
Remember, the genome is all the DNA, or all the chromosomes, in a cell.
Stage 1: Prophase: Prep (the cell prepares to divide)
One of the first signs of prophase is the disappearance of the nucleolus (ribosome-making area) and the nuclear
envelope. In addition, the genome becomes visible as individual chromosomes; diffuse chromatin (which looks like
a pile of scrunched up dental floss in the nucleus) condenses into densely packed chromosomes. To accomplish this,
chromatin forms coils upon coils and thickens. If you look at a human cell under the light microscope at the
beginning of prophase, you would see 46 differently sized chromosomes, and each one would be the shape of an X.
During interphase, individual chromosomes are not visible.
Condensed chromosomes are easier to separate and move around the cell,
compared to diffuse chromatin.
Reminder: Plants usually donâ€™t have centrioles, but microtubules are still used
to pull the chromatids ap
