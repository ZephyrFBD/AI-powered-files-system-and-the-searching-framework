Consider the following questions before you proceed to the next experiment: 
•  You measured the color change at different times. Which time will you use for your 
later assays? Why? (The time/color change that you select will serve as your baseline 
for additional investigations.) 
•  When you use this assay to assess factors that change enzyme activity, which  
components of the assay will you change? Which will you keep constant?

■ Procedure 2: Determining the Effect of pH on Enzymatic 
Activity 
Numerous variables can be employed to observe the effects on the rate of an enzymatic 
reaction and possibly the specific fit of the enzyme with the substrate. 
•  What do you predict will occur if the pH in the reaction changes? How do you justify 
your prediction?
