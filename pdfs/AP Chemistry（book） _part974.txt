 which has a stable configu-
ration with eight electrons (an octet) in the outermost occupied shell. The next element, 
sodium, atomic number 11, marks the beginning of a new row of the periodic table. 
Sodium has a single 3s electron beyond the stable configuration of neon. We can there-
fore abbreviate the electron configuration of sodium as
Na: 3Ne43s1
The symbol 3Ne4 represents the electron configuration of the ten electrons of neon, 1s22s22p6. 
Writing the electron configuration as 3Ne43s1 focuses attention on the outermost electron of 
the atom, which is the one largely responsible for how sodium behaves chemically.
We can generalize what we have just done for the electron configuration of sodium. 
In writing the condensed electron configuration of an element, the electron configuration 
of the nearest noble-gas element of lower atomic number is represented by its chemical 
symbol in brackets. For lithium, for example, we can write
Li: 3He42s1
We refer to the electrons represente
