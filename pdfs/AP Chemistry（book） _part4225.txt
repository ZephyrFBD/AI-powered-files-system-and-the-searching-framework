rochlo-
ric acid is a strong acid. Figure 17.11 The pH at the equivalence 
point increases (becomes more basic) as the acid becomes weaker. 
The volume of added base needed to reach the equivalence point 
remains unchanged. Figure 17.12 No; it would change color by 
pH 6 and miss pH 7. Figure 17.15 H2PO3
- at first equivalence 
point, HPO3
2- at the second. Figure 17.22 Because the solution is 
basic. Figure 17.23 Yes. CuS would precipitate in step 2 on addi-
tion of H2S to an acidic solution, while the Zn2 +  ions remained in 
solution.

Figure 18.1 About 85 km, at the mesopause. Figure 18.3  
The atmosphere absorbs a significant fraction of solar radiation.  
Figure 18.4 (c) UV Figure 18.5 The peak value is about 
5 * 1012 molecules per cm3. If we use Avogradro’s number 
to convert molecules to moles, and the conversion factor of 
1000 cm3 = 1000 mL = 1 L, we find that the concentration of 
ozone at the peak is 8 * 10-9 mole>L. Figure 18.8 The major
