 atoms in a molecule. (Section 9.1)
bond dipole The dipole moment that is due only to unequal 
electron sharing between two atoms in a covalent bond. 
(Section 9.3)
bond enthalpy The enthalpy change, ∆H, required to break 
a particular bond when the substance is in the gas phase.

GLOSSARY 
G-3
bonding atomic radius The radius of an atom as defined by 
the distances separating it from other atoms to which it is 
chemically bonded. (Section 7.3)
bonding molecular orbital A molecular orbital in which the 
electron density is concentrated in the internuclear region. The 
energy of a bonding molecular orbital is lower than the energy 
of the separate atomic orbitals from which it forms. (Section 9.7)
bonding pair In a Lewis structure, a pair of electrons that is 
shared by two atoms. (Section 8.3)
bond length The distance between the centers of two bonded 
atoms. (Section 8.3)
bond order The number of bonding electron pairs shared 
between two atoms, minus the number of ant
