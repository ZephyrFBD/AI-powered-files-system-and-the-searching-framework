divide at all. In every case, however, the entire process is tightly regulated
by a complex mechanism involving kinases and allosteric interactions. If
something goes awry, the result can be uncontrolled cell division
characteristic of cancer.
Two important factors limit cell size and promote cell division: the
ratio of the volume of a cell to its surface area and the capacity of the
nucleus to control the entire cell.
Ratio of the Cell Volume to Surface Area
As a cell grows, the surface area of the cell membrane increases as the
square of the radius, while the volume of the cell increases as the cube of
the radius. (The formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr2, and the
formula for the volume of a sphere is 43⁢π⁢r3.) Therefore, as a cell
grows larger, the volume inside the cell increases at a faster rate than the
cell membrane increases.
