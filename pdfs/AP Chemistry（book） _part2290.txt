e active site of 
the enzyme. The FeMo-cofactor of nitrogenase is 
a cluster of seven Fe atoms and one Mo atom, all 
linked by sulfur atoms (Figure 14.29).
It is one of the wonders of life that simple 
bacteria can contain beautifully complex and 
vitally important enzymes such as nitrogenase. 
Because of this enzyme, nitrogen is continually 
cycled between its comparatively inert role in the 
atmosphere and its critical role in living organ-
isms. Without nitrogenase, life as we know it 
could not exist on Earth.
