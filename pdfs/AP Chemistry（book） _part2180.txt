  >L = 1.00 M. After 20 s, the concentration of A has fallen to 
0.54 M and the concentration of B has risen to 0.46 M. The sum of the concentrations is 
still 1.00 M because 1 mol of B is produced for each mole of A that reacts. After 40 s, the 
concentration of A is 0.30 M and that of B is 0.70 M.
The rate of this reaction can be expressed either as the rate of disappearance of reac-
tant A or as the rate of appearance of product B. The average rate of appearance of B over 
a particular time interval is given by the change in concentration of B divided by the 
change in time:
 
 Average rate of appearance of B =

We use brackets around a chemical formula, as in [B], to indicate molarity. The 
Greek letter delta, ∆, is read “change in” and is always equal to a final value minus an 
initial value.
