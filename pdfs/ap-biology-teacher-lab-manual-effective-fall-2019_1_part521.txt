med cells onto one plate, then spin down and plate 
the remaining 90 percent of cells onto a second plate. If transformation efficiency is 
low, and only a few cells take up DNA, this extra plate with more bacteria may have a 
few transformants. This extra step is helpful in demonstrating the effects of dilution on 
plating efficiency, too. 
Despite all efforts, sometimes transformation is unsuccessful. If this happens, one 
suggestion is to use a random number generator to come up with imaginary colony 
counts for the purpose of working through the transformation efficiency calculations. 
The last area of challenge for students is spreading transformants and controls 
to the agar plates. Delivering an excess of transformed culture to the plates is 
counterproductive because the plates may not absorb the additional liquid and spreading 
will be uneven. Transferring bacterial suspensions from the microtubes is tricky; 
the bacteria will settle at the bottom, but students can hold the to
