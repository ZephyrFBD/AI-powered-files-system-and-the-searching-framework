 Of the individuals with a “?”, identify which of them is heterozygous.
(d) It is possible for a mother to pass on either of her two copies of a gene. Explain why this is helpful to
prepare populations for selective pressures.
6. Regulation of genes prior to transcription is essential. The covalent modification of methylation is one such
way that gene control occurs in eukaryotes, and it has been implicated in several diseases. DNA methylation
turns off eukaryotic gene expression by physically blocking transcriptional proteins and by recruiting
chromatin remodeling proteins that change the packing of DNA around histones.
An experiment was performed to assess the relative amount of transcription and the impact of a sequence-
specific regulatory factor and the amount that DNA is packaged. The results are shown in Table 1.
