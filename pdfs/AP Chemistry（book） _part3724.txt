Why are compounds of Ti(IV) colorless?
The magnitude of the crystal-field splitting energy and, consequently, the color 
of a complex depend on both the metal and the ligands. For example, we saw in Fig-
ure 23.4 that the color of 3M(H2O)642+ complexes changes from reddish-pink when the 
metal ion is Co2+, to green for Ni2+, to pale blue for Cu2+. If we change the ligands in 
the 3Ni(H2O)642+ ion, the color also changes. 3Ni(NH3)642+ has a blue-violet color, while 
3Ni(en)342+ is purple (Figure 23.30). In a ranking called the spectrochemical series, 
ligands are arranged in order of their abilities to increase the crystal-field splitting energy, 
as in this abbreviated list:
::Increasing ∆¡
Cl- 6 F- 6 H2O 6 NH3 6 en 6 NO2
-1N@bonded2 6 CN-
The magnitude of ∆ increases by roughly a factor of 2 from the far left to the far right 
of the spectrochemical series. Ligan
