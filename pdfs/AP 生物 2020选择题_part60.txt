1. Scientists studying transcription in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) created an experimental strain that 
produced a modified RNA polymerase containing a single amino acid substitution. The scientists determined 
the maximum elongation rate during transcription with and without the modified RNA polymerase enzyme 
(Figure 1). 
The compound amanitin, which is commonly found in toxic mushrooms, is a specific RNA polymerase 
inhibitor. Amanitin binds to the RNA polymerase active site and inhibits transcription. In a second 
experiment, the scientists treated the wild-type and experimental strains of S. cerevisiae with a 40 μg / mL 
solution of amanitin and recorded the maximum elongation rate of the mRNA (Figure 2). Error bars represent 
±2SEx.
