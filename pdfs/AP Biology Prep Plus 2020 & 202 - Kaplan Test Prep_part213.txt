acteria that are aﬀected by ampicillin.
Aȇer applying the treatment, you can test for transformation by looking
for bacterial growth on a medium that contains ampicillin. You start with
a stock of ampicillin-sensitive bacteria and a stock of plasmids containing
the gene for ampicillin resistance. You apply the shock treatment to the
bacteria and add the plasmids, then apply the bacteria to growth media
with and without ampicillin. Only bacteria that have incorporated the
ampicillin-resistant gene from the plasmid into their genome will survive
in the medium containing ampicillin. Your goal in this part of the
laboratory is to see firsthand the products of recombination and
transformation that you have already learned on paper.
