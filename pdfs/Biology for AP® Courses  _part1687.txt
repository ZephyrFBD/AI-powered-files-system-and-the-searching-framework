ion proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each
single-codon “step” of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by
three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes
GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group
of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase,
an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is

derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA
is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain
