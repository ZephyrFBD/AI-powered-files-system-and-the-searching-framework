stion that Ellis-Van Creveld
syndrome leads to decreased survival, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because it would be
extremely unlikely that random mutations over several generations would lead to the appearance of the allele
that causes Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome.
5. (D) Initially, the population of wild prairie dogs did not possess the A1 allele, so it is likely that it arrived in an
individual prairie dog that migrated into the population sometime between years 2 and 3. Therefore, gene flow
is the correct answer. Choice (A) is incorrect because these are wild prairie dogs, and there is no evidence of
selective breeding of prairie dogs by humans. No information is given in the question about whether or not
alleles A1 or A2 confer a survival advantage, so choice (B) is incorrect. No allele was lost in the population, so
choice (C) is incorrect.
6. (B) If individuals with the Aa genotype are more likely to survive and reproduce (heterozygote advantage), the
