its for the stiffness test are psi * 10-3 1psi = pounds per square 
inch2; those for the yield stress test are psi. Discussion of the exact meaning and significance 
of these tests is beyond the scope of this text.
Polymers can be made stiffer by introducing chemical bonds between chains. Form-
ing bonds between chains is called cross-linking (Figure 12.41). The greater the number 
of cross-links, the more rigid the polymer. Whereas thermoplastic materials consist of 
independent polymer chains, thermosetting plastics become cross-linked when heated; 
the cross-links allow them to hold their shapes.
An important example of cross-linking is the vulcanization of natural rubber, a 
process discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839. Natural rubber is formed from a liquid 
resin derived from the inner bark of the Hevea brasiliensis tree. Chemically, it is a polymer 
of isoprene, C5H8 (Figure 12.42). Because rotation about the carbonâ€“carbon double bond 
does not readily occur, the orientation o
