 radiation emanating from the sample 
decays as well. For example, the half-life of cobalt-60 is 5.27 yr. The 4.0-mCi sample of 
cobalt-60 would, after 5.27 yr, have a radiation activity of 2.0 mCi, or 7.5 * 107 Bq.
Give It Some Thought
If the size of a radioactive sample is doubled, what happens to the activity of the 
sample in Bq?
Because radioactive decay is a first-order kinetic process, its rate is proportional to 
the number of radioactive nuclei N in a sample:
 
Rate = kN 
[21.18]
The first-order rate constant, k, is called the decay constant and is related to the half-life:
 
k = 0.693
t1>2
 
[21.19]
Thus, if we know the value of either the half-life or the decay constant, we can calculate 
the value of the other.
As we saw in Section 14.4, a first-order rate law can be expressed in the following form:
 
ln Nt
N0
= -kt 
[21.20]
In this equation t is the time interval of decay, k is the decay constant, N0 is the initial 
number of nuclei (at time zero), and Nt is the number rem
