a part). So the dashed line CB is equal to r, the radius of curvature, and CB is
normal to the mirror’s surface at B. The incoming ray that hits the mirror at B
makes an angle with this normal, and hence the reflected ray, BF, also makes an
angle 
with the normal (law of reflection). The angle BCF is also , as shown.
The triangle CBF is isosceles because two of its angles are equal. Thus length
We assume the mirror surface is small compared to the mirror’s radius
of curvature, so the angles are small, and the length FB is nearly equal to 
length FA. In this approximation,
But
the focal length,
and
Thus the focal length is half the radius of curvature:
[spherical mirror] (23;1)
We assumed only that the angle 
was small, so this result applies for all other
incident paraxial rays. Thus all paraxial rays pass through the same point F, the
focal point.
Since it is only approximately true that the rays come to a perfect focus at F,
the more curved the mirror, the worse the approxi
