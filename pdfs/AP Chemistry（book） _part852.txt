CHAPTER 5 Thermochemistry
 5.87 Consider the reaction 2 H21g2 +  O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2. 
(a) Use the bond enthalpies in Table 5.4 to estimate ∆H for 
this reaction, ignoring the fact that water is in the liquid 
state. (b) Without doing a calculation, predict whether your 
estimate in part (a) is more negative or less negative than the 
true reaction enthalpy. (c) Use the enthalpies of formation 
in Appendix C to determine the true reaction enthalpy.
 5.88 Consider the reaction H21g2 + I21s2 ¡ 2 HI1g2. (a) Use the 
bond enthalpies in Table 5.4 to estimate ∆H for this reaction, 
ignoring the fact that iodine is in the solid state. (b) Without 
doing a calculation, predict whether your estimate in part (a) 
is more negative or less negative than the true reaction en-
thalpy. (c) Use the enthalpies of formation in Appendix C to 
determine the true reaction enthalpy.
