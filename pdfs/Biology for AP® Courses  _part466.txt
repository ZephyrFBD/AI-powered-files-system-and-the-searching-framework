Think About It
A certain cell type functions primarily to synthesize proteins for export. What is the most likely route the newly made
protein takes through the cell? Justify your prediction.
Section Summary
The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, the ER, and Golgi apparatus, as well as the
plasma membrane. These cellular components work together to modify, package, tag, and transport proteins and lipids that
form the membranes.
The RER modifies proteins and synthesizes phospholipids used in cell membranes. The SER synthesizes carbohydrates,
lipids, and steroid hormones; engages in the detoxification of medications and poisons; and stores calcium ions. Sorting,
tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes are created by the
budding of the membranes of the RER and Golgi. Lysosomes digest macromolecules, recycle worn-out organelles, and
destroy pathoge
