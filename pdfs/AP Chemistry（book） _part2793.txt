ss of 2.9 * 10-2 M causes 
PbCl2 to precipitate.
Comparing the Cl-1aq2 concentration required to precipitate 
each salt, we see that as Cl-1aq2 is added, AgCl precipitates 
first because it requires a much smaller concentration of Cl-. 
Thus, Ag+1aq2 can be separated from Pb2 +1aq2 by slowly adding 
Cl-1aq2 so that the chloride ion concentration remains between 
1.8 * 10-8 M and 2.9 * 10-2 M.
Comment Precipitation of AgCl will keep the Cl-1aq2 concentra-
tion low until the number of moles of Cl-1aq2 added exceeds the 
number of moles of Ag+1aq2 in the solution. Once past this point, 
3Cl-4 rises sharply and PbCl2 will soon begin to precipitate.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Under what conditions does an ionic compound precipitate 
from a solution of the constituent ions?
(a) always (b) when Q = Ksp (c) when Q exceeds Ksp (d) when Q 
is less than Ksp (e) never, if it is very soluble
