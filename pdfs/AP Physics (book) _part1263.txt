6. A highway overpass was observed to resonate as one full
loop 
when a small earthquake shook the ground verti-
cally at 3.0 Hz. The highway department put a support at
the center of the overpass, anchoring it to the ground as
shown in Fig. 11–62. What resonant frequency would you
now expect for the overpass? It is noted that earthquakes
rarely do significant shaking above 5 or 6 Hz. Did the
modifications do any good? Explain. (See Section 11–3.)
