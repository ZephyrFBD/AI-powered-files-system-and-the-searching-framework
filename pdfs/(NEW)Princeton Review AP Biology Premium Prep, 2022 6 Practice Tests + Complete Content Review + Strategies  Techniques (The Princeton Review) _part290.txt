eeding on different strains of pea plants. Mendel
worked exclusively with true-breeder pea plants. This means the plants he used were genetically pure and
consistently produced the same traits. For example, tall plants always produced tall plants; short plants always
produced short plants. Through his work, he came up with three principles of genetics: the Law of Dominance, the
Law of Segregation, and the Law of Independent Assortment.
The Law of Dominance
Mendel crossed two true-breeding plants with contrasting traits: tall pea plants and short pea plants.
To his surprise, when Mendel mated these plants, the characteristics didnâ€™t blend to produce plants of average
height. Instead, all the offspring were tall.
Mendel recognized that one trait must be masking the effect of the other trait. This is called the Law of Dominance.
The dominant tall allele, T, somehow masked the presence of the recessive short allele, t. Consequently, all a plant
needs is one tall allele to make it tall.
