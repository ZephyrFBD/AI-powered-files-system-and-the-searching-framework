ps out of your “carry-on”bag, you notice
it has noticeably “puffed up.”Airplane cabins are typically
pressurized at 0.75 atm, and assuming the temperature
inside an airplane is about the same as inside a potato chip
processing plant, by what percentage has the bag “puffed
up” in comparison to when it was packaged?
34. (II) A helium-filled balloon escapes a child’s hand at sea
level and 20.0°C. When it reaches an altitude of 3600 m,
where the temperature is 5.0°C and the pressure only
0.68 atm, how will its volume compare to that at sea level?
35. (II) Compare the value for the density of water vapor at
exactly 100°C and 1 atm (Table 10–1) with the value predicted
from the ideal gas law. Why would you expect a difference?
36. (III) A sealed test tube traps 
of air at a pressure of
1.00 atm and temperature of 18°C. The test tube’s stopper
has a diameter of 1.50 cm and will “pop off” the test tube 
if a net upward force of 10.0 N is applied to it. To what
temperature would you have to hea
