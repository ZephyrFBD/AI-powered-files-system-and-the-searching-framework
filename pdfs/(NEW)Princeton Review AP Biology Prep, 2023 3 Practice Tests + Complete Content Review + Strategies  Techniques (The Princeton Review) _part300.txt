ze Mendel’s three laws.
SUMMARY OF MENDEL’S LAWS
Laws
Definition
Law of Dominance
One trait masks the effects of another trait.
Law of Segregation
Each gamete gets only one of the copies of each gene.
Law of Independent Assortment
Each pair of homologous chromosomes splits independently,
so the alleles of different genes can mix and match.
Test Cross
Suppose we want to know if a tall plant is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). Its physical appearance doesn’t
necessarily tell us about its genetic makeup. The only way to determine its genotype is to cross the plant with a
recessive, short plant, tt. This is known as a test cross. When the recessive plant is used, there will be only two
possible outcomes in the daughter plants. Our mystery tall plant could be TT or Tt so when we mate it to a short
plant, these are the possible situations: (1) TT × tt or (2) Tt × tt. Let’s take a look.
If none of the offspring is short, our original plant must have been homozygous, TT. If, however, even
