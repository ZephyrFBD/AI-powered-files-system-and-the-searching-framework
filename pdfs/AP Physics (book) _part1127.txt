output piston is 18 cm, and the
input force is 380 N. (a) What is the area of the input
piston? (b) What is the work done in lifting the car 42 cm?
(c) If the input piston moves 13 cm in each stroke, how
high does the car move up for each stroke? (d) How many
strokes are required to jack the car up 42 cm? (e) Show
that energy is conserved.
78. When you ascend or descend a great deal when driving in 
a car, your ears “pop,” which means that the pressure
behind the eardrum is being equalized to that outside. If
this did not happen, what would be the approximate force
on an eardrum of area 
if a change in altitude of
1250 m takes place?
79. Giraffes are a wonder of cardiovascular engineering. Cal-
culate the difference in pressure (in atmospheres) that the
blood vessels in a giraffe’s head must accommodate as the
head is lowered from a full upright position to ground level
for a drink. The height of an average giraffe is about 6 m.
