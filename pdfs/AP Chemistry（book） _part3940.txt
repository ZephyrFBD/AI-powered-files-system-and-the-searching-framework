106
(read “one point two multi ten to the sixth power”)
0.000604 is 6.04 * 10-4
(read “six point zero four times ten to the negative fourth 
power”)
A positive exponent, as in the first example, tells us how many times a number must 
be multiplied by 10 to give the long form of the number:
 1.2 * 106 = 1.2 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 1six tens2
 = 1,200,000
It is also convenient to think of the positive exponent as the number of places the decimal 
point must be moved to the left to obtain a number greater than 1 and less than 10. For 
example, if we begin with 3450 and move the decimal point three places to the left, we 
end up with 3.45 * 103.
In a related fashion, a negative exponent tells us how many times we must divide a 
number by 10 to give the long form of the number.
6.04 * 10-4 =
6.04
10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 0.000604
It is convenient to think of the negative exponent as the number of places the decimal 
point must be moved to the right to obtain a number greater than 1 but les
