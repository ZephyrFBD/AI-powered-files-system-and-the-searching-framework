to 5 m or more. A flute acts as an open tube, for it is open not only where you blow
into it, but is open also at the opposite end. The different notes on a flute are
obtained by shortening the length of the vibrating air column, by uncovering holes
along the tube (so a displacement antinode can occur at the hole). The shorter
the length of the vibrating air column, the higher the fundamental frequency.

FIGURE 12–13 Example 12–12.
Flute. A flute is designed to play middle C (262 Hz) as the
fundamental frequency when all the holes are covered. Approximately how long
should the distance be from the mouthpiece to the far end of the flute? (This is
only approximate since the antinode does not occur precisely at the mouthpiece.)
Assume the temperature is 20°C.
