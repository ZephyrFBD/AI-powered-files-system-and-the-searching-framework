3.12 Polar Function Graphs 
3.12.1 Graphs of Polar Equations 
The graph of a polar equation r = f () consists of all points P that have at least one polar 
representation (r, ) whose coordinates satisfy the equation.  
Many curves that arise in mathematics and its applications are more easily and naturally 
represented by polar equations than by rectangular equations. 
A rectangular grid is helpful for plotting points in rectangular coordinates. To plot points in 
polar coordinates, it is con
