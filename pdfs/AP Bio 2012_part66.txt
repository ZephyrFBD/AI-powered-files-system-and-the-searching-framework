63. The Hedgehog protein (Hh) plays a critical role during a certain period of embryo development, but it normally 
has no role in adults except for the maintenance of adult stem cells. However, the Hedgehog protein has been 
detected in 70 percent of pancreatic cancer cell samples. As illustrated in the figures below, the Hedgehog 
protein binds to an integral membrane protein receptor known as Patched (Ptc), thus initiating a pathway of gene 
expression. When Hedgehog is absent, Ptc inhibits another protein known as Smoothened (Smo), which, in turn, 
blocks the activation of a group of proteins collectively known as the Hedgehog signaling complex (HSC). The 
inactivation is the result of proteolytic cleavage of one component of the HSC complex, a transcr
