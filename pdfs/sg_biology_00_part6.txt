What detects the change in the variable?                                                                                                                                         1 pt
Structure-sensor (cell, tissue, organ, gland) and must have indication of detection
           e.g., senses, detects, picks up, feels, recognizes,monitors, contains or holds receptors
What corrects an INCREASE in the variable?                                                                                                                               1 pt
