age to the growth-regulation mechanism of cells, inducing the cells to reproduce uncon-
trollably. Leukemia, which is characterized by excessive growth of white blood cells, is 
probably the major type of radiation-caused cancer.
In light of the biological effects of radiation, it is important to determine whether 
any levels of exposure are safe. Unfortunately, we are hampered in our attempts to set real-
istic standards because we do not fully understand the effects of long-term exposure. Sci-
entists concerned with setting health standards have used the hypothesis that the effects 
of radiation are proportional to exposure. Any amount of radiation is assumed to cause 
some finite risk of injury, and the effects of high dosage rates are extrapolated to those of 
lower ones. Other scientists believe, however, that there is a threshold below which there 
are no radiation risks. Until scientific evidence enables us to settle the matter with some 
confidence, it is safer to assume tha
