se levels become 
elevated, stimulating beta cells of the 
pancreas to release insulin into the blood. 
Excess glucose is then converted to 
glycogen in the liver, reducing blood 
glucose levels. 
(C) At high elevation, atmospheric oxygen is 
more scarce. In response to signals that 
oxygen is low, the brain decreases an 
individualâ€™s rate of respiration to 
compensate for the difference. 
(D) A transcription factor binds to the regulatory 
region of a gene, blocking the binding of 
another transcription factor required for 
expression.

32. Five new species of bacteria were discovered in 
Antarctic ice core samples. The nucleotide (base) 
sequences of rRNA subunits were determined for 
the new species. The table below shows the 
number of nucleotide differences between the 
species.
