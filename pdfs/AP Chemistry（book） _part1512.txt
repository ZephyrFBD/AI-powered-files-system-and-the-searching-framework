 (a) What are the approximate bond angles about each of the 
two carbon atoms, and what are the hybridizations of the or-
bitals on each of them? (b) What are the hybridizations of 
the orbitals on the two oxygens and the nitrogen atom, and 
what are the approximate bond angles at the nitrogen? (c) 
What is the total number of s bonds in the entire molecule, 
and what is the total number of p bonds?
