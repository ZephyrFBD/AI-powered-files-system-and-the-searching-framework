Tonicity describes the eﬀect of a solution on a cell and is related to
osmolarity, which is the total concentration of all solutes in the solution.
The table describes the osmolarity of extracellular and intracellular fluids
of cells in hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic solutions. Depending on
the tonicity, a plant cell may be turgid, flaccid, or plasmolyzed (Figure 1).
