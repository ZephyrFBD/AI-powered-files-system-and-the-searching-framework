n a shorter, less functional procollagen protein.
(d) If an exon was deleted, the resulting mRNA transcript would not contain the complete code for the protein.
So the translated protein would be shorter and likely less functional.
12. (a) The promoter serves as a binding site for RNA polymerase at which transcription begins.
(b) All living organisms use RNA polymerase, an enzyme that has a consistent three-dimensional shape. All
living organisms need similar nucleotide sequences in their promoters that RNA polymerase can recognize.
(c)
(Note that any “X” to the left of the gene is acceptable.)
(d) The deletion of the TATA box in the promoter would most likely make it more difficult for RNA
polymerase to recognize the promoter. Less transcription would occur, and less protein would be produced.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) POLR2A was used as the control because the expression of all the other genes was compared to the
expression of POLR2A.
(b) POLR2A would be the best gene to use as a co
