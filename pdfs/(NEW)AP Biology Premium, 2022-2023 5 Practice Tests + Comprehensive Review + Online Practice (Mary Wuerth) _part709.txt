bers by a semipermeable membrane, as shown in the figure.
Water and iodine molecules can pass through the membrane, and starch molecules cannot pass through the
membrane. Starch molecules are stained a dark blue or black color when in direct contact with iodine.
One hundred milliliters of an aqueous iodine solution are placed in the chamber on the left side of the U-tube
apparatus (side A). One hundred milliliters of a 5% starch solution are placed in the chamber on the right side
of the U-tube apparatus (side B). Which of the following is the most likely result after allowing the liquids to
equilibrate for six hours?
(A) The water level on side A will rise, and side A will turn dark blue when the iodine and starch interact.
(B) The water level on side A will rise, and side B will turn dark blue when the iodine and starch interact.
(C) The water level on side B will rise, and side A will turn dark blue when the iodine and starch interact.
(D) The water level on side B will rise, and si
