y worker exposed to a 40-mCi 
source, assuming the 
person’s body has cross-sectional area 
and is normally about 4.0 m from
the source for 4.0 h per day?
emits rays of energy 1.33 MeV and 1.17 MeV 
in quick succession. Approximately 50% of the 
rays interact in the body and
deposit all their energy. (The rest pass through.)
APPROACH Of the given energy emitted, only a fraction passes through the
worker, equal to her area divided by the total area 
over a full sphere of
radius
4.0 m (Fig. 31–16).
SOLUTION The total -ray energy per decay is 
so the total energy emitted by the source per second is
The proportion of this energy intercepted by the body is its 
area divided
by the area of a sphere of radius 4.0 m (Fig. 31–16):
So the rate energy is deposited in the body (remembering that only 50% of the 
rays interact in the body) is
Since 
the whole-body dose rate for this 70-kg person is
In 4.0 h, this amounts to a dose of
for gammas, so the effective dose is 
(Eqs. 31–10b and 31–9)
