ll without slipping and the tire is
in firm contact with the ground. The speed of the bike v and the angular velocity
of the wheels 
are related by 
The bike slows down uniformly, so the
angular acceleration is constant and we can use Eqs. 8–9.
SOLUTION (a) The initial angular velocity of the wheel, whose radius is 34.0 cm, is
(b) In coming to a stop, the bike passes over 115 m of ground. The circumference
of the wheel is 
so each revolution of the wheel corresponds to a distance
traveled of 
Thus the number of revolutions the wheel
makes in coming to a stop is
(c) The angular acceleration of the wheel can be obtained from Eq. 8–9c, for
which we set 
and 
Because each revolution corresponds
to 
radians of angle, then 
and
(d) Equation 8–9a or b allows us to solve for the time. The first is easier:
NOTE When the bike tire completes one revolution, the bike advances linearly
a distance equal to the outer circumference 
of the tire, as long as there is
no slipping or sliding.
