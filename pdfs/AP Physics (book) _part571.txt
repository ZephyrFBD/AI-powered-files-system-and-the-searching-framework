dealing with systems of many objects, in which a detailed consideration of the
forces involved would be difficult or impossible. These laws apply to a wide 
range of phenomena. They even apply in the atomic and subatomic worlds, where
Newton’s laws are not sufficient.
This Chapter is devoted to the very important concept of energy and the
closely related concept of work. These two quantities are scalars and so have no
direction associated with them, which often makes them easier to work with than
vector quantities such as acceleration and force.

The word work has a variety of meanings in everyday language. But in physics,
work is given a very specific meaning to describe what is accomplished when a
force acts on an object, and the object moves th
