16.119 (a) To the precision of the reported data, the pH of rainwa-
ter 40 years ago was 5.4, no different from the pH today. With extra 
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, 3H+4 = 3.61 * 10-6 M, pH = 5.443 (b) A 20.0-L 
bucket of today’s rainwater contains 0.02 L (with extra signiﬁcant 
ﬁgures, 0.0200 L) of dissolved CO2. 16.123 Rx 1, ∆H = 104 kJ;  
Rx 2, ∆H = -32 kJ.  Reaction 2 is exothermic while reaction 1 
is endothermic. For binary acids with heavy atoms (X) in the 
same family, the longer and weaker the H—X bond, the stron-
ger the acid (and the more exothermic the ionization reaction).  
16.126 (a) K(i) = 5.6 * 103, K(ii) = 10 (b) Both (i) and (ii) have 
K 7 1, so both could be written with a single arrow.

17.1 The middle box has the highest pH. For equal amounts of acid 
HX, the greater the amount of conjugate base X -, the smaller the 
amount of H+ and t
