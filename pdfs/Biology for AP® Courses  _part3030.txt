26.5: Nervous System Disorders
Introduction
While you’re reading this book, your nervous system is performing several functions simultaneously. The visual system
is processing what is seen on the page, the motor system controls the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse), and the
prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are
controlled by the nervous system. A nervous system is an organism’s control center: it processes sensory information from
outside (and inside) the body and controls all behaviors—from eating to sleeping to finding a mate.
Scientists have even discovered that certain individual neurons (a type of nerve cell) can multitask. Neuroscientists often
use the model organism C. elegans (a worm) to study neurons. While studying these worms, it was recently discovered
that one type of neuron called AIY regulates both speed and direction of movement. Even though humans have billions of
