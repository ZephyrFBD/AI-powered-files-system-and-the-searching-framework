 In aquatic environments, water conveys sperm to egg (as in fish and amphibians), but in most terrestrial
animals (such as reptiles, birds, and mammals), fertilization occurs internally. The adaptation of the shelled (amniote) egg
with extraembryonic membranes in reptiles and birds allowed offspring to develop in the conditions associated with land,
particularly the lack of water. Placental mammals, including humans, retain the embryo in the female’s body until birth.

External Fertilization
External fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water. After
the sperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place. Most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning
where one or several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time. The
