74. A ball is shot from the top of a building with an initial
velocity of 
at an angle
above the horizontal.
(a) What are the horizontal and vertical components of the
initial velocity? (b) If a nearby building is the same height
and 55 m away, how far below the top of the building will
the ball strike the nearby building?
75. If a baseball pitch leaves the pitcher’s hand horizontally at
a velocity of 
by what % will the pull of gravity
change the magnitude of the velocity when the ball reaches
the batter, 18 m away? For this estimate, ignore air resis-
tance and spin on the ball.

1. Here is something to try at a sporting event. Show that
the maximum height h attained by an object projected
into the air, such as a baseball, football, or soccer ball, is
approximately given by
where 
is the total time of flight for the object in sec-
onds. Assume that the object returns to the same level
as that from which it
