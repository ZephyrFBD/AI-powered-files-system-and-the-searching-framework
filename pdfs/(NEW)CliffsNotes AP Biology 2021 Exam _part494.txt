sure to the red light in
sunlight. Some far-red light is also present in sunlight, so some of the Pfr is converted back into Pr.
4. Pr accumulates at night. At night, the levels of Pfr drop. This is because there is no sunlight to make the
conversion from Pr to Pfr and Pfr breaks down faster than Pr. Furthermore, the cell continues to make Pr at night.
5. At daybreak, light rapidly converts the accumulated Pr to Pfr.
6. Night length is responsible for resetting the circadian-rhythm clock. If daylight is interrupted with a brief dark
period, there is no effect on the circadian-rhythm clock. In contrast, flashes of red or farred light during the night
period can reset the clock. If a plant is exposed
to a flash of red light during the night, Pr is converted back to Pfr, a
shorter night period is measured, and the circadian rhythm is reset. If a flash of far-red light follows the red light,
then the effect of the red light is reversed, and the night length is restored to the night length
