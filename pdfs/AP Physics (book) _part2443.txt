leted. Charge
starts building up, and fields form just as in Fig. 22–4b. The 
and 
signs in
Fig. 22–5a indicate the net charge on each rod at a given instant. The black arrows
indicate the direction of the current. The electric field is represented by red lines
in the plane of the page; and the magnetic field, according to the right-hand rule,
is into 
or out of 
the page in blue. In Fig. 22–5b, the voltage of the ac 
generator has reversed in direction; the current is reversed and the new magnetic
field is in the opposite direction. Because the new fields have changed direction,
the old lines fold back to connect up to some of the new lines and form closed
loops as shown.† The old fields, however, don’t suddenly disappear; they are on
their way to distant points. Indeed, because a changing magnetic field produces
an electric field, and a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, this 
combination of changing electric and magnetic fields moving outward is self-
supporting, no
