f formation of KCl(s). The 
equation for the formation reaction of 1 mol of KCl(s) is
K1s2 + 1
2  Cl21g2 ¡  KCl1s2
Reaction (c) does not form a substance from its elements. Instead, 
a substance decomposes to its elements, so this reaction must be 
reversed. Next, the element carbon is given as diamond, whereas 
graphite is the standard state of carbon at room temperature and  
1 atm pressure. The equation that correctly represents the enthalpy 
of formation of glucose from its elements is
6 C1graphite2 + 6 H21g2 + 3 O21g2 ¡  C6H12O61s2
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If the heat of formation of H2O1l2 is -286 kJ>mol, which  
of the following thermochemical equations is correct?
(a) 2 H1g2 + O1g2 ¡ H2O1l2 
 
∆H = -286 kJ
(b) 2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2  
∆H = -286 kJ
(c) H21g2 + 1
2  O21g2 ¡ H2O1l2 
 
∆H = -286 kJ
(d) H21g2 + O1g2 ¡ H2O1g2 
 
∆H = -286 kJ
(e) H2O1l2 ¡ H21g2 + 1
2  O21g2 
 
∆H = -286 kJ
