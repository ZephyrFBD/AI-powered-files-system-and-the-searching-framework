few varieties (sometimes only one) of the
many wild varieties of a plant are used. Meanwhile, wild varieties in their native habitats are lost due to habit
destruction or other human impacts. In addition, a monoculture, by definition, has no genetic variation, and is
extremely susceptible to changing environmental conditions. For example, potato crops infected with potato blight, a
fungal disease, resulted in widespread crop failures and famine in the middle of the nineteenth century in Ireland.
The overuse of antibiotics reduces variation in bacterial populations by eliminating those individuals that are
susceptible to the antibiotic. In the absence of the susceptible individuals, however, nonsusceptible bacteria increase
in number and dominate the population, causing new outbreaks of disease.
Causes of Changes in Allele Frequencies
Natural selection was the mechanism that Darwin proposed for evolution. With the understanding of genetics, it
became evident that factors other than natu
