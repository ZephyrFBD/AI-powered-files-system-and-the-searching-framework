um of an electron in 
an atom (Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle).
 
6.5 ▶ Quantum Mechanics and Atomic 
Orbitals Describe how the electron 
exists in the hydrogen atom by treating it 
as if it were a wave. The wave functions 
that mathematically describe the electron’s 
position and energy in an atom are called 
atomic orbitals. Each orbital is characterized 
by a set of quantum numbers.
 
6.6 ▶ Representations of Orbitals  
Consider the three-dimensional shapes of 
orbitals and how they can be represented by 
graphs of electron density.
 
6.7 ▶ Many-Electron Atoms Learn that the 
energy levels of an atom having more than 
one electron are different from those of the 
hydrogen atom, and that each electron has an 
additional quantum-mechanical property called 
spin. The Pauli exclusion principle states that 
no two electrons in an atom can have the same 
four quantum numbers. Therefore, each orbital 
can hold a maximum of two electrons.
