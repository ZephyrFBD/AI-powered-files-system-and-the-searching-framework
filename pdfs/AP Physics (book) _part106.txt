ite shore.
From a map, you estimate the distance to the opposite shore as 
Use
Fig. 1–14 with
to estimate the radius R of the Earth.
APPROACH We use simple geometry, including the theorem of Pythagoras,
where c is the length of the hypotenuse of any right triangle, and a and b are
the lengths of the other two sides.
SOLUTION For the right triangle of Fig. 1–14, the two sides are the radius of
the Earth R and the distance
The hypotenuse is approx-
imately the length 
where
By the Pythagorean theorem,
We solve algebraically for R, after cancelling 
on both sides:
NOTE Precise measurements give 6380 km. But look at your achievement!
With a few simple rough measurements and simple geometry, you made a
good estimate of the Earth’s radius. You did not need to go out in space, nor
did you need a very long measuring tape.
