 the vaulter must be raised. By bending their bodies, pole
vaulters keep their CM so low that it can actually pass slightly beneath the bar 
(Fig. 6–21), thus enabling them to cross over a higher bar than would otherwise 
be possible. (Center of mass is covered in Chapter 7.)
As another example of the conservation of mechanical energy, let us consider
an object of mass m connected to a compressed horizontal spring (Fig.6–13b) whose
own mass can be neglected and whose spring stiffness constant is k. When the spring
is released, the mass m has speed v at any moment. The potential energy of the
system (object plus spring) is 
where x is the displacement of the spring from
its unstretched length (Eq. 6–9). If neither friction nor any other force is acting,
conservation of mechanical energy tells us that
