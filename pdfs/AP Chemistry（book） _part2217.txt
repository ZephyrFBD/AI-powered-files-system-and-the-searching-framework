For a first-order reaction, therefore, a graph of  ln3A4t versus time gives a straight line with 
a slope of -k and a y-intercept of  ln3A40. A reaction that is not first order will not yield a 
straight line.
As an example, consider the conversion of methyl isonitrile 1CH3NC2 to its isomer 
acetonitrile 1CH3CN2 (Figure 14.6). Because experiments show that the reaction is first 
order, we can write the rate equation:
ln3CH3NC4t = -kt + ln3CH3NC40
We run the reaction at a temperature at which methyl isonitrile is a gas 1199 °C2, and Fig-
ure 14.7(a) shows how the pressure of this gas varies with time. Figure 14.7(b) shows that 
a plot of the natural logarithm of the pressure versus time is a straight l
