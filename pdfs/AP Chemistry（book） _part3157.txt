bers below the equation show that the oxidation number of Zn 
changes from 0 to +2, while that of H changes from +1 to 0. Thus, this is an oxidation–
reduction reaction. Electrons are transferred from zinc atoms to hydrogen ions; Zn is oxi-
dized and H+ is reduced.
In a reaction such as Equation 20.2, a clear transfer of electrons occurs. In some reac-
tions, however, the oxidation numbers change, but we cannot say that any substance 
literally gains or loses electrons. For example, in the combustion of hydrogen gas,

[20.3]
hydrogen is oxidized from the 0 to the +1 oxidation state and oxygen is reduced from the 
0 to the -2 oxidation state, indicating that Equation 20.3 is an oxidation–reduction reac-
tion. While keeping track of oxidation states offers a convenient form of “bookkeeping,” 
you should not generally equate the oxidation state of an atom with its actual charge in a 
chemical compound.
