her direction completely abolishes synthesis of that protein
in prokaryotes, termination of transcription by an interaction between RNA polymerase
and the rho protein at a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template
termination sequence-dependent termination of prokaryotic mRNA synthesis; caused by hairpin
formation in the mRNA that stalls the polymerase
direct alteration of one or more nucleotides in an mRNA that has already been synthesized
(AGGAGG); initiates prokaryotic translation by interacting with rRNA molecules
comprising the 30S ribosome
short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment
molecules synthesized by RNA polymerase III that have a variety of functions, including splicing
pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors
process of removing introns and reconnecting exons in a pre-mRNA
AUG (or rarely, GUG) on an mRNA from which translation begins; always specifies methionine
conserved promoter sequence in eukaryotes and prokaryotes that he
