warf whose mass is
equal to the Sun’s and whose radius is equal to the Earth’s.
How many times larger than Earth’s density is this?
10. (II) A neutron star whose mass is 1.5 solar masses has a
radius of about 11 km. Calculate its average density and
compare to that for a white dwarf (Problem 9) and to that
of nuclear matter.
*11. (II) A star is 56 pc away. What is its parallax angle? State
(a) in seconds of arc, and (b) in degrees.
*12. (II) What is the parallax angle for a star that is 65 ly away?
How many parsecs is this?
*13. (II) A star is 85 pc away. How long does it take for its light
to reach us?
1.3 * 103 Wm2.
6 * 1010 m
14. (III) Suppose two stars of the same apparent brightness b
are also believed to be the same size. The spectrum of one
star peaks at 750 nm whereas that of the other peaks at
450 nm. Use Wien’s law and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation
(Eq. 14–6) to estimate their relative distances from us.
[Hint: See Examples 33–4 and 33–5.]
