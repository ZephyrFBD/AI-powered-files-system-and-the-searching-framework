EXAMPLE 13;15
EXERCISE E If molecules of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas were placed in the same balloon
at room temperature, how would the average kinetic energies of the molecules compare?
(a) They would be the same. (b) The hydrogen molecules would have greater kinetic energy.
(c) The oxygen molecules would have greater kinetic energy. (d) Need more information.
Equation 13–8 holds not only for gases, but also applies reasonably accurately
to liquids and solids. Thus the result of Example 13–15 would apply to molecules
within living cells at body temperature (37°C).
We can use Eq. 13–8 to calculate how fast molecules are moving on average.
Notice that the average in Eqs. 13–5 through 13–8 is over the square of the speed.
The square root of 
is called the root-mean-square speed,
(since we are
taking the square root of the mean of the square of
