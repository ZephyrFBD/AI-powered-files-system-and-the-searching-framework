SOLUTION We assume the motion is along the 
axis (Fig. 4–6). We are
given the initial velocity 
(Section 1–6), the final
velocity  
and the distance traveled  
From Eq. 2–11c, we
have
so
The net force required is then
or 
The force must be exerted in the direction opposite to the initial
velocity, which is what the negative sign means.
NOTE If the acceleration is not precisely constant, then we are determining an
“average” acceleration and we obtain an “average” net force.
Newton’s second law, like the first law, is valid only in inertial reference frames
(Section 4–2). In the noninertial reference frame of a car that begins accelerating,
a cup
