as a lower 
ionization energy than argon; because the valence electrons are 
not as strongly attracted to the nucleus, they are more readily pro-
moted to a state in which the atom can form bonds with fluorine. 
Also, Xe is larger and can more easily accommodate an expanded 
octet of electrons. 22.31 (a) Ca1OBr22, Br, + 1 (b) HBrO3, Br, + 5 
(c) XeO3, Xe, + 6 (d) ClO4

22.35 (a) van der Waals intermolecular attractive forces increase 
with increasing number of electrons in the atoms. (b) F2 reacts 
with water: F21g2 +  H2O1l2 ยก  2 HF1g2 + O21g2. That is, fluo-
rine is too strong an oxidizing agent to exist in water. (c) HF has 
extensive hydrogen bonding. (d) Oxidizing power is related to
