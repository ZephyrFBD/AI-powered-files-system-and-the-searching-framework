17. (II) (a) What is the acceleration of two falling sky divers
(total 
including parachute) when the upward
force of air resistance is equal to one-fourth of their weight?
(b) After opening the parachute, the divers descend
leisurely to the ground at constant speed. What now is the
force of air resistance on the sky divers and their parachute?
See Fig. 4–44.
