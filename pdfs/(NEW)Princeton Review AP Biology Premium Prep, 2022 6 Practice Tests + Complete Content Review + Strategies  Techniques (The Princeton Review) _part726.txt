he ones that
could live in the extremes of dry or moist soil survived to make up the next generation.
d. Justify your prediction.
The population used to have a bell-curve with most of the individuals liking medium moisture and then a few liking the
extremes. After 40 years it changed and the extremes were favored. This is called disruptive selection. Something
happened that made the extreme amounts of soil moisture better to live at than the medium level of moisture.
Question 5
a. Explain the importance of diploid and haploid cells in sexual reproduction.
Diploid cells have two copies of every gene. Haploid cells have only one copy of every gene. In sexual reproduction two
haploid gametes must come together and create diploid offspring. This is better than asexual reproduction because it
creates genetic diversity.
b. Explain what the genotype of an individual with no shading would be. If you use abbreviations, be sure to
indicate what they represent.
An individual without any shading w
