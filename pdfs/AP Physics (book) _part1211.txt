 Fig. 11–40 are different “resonant modes of vibration.” A stand-
ing wave on a cord is the result of the interference of two waves traveling in
opposite directions. A standing wave can also be considered a vibrating object at
resonance. Standing waves represent the same phenomenon as the resonance of
an oscillating spring or pendulum, which we discussed in Section 11–6. However,
a spring or pendulum has only one resonant frequency, whereas the cord has 
an infinite number of resonant frequencies, each of which is a whole-number
multiple of the lowest resonant frequency.
Consider a string stretched between two supports that is plucked like a guitar
or violin string, Fig. 11–41a. Waves of a great variety of frequencies will travel in
both directions along the string, will be reflected at the ends, and will travel back
in the opposite direction. Most of these waves interfere with each other and
quickly die out. However, those waves that correspond to the resonant frequen-
cies of the str
