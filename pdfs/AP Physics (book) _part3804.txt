,
and that nucleons make up only (a) 2% of the mass
needed, or (b) 5% of the mass needed.
2. Describe how we can estimate the distance from us to other
stars. Which methods can we use for nearby stars, and which
can we use for very distant stars? Which method gives the
most accurate distance measurements for the most distant
stars?
3. The evolution of stars, as discussed in Section 33–2, can
lead to a white dwarf, a neutron star, or even a black hole,
depending on the mass. (a) Referring to Sections 33–2 and
33–4, give the radius of (i) a white dwarf of 1 solar mass,
(ii) a neutron star of 1.5 solar masses, and (iii) a black hole
of 3 solar masses. (b) Express these three radii as ratios
.
4. (a) Describe some of the evidence that the universe began
with a “Big Bang.” (b) How does the curvature of the uni-
verse affect its future destiny? (c) How does dark energy
affect the possible future of the universe?
