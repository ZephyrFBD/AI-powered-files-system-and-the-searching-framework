reactions. As indicated above, some cyanobacteria do this. Other nitrogen-fixing bacteria have
mutualistic relationships with plants; that is, both the bacteria and the host plant benefit from an interdependent
relationship. The bacteria live in nodules, specialized structures in plant roots.
5. Heterotrophic bacteria (chemoheterotrophic bacteria) obtain their carbon and energy from organic molecules.
These bacteria include parasites, pathogens, and decomposers. Other heterotrophic bacteria form mutualistic
relationships with their hosts. For example, many of the bacteria in our digestive tract provide us with vitamins and
other nutrients while processing material that we cannot digest. In addition, these bacteria compete with pathogenic
bacteria, limiting their growth and their potential for causing illness.
Adhesive proteins on the surface of bacteria help them attach to substrates. Some bacteria, in a cooperation-like
behavior, release signaling molecules that recruit other bacteria
