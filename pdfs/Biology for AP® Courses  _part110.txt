Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree
In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and
bacteria. The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology,
biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. The pioneering work of
American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved
along three lineages, now called domainsâ€”Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic
cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the
eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding
bacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (see this
figure). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme
