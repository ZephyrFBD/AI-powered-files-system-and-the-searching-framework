A spacecraft with mass
825 kg approaches Saturn. When far from Saturn, it moves

The gravitational attrac-
tion of Saturn (a conservative force) acting on the spacecraft
causes it to swing around the planet (orbit shown as dashed
line) and head off in the opposite direction. Estimate the
final speed of the spacecraft after it is far enough away to
be considered free of Saturn’s gravitational pull.
