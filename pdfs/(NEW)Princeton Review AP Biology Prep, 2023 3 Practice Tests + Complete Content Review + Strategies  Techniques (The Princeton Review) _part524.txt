eriment, so it
was impossible to form these two amino acids under the conditions of the experiment.

B
Silica is a mineral form of glass, is not a common component of life-forms, and is largely chemically inert.
Since oxygen is already present in several compounds included in the experiment, the addition of this
compound does not provide any additional elements or chemical substrates that would permit generation of
additional amino acids or synthesis of nucleic acids. The addition of sulfur compounds and phosphorus is
necessary to generate some amino acids and all nucleic acids, which eliminates (A), (C), and (D).
10. A
All isotopes of hydrogen will contain one proton, by definition. All atoms that have only one proton are
identified as hydrogen. Tritium is an isotope that has one proton and two neutrons, for a total of three particles
in its nucleus. Choice (A) is correct. Choice (B) is not correct because two protons would mean that the
element is helium, not hydrogen. Choice (C) i
