al to plant survival. Although temperature and light intensity influence plant growth, they are not reliable
indicators of season because they may vary from one year to the next. Day length is a better indicator of the time of year.
As stated above, unfiltered sunlight is rich in red light but deficient in far-red light. Therefore, at dawn, all the phytochrome
molecules in a leaf quickly convert to the active Pfr form, and remain in that form until sunset. In the dark, the Pfr form
takes hours to slowly revert back to the Pr form. If the night is long (as in winter), all of the Pfr form reverts. If the night
is short (as in summer), a considerable amount of Pfr may remain at sunrise. By sensing the Pr/Pfr ratio at dawn, a plant
can determine the length of the day/night cycle. In addition, leaves retain that information for several days, allowing a
comparison between the length of the previous night and the preceding several nights. Shorter nights indicate springtime
to the plant; when
