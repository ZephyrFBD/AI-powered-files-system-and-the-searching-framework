on on the string and the vibration in the air have the same wavelength.
(b) They have the same frequency.
(c) They have the same speed.
(d) Neither wavelength, frequency, nor speed are the same in the air as on the string.
S
ound is associated with our sense of hearing and, therefore, with the physi-
ology of our ears and the psychology of our brain, which interprets the
sensations that reach our ears. The term sound also refers to the physical
sensation that stimulates our ears: namely, longitudinal pressure waves.
We can distinguish three aspects of any sound. First, there must be a source
for a sound; as with any mechanical wave, the source of a sound wave is a vibrating
object. Second, the energy is transferred from the source in the form of longitu-
dinal sound waves in air or other material. And third, the sound is detected, usually
by an ear or by a microphone. We start by looking at sound waves themselves.
