 the collision is elastic, the kinetic energy of our system of two particles is
conserved and we can use Eq. 7–7, which becomes
Thus
and substituting this into our momentum equation displayed above, we get
Solving for 
we obtain
The other unknown is 
which we can now obtain from
The minus sign for 
tells us that the proton reverses direction upon collision,
and we see that its speed is less than its initial speed (see Fig. 7–15).
NOTE This result makes sense: the lighter proton would be expected to “bounce
back”from the more massive helium nucleus, but not with its full original velocity
as from a rigid wall (which corresponds to extremely large, or infinite, mass).
