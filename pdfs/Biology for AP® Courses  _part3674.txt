em is effectively a network of cylindrical vessels: the arteries, veins, and capillaries that emanate from a
pump, the heart. In all vertebrate organisms, as well as some invertebrates, this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is
not free in a cavity. In a closed circulatory system, blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally
from the heart around the systemic circulatory route, then returns to the heart again, as illustrated in Figure 31.2a. As
opposed to a closed system, arthropods—including insects, crustaceans, and most mollusks—have an open circulatory
system, as illustrated in Figure 31.2b. In an open circulatory system, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is
pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid. As
the heart beats and the animal moves, the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters
the hearts through openings called
