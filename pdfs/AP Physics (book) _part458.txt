round the circle (Fig. 5–1). Because acceleration is defined as the rate of change
of velocity, a change in direction of velocity is an acceleration, just as a change in
its magnitude is. Thus, an object revolving in a circle is continuously accelerating,
even when the speed remains constant (
in Fig. 5–1). We now investi-
gate this acceleration quantitatively.
Acceleration is defined as
where 
is the change in velocity during the short time interval 
We will
eventually consider the situation in which 
approaches zero and thus obtain
the instantaneous acceleration. But for purposes of making a clear drawing,
Fig. 5–2, we consider a nonzero time interval. During the time interval 
the
particle in Fig. 5–2a moves from point A to point B, covering a distance 
along the arc which subtends an angle 
The change in the velocity vector is
and is shown in Fig. 5–2b (note that  
).
Now we let 
be very small, approaching zero. Then 
and 
are also 
very small, and 
will be almost parallel to
