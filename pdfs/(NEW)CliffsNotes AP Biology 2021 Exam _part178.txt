The oxygen is released. One of the H+combines with NADP+and the 2
 
electrons from noncyclic photophosphorylation to produce NADPH. NADPH is then used to supply energy to the
Calvin cycle.
 
The light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) combine CO2, NADPH, and ATP to form G3P and RuBP. It takes 6
CO2to create 2 G3P, so the cycle
repeats 6 times to produce 2 G3P. The 2 G3P form glucose. Glucose can then be used to make various other
carbohydrates, such as sucrose and starch, or it can be broken down to release its store of energy in the form of ATP
to drive metabolic activities.
This is a thorough answer. Another way to answer this question would be to discuss these processes as they occur in
the chloroplast. In other words, focus on the activities of chemiosmosis. Illustrations such as those in this chapter
would also get you points.

All cells in a multicellular organism have the same genetic makeup. How then do cells become different, and how
are the
