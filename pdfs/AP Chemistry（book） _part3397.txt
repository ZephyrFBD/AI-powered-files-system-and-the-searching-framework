 chemist must quickly incorporate the radionuclide 
into the sugar (or other appropriate) molecule and inject the com-
pound immediately. The patient is placed in an instrument that mea-
sures the positron emission and constructs a computer-based image 
of the organ in which the emitting compound is localized. When the 
element decays, the emitted positron quickly collides with an elec-
tron. The positron and electron are annihilated in the collision, pro-
ducing two gamma rays that move in opposite directions. The gamma 
rays are detected by an encircling ring of scintillation counters 
 
(Figure 21.10). Because the rays move in opposite directions but were 
created in the same place at the same time, it is possible to accurately 
locate the point in the body where the radioactive isotope decayed. 
The nature of this image provides clues to the presence of disease or 
other abnormality and helps medical researchers understand how a 
particular disease affects the functioning of the br
