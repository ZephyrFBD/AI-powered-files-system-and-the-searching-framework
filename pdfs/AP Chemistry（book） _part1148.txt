After oxygen, the most important member of group 6A is sulfur. This element exists 
in several allotropic forms, the most common and stable of which is the yellow solid hav-
ing the molecular formula S8. This molecule consists of an eight-membered ring of sulfur 
atoms (Figure 7.27). Even though solid sulfur consists of S8 rings, we usually write it sim-
ply as S(s) in chemical equations to simplify the stoichiometric coefficients.
Like oxygen, sulfur has a tendency to gain electrons from other elements to form 
sulfides, which contain the S2- ion. In fact, most sulfur in nature is present as metal sul-
fides. Sulfur is below oxygen in the periodic table, and the tendency of sulfur to form 
sulfide anions is not as great as that of oxygen to form oxide ions. As a result, the chem-
istry of sulfur is more complex than that of oxygen. In fact, sulfur and its compounds
