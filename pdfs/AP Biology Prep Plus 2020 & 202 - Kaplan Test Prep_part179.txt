e contractions of the heart are powered by ATP, so (A) is correct. (B)
is incorrect because muscle cells need large amounts of mitochondria
to contract, not to synthesize proteins. While muscles do contain large
amounts of proteins, turnover is slow and proteins are continuously
made. (C) is incorrect because liver cells do contain some
mitochondria, just fewer than other tissue types, as can be seen in the
graph. (D) is incorrect because the amount of mitochondria varies in
accordance with the function of the tissue.

Based on the information provided, cell membranes require a
significant proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in order to maintain
fluidity at low temperatures. Thus, B. psychrophilus needs to contain a
larger proportion of unsaturated fatty acids because it tends to be
found at lower temperatures, making (D) correct. (A) is incorrect
because there is a correlation found in the table: temperature is
inversely correlated with unsaturated fatty
