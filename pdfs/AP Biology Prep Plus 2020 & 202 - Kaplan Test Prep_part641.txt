Codominance is an inheritance pattern that occurs when
neither of the alleles is completely recessive or dominant. In
the heterozygote, both alleles are expressed equally in the
phenotype. For instance, the oﬀspring of a plant with red
flowers and a plant with white flowers might express both red
and white petals. Another example of codominance is the ABO
blood groups of humans. The A and B alleles are codominant to
each other (O is recessive), so a person with AB blood expresses
both A and B antigens on red blood cells.
Multiple allele inheritance involves more than two alleles
coding for a certain trait, which results in more than two
phenotypes. Human blood type (ABO) is an example of
multiple allele inheritance.
Polygenic inheritance is a type of inheritance in which several
interacting genes control a single trait. Many traits result from
the additive influences of multiple genes; skin color is one
common example of a
