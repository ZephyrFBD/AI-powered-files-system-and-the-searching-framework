 design. You are designing an airport for small
planes. One kind of airplane that might use this airfield must reach a speed 
before takeoff of at least 
and can accelerate at 
(a) If the runway is 150 m long, can this airplane reach the required speed for
takeoff? (b) If not, what minimum length must the runway have?
APPROACH Assuming the plane’s acceleration is constant, we use the kinematic
equations for constant acceleration. In (a), we want to find 
and what we are
given is shown in the Table in the margin.

2–6 Solving Problems
Before doing more worked-out Examples, let us look at how to approach problem
solving. First, it is important to note that physics is not a collection of equations to
be memorized. Simply searching for an equation that might work can lead you
to a wrong result
