 X-linkage; hemizygosity makes descriptions of
dominance and recessiveness irrelevant
having two different alleles for a given gene on the homologous chromosome
having two identical alleles for a given gene on the homologous chromosome
process of mating two individuals that differ with the goal of achieving a certain characteristic in their
offspring
in a heterozygote, expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an
intermediate phenotype
in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic
genes do not influence each other with regard to sorting of alleles into gametes; every
possible combination of alleles is equally likely to occur
paired unit factors (i.e., genes) segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal
likelihood of inheriting any combination of factors
phenomenon in which alleles that are located in close proximity to each other on the same chromosome are more
likely to be inherited
