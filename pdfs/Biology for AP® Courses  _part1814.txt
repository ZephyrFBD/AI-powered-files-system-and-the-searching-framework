R to increase or decrease the RNA stability
ribosomal subunit that binds to the RNA to translate it into protein
transcription factor binding site found outside the promoter or on another chromosome that
influences the transcription of a particular gene
protein that binds to the DNA at the promoter or enhancer region and that influences transcription of
a gene
sequence of DNA to which a transcription factor binds
site at which transcription begins
series of genes necessary to synthesize tryptophan in prokaryotic cells
amino acid that can be synthesized by prokaryotic cells when necessary
segment of the RNA molecule that are not translated into protein. These regions lie before
(upstream or 5') and after (downstream or 3') the protein-coding region
CHAPTER SUMMARY
16.1 Regulation of Gene Expression
While all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA, not all cells within that organism express the same
proteins. Prokaryotic organisms express the entire DNA they encode in ever
