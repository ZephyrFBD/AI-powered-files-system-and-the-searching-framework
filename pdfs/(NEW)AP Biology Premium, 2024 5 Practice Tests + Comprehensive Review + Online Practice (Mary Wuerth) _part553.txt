 Predator species eat prey species and depend on prey populations for food. Insufficient
numbers of prey species will lead to declining numbers of predator species. As the number of prey increase,
predator numbers will follow with an increase in numbers. Fluctuations in the numbers of predators generally
follow fluctuations in the numbers of prey, as shown in Figure 23.3.

Niche partitioning: Competing species may coexist if they use the resources available in their habitat
differently; this is known as niche partitioning. Competing species in a habitat may use dietary partitioning. An
example of this is on the African savanna, where some animal species are grazers and eat grass, while other
animal species in the same habitat are browsers and eat tree leaves. This allows them to coexist in the same
habitat. Anole lizards exhibit habitat partitioning, with some anoles living in the forest canopy and others on the
ground.
