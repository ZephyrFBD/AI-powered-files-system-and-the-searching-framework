36. (III) Revisit Example 3–7, and assume that the boy with
the slingshot is below the boy in the tree (Fig. 3–40) and
so aims upward, directly at the boy in the tree. Show that
again the boy in the tree makes the wrong move by letting
go at the moment the water balloon is shot.

37. (III) A stunt driver wants to make his car jump over 8 cars
parked side by side below a horizontal ramp (Fig. 3–41).
(a) With what minimum speed must he drive off the hori-
zontal ramp? The vertical height of the ramp is 1.5 m above
the cars and the horizontal distance he must clear is 22 m.
(b) If the ramp is now tilted upward, so that “takeoff angle”
is 7.0° above the horizontal, what is the new minimum
speed?
