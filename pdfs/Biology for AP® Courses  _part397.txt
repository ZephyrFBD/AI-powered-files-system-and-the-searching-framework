Introduction
Close your eyes and picture a brick wall. What is the basic building block of that wall? A single brick, of course. Like a
brick wall, your body is composed of basic building blocks called “cells.”
Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as a home is made from a variety of
building materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial cells protect the surface of
the body and cover the organs and body cavities within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Immune system
