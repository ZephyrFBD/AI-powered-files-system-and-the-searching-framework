demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called codons. The insertion of
one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent
amino acid (Figure 15.4). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation,
the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.
Figure 15.4 The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein
message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.
Scientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they
specified (Figure 15.5).
Figure 15.5 This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a
termination signal in a nascent protein. (credit: mo
