eart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles
contract. This pause allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The
electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using
electrodes. This information can be observed as an electrocardiogram (ECG)â€”a recording of the electrical impulses of
the cardiac muscle.

Figure 31.14 The beating of the heart is regulated by an electrical impulse that causes the characteristic reading of an
ECG. The signal is initiated at the sinoatrial valve. The signal then (a) spreads to the atria, causing them to contract.
The signal is (b) delayed at the atrioventricular node before it is passed on to the (c) heart apex. The delay allows the
atria to relax before the (d) ventricles contract. The final part o
