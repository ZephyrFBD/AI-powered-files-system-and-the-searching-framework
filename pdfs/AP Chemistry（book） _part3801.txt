the stability of Organic Compounds
Carbon forms strong bonds with a variety of elements, especially H, O, N, and the halo-
gens. 
 (Sections 5.8 and 8.8) Carbon also has an exceptional ability to bond to itself, 
forming a variety of molecules made up of chains or rings of carbon atoms. Most reac-
tions with low or moderate activation energy 
 (Section 14.5) begin when a region 
of high electron density in one molecule encounters a region of low electron density in 
another molecule. The regions of high electron density may be due to the presence of 
a multiple bond or to the more electronegative atom in a polar bond. Because of their 
strength (the C ¬C single bond enthalpy is 348 kJ>mol, the C ¬H bond enthalpy is 
413 kJ>mol 
 Tables 5.4 and 8.3) and lack of polarity, both C ¬C single bonds and 
C ¬H bonds are relatively unreactive. To better understand the implications of these 
facts,
