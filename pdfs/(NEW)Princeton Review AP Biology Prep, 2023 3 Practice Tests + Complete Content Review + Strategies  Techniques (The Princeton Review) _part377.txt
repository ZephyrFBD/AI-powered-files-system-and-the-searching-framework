nucleotides, called codons. Each tRNA has a region called the
anticodon that is complementary to a codon. Sometimes the pairing is not the normal base-pairing. This is
called wobble pairing.
When a tRNA binds, it brings the corresponding amino acid to add to the growing polypeptide.
Gene expression is regulated primarily by transcription factors influencing transcription (pre-transcriptional
regulation), RNAi after transcription (post-transcriptional regulation), and by various reactions and regulators
after translation (post-translational regulation). This regulation is dynamic and can either increase or decrease
gene expression, RNA levels, and protein levels according to the needs of the cell.
Mutations can result from changes in the DNA message or the mRNA message.
Mutations can be small (single nucleotide swaps, additions, or deletions) or large (big chunks or entire
chromosomes are swapped, duplicated, or deleted).
Some examples of biotechnology are:
