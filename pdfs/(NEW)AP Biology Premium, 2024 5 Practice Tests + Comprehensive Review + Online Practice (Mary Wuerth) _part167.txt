st efficiently at optimum temperatures and pHs that are specific to the enzyme. If the
temperature in the environment is too low, the rate of collisions between the enzyme and its substrate will be
reduced, and the reaction will slow down. If the temperature is too high, bonds that hold the enzyme together may be
disrupted, and the shape of the enzyme can be altered. Similarly, a pH that is too far from optimum can disrupt
bonds in the enzyme and result in a change in its tertiary structure. Changes to the ionic environment of an enzyme
can also disrupt bonds in the enzyme. A change to an enzyme’s structure is called denaturation, and this can limit
the enzyme’s ability to catalyze chemical reactions. Sometimes, but not always, denaturation can be reversed when
the environment returns to more optimum conditions.
Competitive inhibitors are similar in shape to substrates and compete with substrates for the active site of an
enzyme, see Figure 7.2. This competition lowers the rate of enzy
