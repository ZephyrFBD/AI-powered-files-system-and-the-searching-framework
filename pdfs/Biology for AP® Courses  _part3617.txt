creased ventilation further down in the lung. As a result, the intrapleural pressure is more negative at the base
of the lung than at the top, and more air fills the bottom of the lung than the top. Likewise, it takes less energy to pump
blood to the bottom of the lung than to the top when in a prone position. Perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing
or sitting. This is a result of hydrostatic forces combined with the effect of airway pressure. An anatomical shunt develops
because the ventilation of the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways. As a result,
the rate of gas exchange is reduced. Note that this does not occur when lying down, because in this position, gravity does
not preferentially pull the bottom of the lung down.
A physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area. This will decrease
ventilation but not affect perfusion; therefore, the V/Q ratio changes and gas exchange is
