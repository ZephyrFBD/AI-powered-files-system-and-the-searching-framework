forces can be operating in a given substance or mixture. Note that dispersion forces occur in all  
substances.

Each molecule can form two 
hydrogen bonds with a neighbor.
Each molecule can form one 
hydrogen bond with a neighbor.
▲ Figure 11.15 Hydrogen bonding in acetic 
acid and 1-propanol. The greater the number 
of hydrogen bonds possible, the more 
tightly the molecules are held together and, 
therefore, the higher the boiling point.
