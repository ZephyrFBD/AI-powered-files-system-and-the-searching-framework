m sunlight. Even though an exergonic reaction can occur spontaneously, it
may not. Before most reactions can occur, activation energy is required to contort or destabilize the reactants. The
necessary activation energy can be lowered by the presence of a catalyst (such as a metal ion or an enzyme).
However, the free energy of a reaction is not changed by the presence of a catalyst (Figure 4-1).

Most metabolic reactions are endergonic (positive Δ G) and require an input of energy. That energy usually comes
from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (ΔG = -7.3 kcal/mol). The
hydrolysis of ATP (an exergonic reaction, negative ΔG) occurs in tandem, or coupled, with the endergonic
metabolic reaction. The coupling usually involves the transfer of energy with one of the inorganic phosphates (Pi)
from ATP to one of the reactants, as shown in Figure 4-2. Coupled
reactions with ATP (and with the help of specific enzymes) are typical of most ende
