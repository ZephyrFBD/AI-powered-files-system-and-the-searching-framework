ed range of the species. Human transportation of people and goods, including
the intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of species into new ecosystems,
sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and outside the range of the
speciesâ€™ natural predators.
Most exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor adaptation to
the ecosystem they enter. Some species, however, possess preadaptations that can make them especially successful in a new
ecosystem. These exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological
conditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there. For this reason, exotic species are also called
invasive species. Exotic species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease.
