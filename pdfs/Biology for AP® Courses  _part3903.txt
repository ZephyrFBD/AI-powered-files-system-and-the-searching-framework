Effects of Cytokine Release
The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines, which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to
be destroyed along with any infected cells. A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and
function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to affect immune responses. At least 40 types of cytokines exist
in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they
produce. One type cytokine, interferon, is illustrated in Figure 33.4.
One subclass of cytokines is t
