 have learned earlier, these FAD+ molecules can transport fewer ions; consequently, fewer ATP molecules
are generated when FAD+ acts as a carrier. NAD+ is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD+ acts in the brain.
Another factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate compounds in
these pathways are used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all
other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. For
example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. Moreover, the five-carbon
sugars that form nucleic acids are made from intermediates in glycolysis. Certain nonessential amino acids can be made
from intermediates of both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are also made
from intermediates in these pathways, and b
