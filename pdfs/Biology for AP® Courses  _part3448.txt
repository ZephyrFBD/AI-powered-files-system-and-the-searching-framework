and some aquatic organisms, it is not an efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals.
Exoskeleton
An exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism. For example, the
shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons (Figure 29.3). This skeleton type provides defence against predators, supports
the body, and allows for movement through the contraction of attached muscles. As with vertebrates, muscles must cross
a joint inside the exoskeleton. Shortening of the muscle changes the relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton.
Arthropods such as crabs and lobsters have exoskeletons that consist of 30â€“50 percent chitin, a polysaccharide derivative
of glucose that is a strong but flexible material. Chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells. The exoskeleton is further
strengthened by the addition of calcium carbonate in organisms such as the lobster. Because the exoskeleton is acellular,
arthropods mu
