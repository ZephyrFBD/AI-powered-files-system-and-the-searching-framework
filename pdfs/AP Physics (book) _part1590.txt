The copper end is placed in a furnace maintained at a con-
stant temperature of 205°C. The aluminum end is placed in
an ice bath held at a constant temperature of 0.0°C. Calculate
the temperature at the point where the two rods are joined.

Problem 59.
59. In a typical squash game (Fig. 14–21), two people hit a soft
rubber ball at a wall. Assume that the ball hits the wall at a
velocity of 
and bounces back at a velocity of 
and that the kinetic energy lost in the process heats the ball.
What will be the temperature increase of the ball after one
bounce? (The specific heat of rubber is about 
)

wall and emerges at a speed of 
If the bullet absorbs
50% of the heat generated, (a) what will be the temperature
rise of the bullet? (b) If the bullet’s initial temperature was
20°C, will any of the bullet melt, and if so, how much?
