Heating of an object by radiation from the Sun cannot be calculated using
Eq. 14–7 since this equation assumes a uniform temperature,
of the environ-
ment surrounding the object, whereas the Sun is essentially a point source. Hence
the Sun must be treated as a separate source of energy. About 1350 J of energy
from the Sun strikes Earth’s atmosphere per second per square meter of area at
right angles to the Sun’s rays. This number,
is called the solar constant.
The atmosphere may absorb as much as 70% of this energy before it reaches the
ground, depending on the cloud cover. On a clear day, about 
reaches
the Earth’s surface. An object of emissivity 
with area A facing the Sun absorbs
energy from the Sun at a rate, in watts, of about

where is the angle between the Sun’s rays and a line perpendicular to the area A
(Fig. 14–11). That is,
is the “effective” area, at right angles to the Sun’s
rays.
