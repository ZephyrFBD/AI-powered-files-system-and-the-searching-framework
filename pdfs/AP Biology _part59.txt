 exposed to HSP. Both trials are identical
except for the presence or absence of HSP.
What is the best explanation for what is demonstrated by this
experiment?
HSP is critical to normal ribosome function.
Proper folding of a polypeptide is critical for a protein to
function properly.
HSP can cause mutations in DNA, with the result that a normal
