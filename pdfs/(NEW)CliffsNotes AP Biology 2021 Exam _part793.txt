nt to the number of cells successfully transferred (transformants).
To calculate the amount of DNA transferred, you need to know each of the values listed below. Values for common
protocols are provided as an example.
If there were 22 bacteria colonies on the agar plate,
then
 
Part III: Design Your Own Investigation
Design an experiment to investigate any questions that may have occurred to you while doing parts I and II.
Consider the effects of mutations from UV light or chemicals (caffeine, theobromine, food preservatives, etc.) or
changes in the transformation protocol. If available, consider the use of other plasmids, such as those that produce
fluorescent markers (e.g., green fluorescent protein, GFP).
Investigation 9: Restriction Enzyme Analysis of DNA
Part I: Review Restriction Enzymes
Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are used to cut up DNA. A restriction enzyme cleaves a DNA
molecule at a specific sequence of nucleotides, producing cuts that are usually jagged,
