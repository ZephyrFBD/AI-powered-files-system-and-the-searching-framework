acetone, 1CH322CO, is 360 
torr, and that of chloroform, CHCl3, is 300 torr. Acetone 
and chloroform can form very weak hydrogen bonds be-
tween one another; the chlorines on the carbon give the 
carbon a sufficient partial positive charge to enable this 
behavior:

 A solution composed of an equal number of moles of 
acetone and chloroform has a vapor pressure of 250 torr 
at 35 °C. (a) What would be the vapor pressure of the 
solution if it exhibited ideal behavior? (b) Based on the 
behavior of the solution, predict whether the mixing of 
acetone and chloroform is an exothermic 1∆Hsoln 6 02 or 
endothermic 1∆Hsoln 7 02 process.

(a) The turbidity (the amount of light scattering) of solu-
tions increases dramatically at the cmc. Suggest an ex-
planation. (b) The ionic conductivity of the solution 
dramatically changes at the cmc. Suggest an explanation. 
(c) Chemists have developed fluorescent dyes that glow 
brightly only when
