 A thin film of soap 
coats a piece of flat glass
How thick is the film if it reflects 643-nm red
light most strongly when illuminated normally by white light?
85. When violet light of wavelength 415 nm falls on a single
slit, it creates a central diffraction peak that is 8.20 cm wide
on a screen that is 3.15 m away. How wide is the slit?
(n = 1.52).

The Wave Nature of Light
A: 333 nm;
B: 2.5 mm.
C: Narrower.
D: A.
6.0 * 1014 Hz; 2.0 * 108 ms.
E: (e).
F: Zero for both (a) and (b), because the two successive
polarizers at 90° cancel all light. The 45° Polaroid must be
inserted between the other two if transmission is to occur.
ANSWERS TO EXERCISES
1. Compare Figs. 24–5, 24–6, and 24–7, which are different
representations of the double-slit experiment. For each
figure state the direction the light is traveling. Where are
the wave crests in terms of this direction? How are they
represented in each figure? Give one advantage of each
figure in helping y
