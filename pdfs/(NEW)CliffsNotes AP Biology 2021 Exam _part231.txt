tempted. If repair is unsuccessful, apoptosis ensues.
The M checkpoint, occurring during metaphase, ensures that microtubules are properly attached to all kinetochores
at the metaphase plate before division continues with anaphase. mitogenic signal

2. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Cdks are proteins responsible for advancing the cell past the checkpoints and
through the cell cycle. Cdks have the following attributes:
Cdks are kinases. Kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins. Once phosphorylated, the protein is
energized and ready to act. Proteins can be inactivated by dephosphorylation or by destruction by other enzymes.
Cdks are activated by cyclins. Cyclins are proteins that attach to Cdks, altering their conformation and readying
them for activation. Complete activation requires phosphorylation. Without a cyclin attached, a Cdk is inactive
(that’s why it’s described as “cyclin dependent”).
Mitosis-promoting factor (or maturation-promoting factor) (MPF) is
