hable from the rest of the answer and not simply implied in another part of the 
response. 
 
Discussion of how THREE factors might affect the physiology and/or behavior resulting in the 
cyclic activity pattern (1 point each) 
To earn points here, each of the descriptions had to (a) be biologically plausible and consistent with 
typical mammalian behavior and physiology (no fictional biology); (b) indicate a cause and effect 
relationship beyond a simple restatement of the question. This had to include at least a very brief 
indication of how or why the factor had any effect at all on the bombat â€” or in some cases its prey; and 
finally, the discussion could not be inconsistent with the part of the curve described or time of day 
referenced in the explanation. 
 
Elaboration on any one of the three factors (1 point) 
Here the readers were looking for exemplary descriptions of physiology and/or behavior that reflected an 
unusual depth of understanding and clarity of expression. With s
