ble. If we keep lowering the temperature, do we reach a state in which these 
motions are essentially shut down, a point described by a single microstate? This ques-
tion is addressed by the third law of thermodynamics:
The entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at absolute zero is zero: S10 K2 = 0.
Consider a pure, perfect crystalline solid. At absolute zero, the individual atoms or 
molecules in the lattice would be perfectly ordered in position. Because none of them 
would have thermal motion, there is only one possible microstate. As a result, Equa-
tion 19.5 becomes S = k ln W = k ln 1 = 0. As the temperature is increased from abso-
lute zero, the atoms or molecules in the crystal gain energy in the form of vibrational 
motion about their lattice positions. This means that the degrees of freedom and the 
entropy both increase. What happens to the entropy, however, as we continue to heat 
the crystal? We consider this important question in the next section.
