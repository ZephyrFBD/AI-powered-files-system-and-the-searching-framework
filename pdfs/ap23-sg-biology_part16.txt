(a) 
Describe how a scientist would use a comparison of the DNA sequences of different 
organisms to suggest the most likely evolutionary relationship among the organisms. 
• 
The (DNA) sequences of organisms that are more closely related are more similar 
(than those of organisms that are less closely related).  
1 point 
(b) 
 Based on Figure 1, explain why Bovidae is likely to be more closely related to Moschidae 
than it is to Giraffidae. 
Accept one of the following: 
• 
(The molecular data/Figure 1B support(s) this relationship, and) molecular data are 
more reliable (than are morphological data). 
• 
(The molecular data/Figure 1B support(s) this relationship.) Morphological similarities 
may not reliably indicate evolutionary relatedness.  
1 point 
(c) 
Using the template in the space provided for your response, represent the point(s) at 
which characteristic 1, listed in Table 1, evolved by
