pH is important for biological reactions. Solutions may be acidic, basic or alkaline, or neutral.
Organic molecules contain carbon atoms. Many molecules in biology are composed of several monomers bound
together into polymers. The creation of these polymers occurs through dehydration synthesis reactions. The
breakdown of these polymers occurs through hydrolysis reactions.
Important organic macromolecules in biology include:
Carbohydrates: monosaccharides link by glyosidic bonds to form di- and polysaccharides. Examples are
glucose, fructose, glycogen, cellulose, and starch.
Proteins: 20 different amino acids, each with a different R-group, link together via peptide bonds to form
polypeptides. The chain further folds up into special shapes to make the final protein structure. The
structure can be divided into primary (amino acid seq
