the
matching mRNA. You find that the mRNA is considerably
shorter than the DNA sequence. Why is that?
a.
There was an experimental mistake. The mRNA
should have the same length as the gene.
b.
The mRNA should be longer than the DNA
sequence because the promoter is also
transcribed.
c.
The processed mRNA is shorter because introns
were removed.
d.
The mRNA is shorter because the signal
sequence to cross the nuclear membrane was
removed.
49. A mutation in the promoter region of the gene for the
beta-globin can cause beta-thalassemia, a hereditary
condition which causes anemia. Why would mutations in
the promoter region lead to low levels of hemoglobin?
a.
The globin chains produced are too long to form
functional hemoglobin.
b.
The globin chains are too short to form
functional hemoglobin.
c.
Fewer globin chains are synthesized because less
mRNA is transcribed.
d.
Globin chains do not fold properly and are non-
functional.

You are given three mRNA sequences:
