agnetic spectrum does this lie?
APPROACH We use Eq. 27–10,
with the energies obtained from
Fig. 27–29 to find the energy and the wavelength of the transition. The region 
of the electromagnetic spectrum is found using the EM spectrum in Fig. 22–8.
SOLUTION In this case,
Since
we have
or 122 nm, which is in the UV region of the EM spectrum, Fig. 22–8. See also
Fig. 27–25, where this value is confirmed experimentally.
NOTE An alternate approach: use Eq. 27–16 to find 
and get the same result.
Wavelength of a Balmer line. Use the Bohr model to
determine the wavelength of light emitted when a hydrogen atom makes a
transition from the
to the 
energy level.
APPROACH We can use Eq. 27–16 or its equivalent, Eq. 27–9, with
SOLUTION We find
So
or 410 nm. This is the fourth line
in the Balmer series, Fig. 27–24, and is violet in color.
Absorption wavelength. Use Fig. 27–29 to determine the
maximum wavelength that hydrogen in its ground state can absorb. What would
be the next smaller wavelength t
