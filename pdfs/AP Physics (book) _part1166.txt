sts of a small object (the pendulum bob) suspended
from the end of a lightweight cord, Fig. 11–11. We assume that the cord does not
stretch and that its mass can be ignored relative to that of the bob. The motion of
a simple pendulum moving back and forth with negligible friction resembles sim-
ple harmonic motion: the pendulum bob oscillates along the arc of a circle with
equal amplitude on either side of its equilibrium point, and as it passes through
the equilibrium point (where it would hang vertically) it has its maximum speed.
But is it really undergoing SHM? That is, is the restoring force proportional to its
displacement? Let us find out.
