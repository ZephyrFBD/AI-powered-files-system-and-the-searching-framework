or, when the first letter is already “taken”
by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for
carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements’ chemical symbols derive from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for
sodium is Na, referring to natrium, the Latin word for sodium.
The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). In the non-
living world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare
on the earth as a whole, as shown in Table 2.1. For example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains
little carbon and hydrogen, while the earth’s crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little
nitrogen and carbon. In spite of their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey
the same chemical and physical laws regard
