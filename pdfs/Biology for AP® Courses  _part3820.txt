life. Bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however,
prokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa,
and fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some
leucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosisâ€”the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane
within the cells. The same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. In

some unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as the amoeba, shown in Figure 32.10, cellular wastes and excess water are
excreted by exocytosis, when the contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment.
Contractile vacuoles (CV) should not be confused with vacuoles, which store food or wa
