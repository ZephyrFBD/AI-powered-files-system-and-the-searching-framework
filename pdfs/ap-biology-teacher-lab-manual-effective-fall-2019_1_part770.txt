ied enzyme from a common 
soil fungus has a pH optimum of 5.5. The main enzyme for this lab, peroxidase, is found 
in many different forms, with optimum pHs ranging from 4 to 11 depending on the 
source and optimum temperatures varying from 10 to 70Â°C.

One suggestion for extending the inquiry activities in this lab is to have students 
compare peroxidase extracted from different vegetables. Ask them, What could you 
predict based on what you know about how each vegetable grows? What observations could 
you make of the vegetables before extracting enzyme? With this prompt, it is very likely 
that one or more students will think about potential differences in tissue pH or normal 
growing temperature for root versus leaf versus fruit. A pH test strip would give a 
reasonable estimate of tissue pH, and there will be a large difference (which students can 
look up or measure themselves) in the average temperature o
