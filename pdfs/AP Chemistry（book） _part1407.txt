 ¬F bonds, in accord 
with experiment. How can we use valence-bond theory to describe the bonding? The 
electron configuration of F 11s22s22p52 indicates an unpaired electron in a 2p orbital. 
This electron can be paired with an unpaired Be electron to form a polar covalent bond. 
Which orbitals on the Be atom, however, overlap with those on the F atoms to form the 
Be ¬F bonds?
The orbital diagram for a ground-state Be atom is
2s
2p
1s
Because it has no unpaired electrons, the Be atom in its ground state cannot bond with 
the fluorine atoms. The Be atom could form two bonds, however, by envisioning that we 
“promote” one of the 2s electrons to a 2p orbital:
2s
2p
1s
The Be atom now has two unpaired electrons and can therefore form two polar covalent 
bonds with F atoms. The two bonds would not be identical, however, because a Be 2s 
orbital would be used to form one of the bonds and a 2p orbital would be used to form 
the other. Therefore, although the promotion of an electron allows
