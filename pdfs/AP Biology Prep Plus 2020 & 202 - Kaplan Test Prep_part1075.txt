it to be more common in males and
to skip generations. Both of these occur in this pedigree. The grandfather at the top of the
tree expresses the trait. If the gene in question were sex-linked, the father would pass on his
X chromosome to all of his daughters. If the trait were dominant, all of his daughters would
express the trait. The daughters do not express the trait, so the answer is sex-linked
recessive. This pedigree could also exist for an autosomal recessive allele.
(b) Identify the genotype for the grandmother at the top of the tree. (1 point maximum)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
None of the offspring of the grandfather and grandmother exhibit the trait. Thus, the
grandmother cannot be homozygous recessive. The grandmother could be either a
heterozygous carrier or homozygous dominant and still produce the pedigree.
(c) Calculate the likelihood that a female in the fourth generation expresses the
disorder. (1 point)
