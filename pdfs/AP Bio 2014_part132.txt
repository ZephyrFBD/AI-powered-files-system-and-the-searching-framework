nt and prevent ATP
synthesis 
Proton gradient has sufficient energy 
to drive ATP synthesis. 
pH is a measure of proton 
concentration; higher proton 
concentration --> lower pH 
Protons move through ATP 
synthase from intermembrane 
space to matrix and produce 
ATP 
Electron transport 
chain is in IMM 
and creates a 
proton gradient 
Electron transport
chain is in IMM 
and leads to ATP 
synthesis 
NADH/FADH2 are oxidized by 
electron carriers and electrons  
move through complex finally 
reducing O2 to H2O.
ETC results in most ATP in cellular 
respiration. 
Proton gradient has sufficient energy
to drive ATP synthesis. 
Protons accumulate across the 
membrane  
ATP can be produced by incubating 
isolated mitochondria with low pH 
buffer and ADP + Pi 
Energy from oxidizing 
NADH/FADH2 is converted to 
energy in proton gradient 
(PMF) energy in gradient can
be coupled to ATP synthesis 
Protons move through ATP 
synthase from intermembrane 
space to matrix and produce 
ATP 
IMM is the sit
