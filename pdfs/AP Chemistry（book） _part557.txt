both sides of a complete ionic equation, called specta-
tor ions, play no direct role in the reaction. Spectator ions can be canceled, like alge-
braic quantities, on either side of the reaction arrow, since they are not reacting with 
anything. Once we cancel the spectator ions, we are left with the net ionic equa-
tion, which is one that includes only the ions and molecules directly involved in the 
reaction:
 
Pb2+1aq2 + 2 I-1aq2 ยก PbI21s2 
[4.7]
Because charge is conserved in reactions, the sum of the ionic charges must be 
the same on both sides of a balanced net ionic equation. In this case, the 2+ charge 
of the cation and the two 1-  charges of the anions add to zero, the charge of the 
electrically neutral product. If every ion in a complete ionic equation is a spectator, no 
reaction occurs.
Give It Some Thought
Which ions, if any, are spectator ions in this reaction?
