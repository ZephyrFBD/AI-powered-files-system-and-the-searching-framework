ecessary in bacterial cell division. Bacterial cytokinesis is directed by a ring
composed of a protein called FtsZ. Ingrowth of membrane and cell wall material from the periphery of the cells results in
the formation of a septum that eventually constructs the separate cell walls of the daughter cells.
