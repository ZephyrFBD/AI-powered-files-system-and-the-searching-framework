 ยก Cu2+1aq2 + NO21g2
2 Cl-1aq2 ยก Cl21g2
We can check this result by looking at the 
oxidation state changes. Each chromium atom 
goes from +6 to +3, gaining three electrons; 
therefore, the two Cr atoms in Cr2O7
2- gain six 
electrons, in agreement with our half-reaction.
In the second half-reaction, two Cl- are 
required to balance one Cl2:
We add two electrons to the right side to 
attain charge balance:
2 Cl-1aq2 ยก Cl21g2 + 2 e-
This result agrees with the oxidation state 
changes. Each chlorine atom goes from -1 
to 0, losing one electron; therefore, the two 
chlorine atoms lose two electrons.
Step 3: We equalize the number of electrons 
transferred in the two half-reactions. To do 
so, we multiply the Cl half-reaction by 3 so 
that the number of electrons gained in the 
Cr half-reaction (6) equals the number lost in 
the Cl half-reaction, allowing the electrons to 
cancel when the half-reactions are added:
6 Cl-1aq2 ยก 3 Cl21g2 + 6 e-
Step 4: The equations are added to give the
