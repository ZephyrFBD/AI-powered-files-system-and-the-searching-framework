nd Cellular Disruptions of Homeostasis
1. Foreign toxic substances enter the organism and are detected by multiple cells, tissues, and organs in
order to expel them from the organism and reinstate homeostasis.
2. The body combats these disruptions through physiological and immunological responses.
3. When homeostasis cannot be maintained in a human or animal, medical interventions are needed. If
that is not possible, disease and/or death will occur.
C. Disruptions to an Ecosystem’s Homeostasis—these disruptions can come from the following sources:
1. Other species—can disrupt the homeostasis of another species through predation or parasitism. An
example is the introduction of the Emerald Ash Borer in North America. North American trees had no
defenses against this Asian beetle, and it has decimated forests and decreased the biodiversity once
maintained in the forests.
2. Direct human impact—humans can impact not only their ecosystems but also those of other species.
An example is conta
