direction and the unknown atom travels away at a 
angle. What is the mass (in u) of the unknown atom?
[Hint: You could use the law of sines.]

in the CO molecule is
How far from the carbon atom is the
center of mass of the molecule?

51. (II) The CM of an empty 1250-kg car is 2.40 m behind the
front of the car. How far from the front of the car will the
CM be when two people sit in the front seat 2.80 m from 
the front of the car, and three people sit in the back seat
3.90 m from the front? Assume that each person has a mass
of 65.0 kg.
