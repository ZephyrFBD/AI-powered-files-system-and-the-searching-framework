2 DIATOMIC MOLECULES (SECTION 9.8) 
 
Electrons in core orbitals do not contribute to the bonding between 
atoms, so a molecular orbital description usually needs to consider 
only electrons in the outermost electron subshells. To describe the 
MOs of period 2 homonuclear diatomic molecules, we need to con-
sider the MOs that can form by the combination of p orbitals. The p 
orbitals that point directly at one another can form s bonding and 
s* antibonding MOs. The p orbitals that are oriented perpendicu-
lar to the internuclear axis combine to form pi 1P2 molecular orbitals. 
In diatomic molecules, the p molecular orbitals occur as a pair of 
degenerate (same energy) bonding MOs and a pair of degenerate 
antibonding MOs. The s
2p bonding MO is expected to be lower in 
energy than the p
2p bonding MOs because of larger orbital overlap of 
the p orbitals directed along the internuclear axis. However, this order-
ing is reversed in B2, C2, and N2 because of interaction between the 2s
