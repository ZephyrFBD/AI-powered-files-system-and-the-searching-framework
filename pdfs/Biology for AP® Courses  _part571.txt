sides or halves (Figure 5.11). On both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are
different concentrations of a dissolved substance, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the concentrations
on each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane). If the volume of the solution on both sides of the

membrane is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent,
on either side of the membrane.
Figure 5.11 In osmosis, water always moves from an area of higher water concentration to one of lower concentration.
In the diagram shown, the solute cannot pass through the selectively permeable membrane, but the water can.
To illustrate this, imagine two full glasses of water. One has a single teaspoon of sugar in it, whereas the second one contains
