PLASMIDS
Mainly found in bacteria, plasmids also naturally occur in some archaea
and eukaryotes such as yeast and plants. Plasmids are small, double-
stranded circular DNA molecules that are separate from the
chromosomal DNA. Plasmids may carry genes that benefit the survival of
the organism by providing a selective advantage. For example, plasmids
may encode for antibiotic resistance, the production of toxins in a
competitive environment, or the utilization of particular organic
compounds when nutrients are scarce. Possessing its own origin of
replication, a plasmid can replicate independently from its hostâ€™s
chromosomal DNA.
In genetic engineering, recombinant plasmids are used as vectors to
clone and amplify or express particular genes. The advantages of using
plasmids as vectors include the ability to easily modify and mass-
produce them.
