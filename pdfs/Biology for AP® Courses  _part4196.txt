travel about 5,000 km (3,100 mi) each year to find food. Amphibians and reptiles
are more limited in their distribution because they lack migratory ability. Not all animals that can migrate do so: migration
carries risk and comes at a high energy cost.
Some animals hibernate or estivate to survive hostile temperatures. Hibernation enables animals to survive cold conditions,
and estivation allows animals to survive the hostile conditions of a hot, dry climate. Animals that hibernate or estivate
enter a state known as torpor: a condition in which their metabolic rate is significantly lowered. This enables the animal to
wait until its environment better supports its survival. Some amphibians, such as the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), have an
antifreeze-like chemical in their cells, which retains the cellsâ€™ integrity and prevents them from bursting.
Water
Water is required by all living things because it is critical for cellular processes. Since terrestrial organisms lose water to the
