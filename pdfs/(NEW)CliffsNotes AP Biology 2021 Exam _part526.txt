example, and bacteria or other organisms enter the body, the following events occur:
Histamine is secreted by mast cells, white blood cells found in connective tissue.
Vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels), stimulated by histamine, increases blood supply to the damaged area and
allows for easier movement of white blood cells (and other body fluids) through blood vessel walls. This additional
blood also causes redness, an increase in temperature, and swelling. The increase in temperature, like a fever, may
stimulate white blood cells, and they may make the environment inhospitable to pathogens.
Phagocytes, attracted to the injury by chemical gradients of complement, arrive and engulf pathogens and damaged
cells.
Complement helps phagocytes engulf foreign cells, stimulate basophils to release histamine, and help lyse, or
destroy, foreign cells.
The immune response is the third line of defense. It differs from the inflammatory response and other nonspecific
mechanisms in that it target
