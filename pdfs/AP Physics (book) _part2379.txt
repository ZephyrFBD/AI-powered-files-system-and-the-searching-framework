PLE 21;14
A relationship between the applied voltage and the current in a capacitor can
be written just as for an inductance:
(21;12a)
where 
is called the capacitive reactance and has units of ohms. V and I can
both be rms or both maximum (
and );
depends on both the capacitance C
and the frequency f:
(21;12b)
where
For dc conditions,
and 
becomes infinite, as it should
because a capacitor does not pass dc current.

capacitor also passes ac and not dc. In this case, a dc voltage can be maintained
between circuits A and B, but an ac signal leaving A passes to ground instead of
into B. Thus the capacitor in Fig. 21–42b acts like a filter when a constant dc voltage
is required; any sharp variation in voltage passes to ground instead of into 
circuit B.
EXERCISE F The capacitor C in Fig. 21–42a is often called a “high-pass” filter, and the
one in Fig. 21–42b a “low-pass” filter. Explain why.
