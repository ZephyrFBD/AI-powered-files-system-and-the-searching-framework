their units, and observe any trends or patterns in the data.
■Do NOT be afraid of organisms or genes you may not have heard of before. There are so many great
examples of organisms, genes, and ecosystems that apply to the content of the AP Biology course, and no
teacher or textbook can mention all of them. Any example that is not explicitly included in the AP Biology
Course and Exam Description will be described in enough detail in the question so that you will have enough
background information to answer the question. Therefore, don’t worry if you see a question about the
CYP6M2 gene in Anopheles gambiae and you’ve never heard of either before! The stem of the question will

insecticide resistance to Anopheles mosquitoes), so all you need to do is apply your knowledge and ski
