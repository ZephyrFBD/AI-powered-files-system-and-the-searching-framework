ts to a protein
channel of some sort. ATP synthase molecules have a very different
appearance with a rotor that spins on the cytosol side. (ENE-2)
(B) Bacteria like E. coli are prokaryotes. They do not have any
internal membranes. Although human red blood cells do not have a
nucleus, they did have one before they matured and left the bone

marrow. Human bone cells, osteoblasts, or osteocytes are part of the
human bodyâ€”thus, they are eukaryotic cells. Two domains,
Bacteria and Archaea, include all prokaryotes. (EVO-1 & ENE-2)
(D) Looking at the illustration, you can see that sucrose is going
against the gradient. Therefore, you can eliminate choices A and B.
Protons are pumped against their gradient in order to create a proton
gradient. As shown in the illustration, as protons flow down their
gradient, they apparently carry sucrose with them. (ENE-2)
(B) This is the definition of quorum sensing, a phenomenon in
bacteria
