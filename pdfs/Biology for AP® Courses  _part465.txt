ter the cell. A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called
macrophages, which are part of your body’s immune system. In a process known as phagocytosis or endocytosis, a section
of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with
the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a
lysosome. The lysosome’s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen (Figure 4.21).
Figure 4.21 A macrophage has engulfed (phagocytized) a potentially pathogenic bacterium which then fuses with a
lysosome within the cell to destroy the pathogen. Other organelles are present in the cell but for simplicity are not
shown.
Activity
Homemade Cell Project. Using inexpensive and common household items, create a model of a specific
eukaryotic cell (e.g., neuron, white blood cell, plant root cell, or Paramecium) that demonstrates how at least
three organelles work
