s in volume that you measure that may be attributed to changes in temperature 
and air pressure. 
Figure 6 shows how the microrespirometer works. 
O2 
The microrespirometer is placed 
in a water bath to help maintain 
a constant temperature. 
CO2 combines with KOH to form a solid 
K2CO3. As a result, the CO2 is removed 
from the air in the microrespirometer. 
Cotton protects the organism at the bottom 
of the microrespirometer from corrosive KOH. 
CO2 
The air is a mixture 
of O2 and other gases.

■ Analyzing Results 
1. Use your data table to construct a graph. Your goal is to determine respiration rate. 
How should you plot your data? Which variable will be on the x-axis, and which will 
be on the y-axis? 
2. From the graph, determine the rate of respiration for the germinating seeds at 
20°C. Hint: Go back and think about what the units of measurement would be for
