re, ∆n = 2 - 1 = 1,  and Kp = Kc1RT2, for this re-
action. In our derivation gas pressures are expressed as atmospheres and concentra-
tions in moles per liter, thus the appropriate form of the gas constant is R = 0.08206 
L-atm/mol-K.
Give It Some Thought
Is it possible to have a reaction where Kc = Kp? If so, under what conditions would 
this relationship hold?
For the Haber process,
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2
Kc = 9.60 at 300 °C. Calculate Kp for this reaction at this temperature.
Sample Exercise 15.2
 Converting between Kc and Kp
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given Kc for a reaction and asked to calculate Kp.
Plan The relationship between Kc and Kp is given by Equation 15.15. 
To apply that equation, we must determine ∆n by comparing the 
number of moles of product with the number of moles of reactants 
(Equation 15.16).
Solve With 2 mol of gaseous products 12 NH32 and 4 mol of gaseous 
reactants 11 N2 + 3 H22, ∆n = 2 - 4 = -2. (Remember that ∆ 
functions are always based on products min
