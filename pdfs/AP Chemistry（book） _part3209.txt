 2 Cl-1aq2 + I21s2
Solve
(a) We ﬁrst must identify the oxidation and reduction half- 
reactions that when combined give the overall reaction.
Analyze We are given two reactions and must determine whether 
each is spontaneous.
Plan To determine whether a redox reaction is spontaneous under 
standard conditions, we first need to write its reduction and 
oxidation half-reactions. We can then use the standard reduction 
potentials and Equation 20.10 to calculate the standard emf, E°, 
for the reaction. If a reaction is spontaneous, its standard emf 
must be a positive number.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following elements is capable of oxidizing 
Fe2+1aq2 ions to Fe3+1aq2 ions: chlorine, bromine, iodine?  
(a) I2 (b) Cl2 (c) Cl2 and I2 (d) Cl2 and Br2 (e) all three elements
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Using the standard reduction potentials listed in Appendix E, 
determine which of the following reactions are spontaneous 
under standard conditions:
Reduction:
