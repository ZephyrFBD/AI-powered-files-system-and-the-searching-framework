hemical energy in photosynthesis or
transferred from one organism (a plant) to its consumer (insect), some
energy will be lost as heat during the transfer.
In terrestrial ecosystems, productivity (or energy capture) is generally
estimated by the change in biomass of plants produced over a specific time
period. Measuring biomass or changes in biomass is simple. Take the mass
of the organism(s) and record the mass over various time intervals.
Consider also that different organic compounds store different amounts
of energy. Proteins and carbohydrates store about 4 kcal/g of dry weight.
Fats store about 9 kcal/g of dry weight.
You must take this into consideration as you carry out your
investigation.
