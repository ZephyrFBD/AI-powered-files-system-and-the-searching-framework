ng organisms that use DNA as their genetic material, viruses may use either DNA or RNA as theirs.
The virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus. Viral genomes tend to be small, containing only
those genes that encode proteins that the virus cannot get from the host cell. This genetic material may be single- or double-
stranded. It may also be linear or circular. While most viruses contain a single nucleic acid, others have genomes that have
several, which are called segments.

In DNA viruses, the viral DNA directs the host cellâ€™s replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome
and to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins. DNA viruses cause human diseases such as chickenpox and
hepatitis B.
RNA viruses contain only RNA as their genetic material. To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the RNA viruses
encode enzymes that can replicate RNA into DNA, which cannot be done by the host cell. These RNA
