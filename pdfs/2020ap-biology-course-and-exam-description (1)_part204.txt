ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.K.1
Hardy-Weinberg is a model for describing and 
predicting allele frequencies in a nonevolving 
population. Conditions for a population or 
an allele to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
are—(1) a large population size, (2) absence 
of migration, (3) no net mutations, (4) random 
mating, and (5) absence of selection. These 
conditions are seldom met, but they provide a 
valuable
