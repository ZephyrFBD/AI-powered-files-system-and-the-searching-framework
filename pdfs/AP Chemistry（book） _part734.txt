 temperature change produced by a given 
quantity of heat varies from substance to substance. The temperature change experi-
enced by an object when it absorbs a certain amount of heat is determined by its heat 
capacity, denoted C. The heat capacity of an object is the amount of heat required to 
raise its temperature by 1 K (or 1 °C). The greater the heat capacity, the greater the heat 
required to produce a given increase in temperature.
For pure substances the heat capacity is usually given for a specified amount of the 
substance. The heat capacity of one mole of a substance is called its molar heat capac-
ity, Cm. The heat capacity of one gram of a substance is called its specific heat capacity, 
or merely its specific heat, Cs. The specific heat, Cs, of a substance can be determined 
experimentally by measuring the temperature change, ∆T, that a known mass m of the 
substance undergoes when it gains or loses a specific quantity of heat q:
