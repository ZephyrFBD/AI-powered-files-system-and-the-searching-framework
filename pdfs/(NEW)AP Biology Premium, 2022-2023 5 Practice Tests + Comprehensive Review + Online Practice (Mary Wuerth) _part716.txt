he sections of the protein coded by exon 10 and exon 17 are missing from CFTR
protein. Which type of mutation is most likely the cause of this?
(A) nonsense mutation
(B) translocation between two nonhomologous chromosomes
(C) mutation in a splice site
(D) point mutation, which changes a codon for a hydrophilic amino acid to a codon for a hydrophobic amino
acid
49. The most common mutation, F508del, deletes a single amino acid, resulting in slight misfolding of the protein.
The cell detects and destroys these abnormal proteins. A combination of two medications (Lumacaftor and
Ivacaftor) can help reduce some of the symptoms in patients with this mutation. What is the most likely
mechanism of action of the two medications?
(A) activation of CFTR gene transcription in patients with the F508del mutation
(B) repression of the number of ribosomes in patients with the F508del mutation
(C) correction of a premature stop codon in the middle of the F508del mutation
(D) help for the CFTR protein t
