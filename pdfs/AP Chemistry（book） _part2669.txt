s ago. Assume that 
carbonic acid 1H2CO32 formed by the reaction of CO2 and 
water is the only factor influencing pH.
CO21g2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H2CO31aq2
 
 (b) What volume of CO2 at 25 °C and 1.0 atm is dissolved 
in a 20.0-L bucket of today’s rainwater?
 16.120  
At 50 °C, the ion-product constant for H2O has the value 
Kw = 5.48 * 10-14. (a) What is the pH of pure water at 
50 °C? (b) Based on the change in Kw with temperature, 
predict whether ∆H is positive, negative, or zero for the 
autoionization reaction of water:
2 H2O1l2 ∆ H3O+1aq2 + OH-1aq2
 16.121  
In many reactions, the addition of AlCl3 produces the 
same effect as the addition of H+. 
 
 (a) Draw a Lewis structure for AlCl3 in which no atoms 
carry formal charges, and determine its structure using the 
VSEPR method. 
 
 (b) What characteristic is notable about the structure in part 
(a) that helps us understand the acidic character of AlCl3?
 
 (c) Predict the result of the reaction between AlCl3 and 
NH3 in a solvent that doe
