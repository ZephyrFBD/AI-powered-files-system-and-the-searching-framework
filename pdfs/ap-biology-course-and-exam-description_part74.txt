LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.A
Describe the structural 
similarities and differences 
between DNA and RNA.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.A.1
DNA and RNA molecules have structural 
similarities and differences related to their 
function—
a. Both DNA and RNA have three 
components—sugar, a phosphate group, 
and a nitrogenous base—that form 
nucleotide units that are connected by 
covalent bonds to form a linear molecule 
with 5’ and 3’ ends, with the nitrogenous 
bases perpendicular to the sugar-phosphate 
backbone.
b. The basic structural differences between 
DNA and RNA include the following:
	
DNA contains deoxyribose and RNA 
contains ribose.
 ii. RNA contains uracil and DNA 
contains thymine.
iii. DNA is usually double stranded; RNA is 
usually single stranded.
iv. The two DNA strands in double-stranded 
DNA a
