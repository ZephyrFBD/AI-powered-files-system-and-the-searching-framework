eighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between
the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually
oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a hydrogen bond. This type of bond is common
and occurs regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur
in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also
responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.
Like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals
attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities,
which are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to
one another. These
