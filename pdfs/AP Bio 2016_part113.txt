6. Neuromodulin is an essential protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates. Researchers compared the 
first 60 amino acids of the neuromodulin protein from each of five different species. The results are shown in the 
table above. 
Based on the data in the table, construct a cladogram on the template provided to represent the evolutionary 
relatedness of the five species. Using the data, justify the placement of the zebra fish on the cladogram. On the 
cladogram, circle the p
