 (a) Is the solution process exothermic or 
endothermic? (b) Why does the solution form?
 13.19  (a) In Equation 13.1, which of the enthalpy terms for dis-
solving an ionic solid would correspond to the lattice en-
ergy? (b) Which energy term in this equation is always 
exothermic?
 13.20  For the dissolution of LiCl in water, ∆Hsoln = -37 kJ>mol. 
Which term would you expect to be the largest negative 
number: ∆Hsolvent, ∆Hsolute, or ∆Hmix?
 13.21  Two nonpolar organic liquids, hexane 1C6H142 and heptane 
1C7H162, are mixed. (a) Do you expect ∆Hsoln to be a large 
positive number, a large negative number, or close to zero? 
Explain. (b) Hexane and heptane are miscible with each 
other in all proportions. In making a solution of them, is 
the entropy of the system increased, decreased, or close to 
zero, compared to the separate pure liquids?

is +19.8 kJ/mol. Which of the following statements pro-
