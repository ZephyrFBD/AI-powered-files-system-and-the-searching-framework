 cm. If a baseball had the same mass per unit
volume (see Tables in Section 1–5) as a neutron or a proton,
about what would its mass be?
1–7 Order-of-Magnitude Estimating
(Note: Remember that for rough estimates, only round numbers
are needed both as input to calculations and as final results.)
25. (I) Estimate the order of magnitude (power of 10) of:
(a) 2800, (b) 
(c) 0.0076, and (d)
26. (II) Estimate how many books can be shelved in a college
library with 
of floor space. Assume 8 shelves high,
having books on both sides, with corridors 1.5 m wide.
Assume books are about the size of this one, on average.
27. (II) Estimate how many hours it would take to run (at
) across the U.S. from New York to California.
28. (II) Estimate the number of liters of water a human
drinks in a lifetime.
29. (II) Estimate how long it would take one person to mow
a football field using an ordinary home lawn mower
(Fig. 1–15). (State your assumption, such as the mower
moves with a 
speed, and has a 0.5-m
