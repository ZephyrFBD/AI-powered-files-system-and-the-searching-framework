ses. You find that adding more substrate has no effect on the
decrease in formation of AB. Which of the following is most likely
the explanation for what substance X is?
competitive inhibitor of the enzyme
noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme
competitive inhibitor of substance A
competitive inhibitor of substance B
You perform an enzyme-controlled reaction: A + B + enzyme →
AB + energy. You monitor and record your results on the chart

Based on your results, which of the following is true?
The enzyme works best when the pH is alkaline.
The enzyme was most active at pH 4.6.
The temperature must have increased and then decreased
during the course of the experiment.
An accelerator must have been added to the system.
Below is an equation for a simple enzyme-controlled experiment:
A + B + enzyme → AB
