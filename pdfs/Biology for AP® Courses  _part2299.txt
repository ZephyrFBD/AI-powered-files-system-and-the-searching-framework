eveloped from
mitochondria that had been released from
eukaryotic cells.
d.
Some hypotheses propose that eukaryotic cells
developed from gram-negative bacteria. Others
propose that they developed from gram-positive
bacteria. Still others hypothesize that both gram-
positive and gram-negative bacteria contributed
to the eukaryotic genome through horizontal
gene transfer.
18. Explain the ring of life model.
a.
The ring of life model is a phylogenetic model
where the three domains of life started as distinct
groups that could swap genes horizontally with
each other in all directions.
b.
The ring of life model is a phylogenetic model
where all three domains of life are said to have
developed from a pool of primitive prokaryotes.
c.
The ring of life model is a phylogenetic model
where bacterial and archaeal cells fused to form
eukaryotic cells.
d.
The ring of life model is a phylogenetic model
where there is only a single domain of life due to
modern DNA analysis.
