 the history of science who 
could truly be called an adventurer. In 1804, he ascended to 23,000 ft in a hot-air bal-
loon—an exploit that held the altitude record for several decades. To better control the 
balloon, Gay-Lussac studied the properties of gases. In 1808, he observed the law of 
combining volumes: At a given pressure and temperature, the volumes of gases that react 
with one another are in the ratios of small whole numbers. For example, two volumes of 
hydrogen gas react with one volume of oxygen gas to form two volumes of water vapor. 
 (Section 3.1)
Three years later, Amedeo Avogadro interpreted Gay-Lussac’s observation by propos-
ing what is now known as Avogadro’s hypothesis:
Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain  
equal numbers of molecules.
For example, 22.4 L of any gas at 0 °C and 1 atm contain 6.02 * 1023 gas molecules (that 
is, 1 mol), as depicted in Figure 10.8.
Avogadro’s law follows from Avogadro’s hypothesis:
The volume of a ga
