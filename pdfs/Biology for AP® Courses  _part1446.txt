Polyploidy
An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid. For
instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid
animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards.
Polyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter
cells that cannot yield viable zygotes. Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an
unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and
polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species (Figure 13.8).
