Practice Exam 2 Answers and Explanations
SECTION I
1. A
Cell diﬀerentiation depends upon the selective transcription of the genome, which is
fully included in all of the cells of an organism. That a mature root cell can dediﬀerentiate
is not so surprising, given the fact that it contains all the genes necessary to produce any
type of cell distinctive to the species of plant. (A) is thus correct. (B) is factually
inaccurate; all cells contain the same genetic blueprint (with at most minor diﬀerences
arising from occasional mutations during development). (C) is incorrect because there is
not enough information about the tissue culture to reach this conclusion. (D) is incorrect
because additional stimulation is not necessary for mRNA transcripts to be translated.
2. B
In human males (who have only one X chromosome), one copy of a recessive gene will be
expressed because there is no dominant copy to mask its expression. (B) is therefore
correct. (A) is incorrect because X-linked recessiv
