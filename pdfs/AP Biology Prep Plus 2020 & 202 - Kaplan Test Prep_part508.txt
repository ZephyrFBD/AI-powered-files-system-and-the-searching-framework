, positive feedback systems are
considered unstable. To use an ecological example, positive feedback can
be seen with climate change. An initially small perturbation in the
environment can positively feed back onto itself, growing and growing
until the problem yields huge eﬀects on the climate.
Negative feedback is the opposite of positive feedback. As more feedback
is received, it causes the processes that brought about the initial change
to slow down or stop altogether. Self-regulating systems tend to function
by using negative feedback. It allows for stability within a system because
it reduces the eﬀects of fluctuations. Negative feedback loops allow a
system to have the necessary amount of correction at the most important
time. One of the simplest examples of negative feedback is one of the
human body’s methods of thermoregulation. An increase in core body
temperature will stimulate the body to produce sweat. As the body’s
sweat production increases, it causes a drop in body tempe
