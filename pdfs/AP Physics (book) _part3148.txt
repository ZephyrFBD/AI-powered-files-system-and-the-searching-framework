chrödinger’s original wave theory, as did n,

Instead, a subsequent modification by P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1984)
explained its presence as a relativistic effect. The first hint that 
was needed,
however, came from experiment.A careful study of the spectral lines of hydrogen
showed that each actually consisted of two (or more) very closely spaced lines
even in the absence of an external magnetic field. It was at first hypothesized
that this tiny splitting of energy levels, called fine structure, was due to angular
momentum associated with a spinning of the electron. That is, the electron might
spin on its axis as well as orbit the nucleus, just as the Earth spins on its axis
as it orbits the Sun. The interaction between the tiny current of the spinning
electron could then interact with the magnetic field due to the orbiting charge
and cause the small observed splitting of energy levels. (The energy thus depends
slightly on
