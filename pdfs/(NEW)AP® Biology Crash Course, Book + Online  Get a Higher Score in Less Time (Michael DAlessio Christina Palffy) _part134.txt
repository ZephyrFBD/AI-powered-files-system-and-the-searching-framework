ct—a type of genetic drift that places stress on the gene pool due to some type of
disaster, or massive hunting that inhibits a portion of the population from reproducing. The small
population directly contrasts with the large population needed to maintain Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.
3. Founder Effect—a type of genetic drift that occurs when a new colony is formed by a few members of
a population. The smaller sample size narrows the genetic variation of the population. The small
population directly contrasts with the large population needed to maintain Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.
4. Gene Flow—transfer of alleles from one population to another through migration. The gametes of
fertile offspring mix within a population, providing genetic variation. Genetic variation directly
contrasts the no gene flow postulate needed to maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
5. Mutation—a change in the genetic makeup of an organism at the DNA level. Mutation directly
contrasts the no mutation postulate ne
