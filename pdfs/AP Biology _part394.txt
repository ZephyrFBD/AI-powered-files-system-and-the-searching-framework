tes with no internal membranes (no
nucleus, mitochondria, or chloroplasts).
Some are anaerobes; some are aerobes.
Bacteria play a vital role in the ecosystem as decomposers that
recycle dead organic matter.
Many are pathogens, causing disease.
Bacteria play a vital role in genetic engineering. The bacteria from
the human intestine, Escherichia coli, are transformed to
manufacture human insulin.
Some bacteria carry out conjugation, a primitive form of sexual
reproduction where individuals exchange genetic material.
They have a thick, rigid cell wall containing a substance known as
peptidoglycan.
Some carry out photosynthesis, but others do not.
No introns (noncoding regions within the DNA).
Corresponds roughly to the old grouping Eubacteria and includes
blue-green algae, bacteria like E. coli that live in the human
intestine, those that cause disease like Clostridium botulinum and
Streptococcus, and those necessary in the nitrogen cycle, like
nitrogen-fixing bacteria and nitrifying bact
