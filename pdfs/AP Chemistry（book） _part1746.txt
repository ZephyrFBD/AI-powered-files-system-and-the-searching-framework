and ∆Hvap. Thus, ∆Hsub for water is 
approximately 47 kJ>mol.
Phase changes show up in important ways in our everyday experiences. When we 
use ice cubes to cool a drink, for instance, the heat of fusion of the ice cools the liquid. 
We feel cool when we step out of a swimming pool or a warm shower because the liq-
uid water’s heat of vaporization is drawn from our bodies as the water evaporates from 
our skin. Our bodies use this mechanism to regulate body temperature, especially when 
we exercise vigorously in warm weather. 
 (Section 5.5) A refrigerator also relies on 
the cooling effects of vaporization. Its mechanism contains an enclosed gas that can be 
liquefied under pressure. The liquid absorbs heat as it subsequently evaporates, thereby 
cooling the interior of the refrigerator.
What happens to the heat absorbed when the liquid refrigerant vaporizes? Accord-
ing to the first law of thermodynamics 
 (Section 5.2), this absorbed heat must 
be released when the gas condenses to
