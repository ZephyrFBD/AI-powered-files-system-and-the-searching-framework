For example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation. Figure 34.4 illustrates a sea star for
which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill
the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and
