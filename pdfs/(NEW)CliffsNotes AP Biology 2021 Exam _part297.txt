geny of Dd × Dd
would consist of ¾ normal-winged flies.
5. B. At the end of meiosis I, the two homologous chromosomes, one with D and one with d, would separate and
migrate to opposite poles which will form separate cells. During meiosis II, each chromosome separates into two
chromatids (both of which will have exactly the same allele, assuming no crossing over), which migrate to opposite
poles and become separate gametes. Thus, the cell containing the D chromosome will produce two gametes, each
with a D chromosome (previously a chromatid). Similarly, the cell containing the d chromosome will produce two
gametes, both with a d chromosome. At the end of meiosis II, then, there will be two gametes with a D chromosome
and two gametes with a d chromosome.
6. A. Black is the phenotype of the sheep. That is given to you in the question. Without further information, you
cannot identify the genotype of a black sheep because it could be either BB or Bb. The possible genotypes of the
parents of
