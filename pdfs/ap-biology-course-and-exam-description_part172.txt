From Gene to 
Protein—A Historical 
Perspective
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.M
Describe the mechanisms 
by which genetic information 
is copied for transmission 
between generations.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.M.1
DNA replication ensures continuity of 
hereditary information—
a. DNA is synthesized in the 5’ to 3’ direction.
b. Replication is a semiconservative  
process—that is, one strand of DNA 
serves as the template for a new strand 
of complementary DNA.
c. Helicase unwinds the DNA strands.
d. Topoisomerase relaxes supercoiling in front 
of the replication fork. 
e. DNA polymerase requires RNA primers to 
initiate DNA synthesis.
f. DNA polymerase synthesizes new strands of 
DNA continuously on the leading strand and 
discontinuously on the lagging strand.
g. Ligase joins the fragments on the 
lagging strand.
