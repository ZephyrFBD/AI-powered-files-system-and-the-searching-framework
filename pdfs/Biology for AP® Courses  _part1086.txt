ces the making of a
functional protein. Cell-surface receptors bind to
hydrophilic ligands and a ligand-receptor
complex directly enters the nucleus, initiating
transcription and translation.
d.
Internal receptors are integral membrane
proteins that bind to hydrophobic ligands,
initiating a signaling cascade, which indirectly
influences the making of a functional protein.
Cell-surface receptors bind to hydrophilic
ligands and the ligand-receptor complex directly
enters the nucleus, initiating transcription and
translation.
22. Cells grown in the laboratory are mixed with a dye
molecule that is unable to pass through the plasma
membrane. If a ligand is added to the cells, the dye is
observed entering the cells. What type of receptor did the
ligand bind to on the cell surface?
