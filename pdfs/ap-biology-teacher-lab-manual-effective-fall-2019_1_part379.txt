 difference, if any, in the rate of cellular respiration in germinating seeds 
versus nongerminating seeds? 
•  Does the temperature of germinating seeds affect the rate of cellular respiration? Do 
plant seeds consume more oxygen at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures? 
•  Do germinating seeds just starting to germinate consume oxygen at a greater rate 
than seeds that have been germinating for several days (age dependence)? 
•  Do seeds, such as Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds (which store energy as oil), respire at a 
different rate from small grass seeds (which store energy as starch)? 
•  Do small seeds of spring flowers, weeds, or grasses respire at a different rate from 
seeds from summer, fall, or winter plants? 
•  Do seeds from monocot plants respire at different rates from dicot plants? 
•  Do available nutrients affect the rate of respiration in germinating seeds? 
•  Can the same respirometer system be used to measure the rate of respiration in small 
invertebrates,
