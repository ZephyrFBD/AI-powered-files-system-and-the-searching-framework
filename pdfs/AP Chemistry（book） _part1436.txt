ion to the bonding between any 
other two atoms.
 t When atoms share more than one pair of electrons, one pair is used to form a s 
bond; the additional pairs form p bonds. The centers of charge density in a p bond 
lie above and below the internuclear axis.
 t Molecules can have p systems that extend over more than two bonded atoms. Elec-
trons in extended p systems are said to be “delocalized.” We can determine the num-
ber of electrons in the p system of a molecule using the procedures we discussed in 
this section.
Vision begins when light is focused by the lens of the eye onto the 
retina, the layer of cells lining the interior of the eyeball. The retina 
contains photoreceptor cells called rods and cones (Figure 9.28). The 
rods are sensitive to dim light and are used in night vision. The cones 
are sensitive to colors. The tops of the rods and cones contain a mol-
ecule called rhodopsin, which consists of a protein, opsin, bonded to 
a reddish purple pigment called retinal.
