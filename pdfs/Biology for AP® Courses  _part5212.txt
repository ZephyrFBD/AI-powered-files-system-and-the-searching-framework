anufactured crisis … there is no evidence of anyone dying from
[this] illness.’ Dr Tom Cowan and Sally Fallon Morell, authors of The
Contagion Myth, published a statement with Dr Kaufman in
February, 2021, explaining why the ‘virus’ does not exist and you can
read it that in full in the Appendix.
‘Virus’ theory can be traced to the ‘cell theory’ in 1858 of German
physician Rudolf Virchow (1821-1920) who contended that disease
originates from a single cell inﬁltrated by a ‘virus’. Dr Stefan Lanka
said that ﬁndings and insights with respect to the structure, function
and central importance of tissues in the creation of life, which were
already known in 1858, comprehensively refute the cell theory.
Virchow ignored them. We have seen the part later played by John
Enders in the 1950s and Lanka notes that infection theories were
only established as a global dogma through the policies and
eugenics of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany (creation of the same
Sabbatian cult behind the ‘Covid’ hoax)
