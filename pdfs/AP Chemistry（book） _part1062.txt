 yet the chemical 
and physical properties of Ar are much more like those of Ne and Kr than like those of 
Na and Rb. When the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, Ar 
and K appear in their correct places in the table. Moseley’s studies also made it possible 
to identify “holes” in the periodic table, which led to the discovery of new elements.
Give It Some Thought
Looking at the periodic table on the front inside cover, can you find an example 
other than Ar and K where the order of the elements would be different if the 
elements were arranged in order of increasing atomic weight?
7.2 ∣ Effective Nuclear Charge
Many properties of atoms depend on electron configuration and on how strongly the 
outer electrons in the atoms are attracted to the nucleus. Coulomb’s law tells us that 
the strength of the interaction between two electrical charges depends on the magni-
tudes of the charges and on the distance between them. 
 (Section 2.3) Thus, the 
attractive force b
