tical research situation, scientists discover
bacterial endospores in silt at the bottom of a marsh that
has been contaminated with a pollutant for 25 years. The
silt of the marsh was deposited in annual layers. The age
of the endospores can be estimated, then, by identifying
the layer of silt in which the endospores are found. In flask
A, researchers place 20-year-old endospores along with
growth medium and the pollutant. In flask B, researchers
place 100-year-old endospores along with growth medium
and the pollutant. Explain why you would expect to see
more growth in one particular flask than in the other.

a.
Because endospores formed 20 years ago would
be more dormant compared to endospores
formed 100 years ago, before the marsh was
polluted.
b.
Because endospores formed 20 years ago would
be less adapted to polluted conditions compared
to endospores formed 100 years ago, before the
marsh was polluted.
c.
Because endospores formed 2
