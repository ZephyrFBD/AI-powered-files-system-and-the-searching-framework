22.5 | Beneficial Prokaryotes
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What is the need for nitrogen fixation and how is it accomplished?
•
What are examples of foods for which prokaryotes are used in processing?
•
What is bioremediation and how do prokaryotes play a role in this process?
Connection for AP® Courses
We commonly think of pathogens when we think of prokaryotes, focusing on their relationship with disease. However, most
prokaryotes do not cause disease and they play a wide range of other roles in ecosystems. Nitrogen needed to synthesize
proteins and nucleic acids is often the most limiting element in ecosystems and bacteria are able to “fix” nitrogen into
forms that can be used by eukaryotes. Microbes also are used to remove pollutants from environments, a process called
bioremediation. Microbes that call us home are necessary for our survival. They help us digest our food, produce crucial
nutrients
