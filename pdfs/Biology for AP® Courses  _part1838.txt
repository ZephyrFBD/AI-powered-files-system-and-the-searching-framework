 differs
and two ways in which it is similar in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes.
a.
Prokaryotes show co-transcriptional translation
whereas eukaryotes perform transcription prior
to translation; in both cell types, regulation
occurs through the binding of transcription
factors, activators, and repressors.
b.
Prokaryotes perform transcription prior to
translation whereas eukaryotes show co-
transcriptional translation (the processes occur in
the same organelle).
c.
Prokaryotes show co-transcriptional translation
that is regulated prior to translation whereas
eukaryotes perform transcription prior to
translation that is regulated only at the level of
transcription. In both domains, transcription
factors, activators, and repressors provide
regulation.
d.
Prokaryotes show co-transcriptional translation
that occurs in the nucleus whereas eukaryotes
show transcription prior to translation. In both
cell types, regulation occurs using transcription
factors, activators, and repressors.
