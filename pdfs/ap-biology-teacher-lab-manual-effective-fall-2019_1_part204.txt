any other factors that the simulation is trying to model. By starting with a population 
that is modeled on a computer spreadsheet with explicit randomness, students are 
able to build their knowledge toward an inference on allele inheritance patterns in a 
theoretically infinite population. They do this by creating larger and larger populations 
to minimize fluctuations from the expected probabilities.
Having students build their own models (even if extensively guided by the teacher) is 
a requisite component to this investigation. It is during the model building, testing, and 
corrective phase of construction that the reflective and analytical skills of model building 
are learned. These skills, by their very nature, have a broad application to learning.

In this investigation, the students will build a spreadsheet that models how a 
hypothetical gene pool changes from one generation to the next. Th
