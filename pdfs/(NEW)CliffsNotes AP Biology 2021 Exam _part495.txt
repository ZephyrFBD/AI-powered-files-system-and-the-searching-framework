in effect before the far-
red flash. In a series of alternating flashes of red and farred light, only the last flash affects the perception of night
length. Thus, red light shortens the night length, and far-red light restores the night length.
Many flowering plants initiate flowering in response to changes in the photoperiod. Flowering plants can be divided
into three groups, as follows:
1. Long-day plants flower in the spring and early summer when daylight is increasing. These plants flower when
daylight exceeds a critical length (or when nights are less than a critical length).
2. Short-day plants flower in late summer and early fall when daylight is decreasing. These plants flower when
daylight is less than a critical length (or when night exceeds a critical length).
3. Day-neutral plants do not flower in response to daylight changes. Some other cue, such as temperature or water,
triggers flowering.
Many experiments have confirmed that a hormone, called florigen, is produced in lea
