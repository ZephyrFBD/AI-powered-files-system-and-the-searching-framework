ll the
glucose from nascent urine, resulting in glucose being lost in urine. High glucose levels also result in less water being
reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. Over time, high
blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and
cardiovascular system. Oversecretion of insulin can cause hypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels. This causes insufficient
glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness, and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left
untreated.

When blood glucose levels decline below normal levels, for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly
during exercise, the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon raises blood g
