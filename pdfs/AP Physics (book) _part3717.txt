Another way to test the curvature of space is to measure the radius r and
circumference C of a large circle. On a plane surface,
But on a two-
dimensional spherical surface, C is less than 
as can be seen in Fig. 33–17.
The proportionality between C and r is less than 
Such a surface is said to have
positive curvature. On the saddlelike surface of Fig. 33–18, the circumference of a
circle is greater than 
and the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than 180°.
Such a surface is said to have a negative curvature.
Curvature of the Universe
What about our universe? On a large scale (not just near a large mass), what is
the overall curvature of the universe? Does it have positive curvature, negative
curvature, or is it flat (zero curvature)? We perceive our world as Euclidean
(flat), but we can not exclude the possibility that spac
