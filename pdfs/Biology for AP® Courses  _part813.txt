oup is transferred to CoA, producing a molecule of acetyl CoA.
Figure 7.9 Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix, a multi-enzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA. In the
process, carbon dioxide is released and one molecule of NADH is formed.
Note that during the second stage of glucose metabolism, whenever a carbon atom is removed, it is bound to two oxygen
atoms, producing carbon dioxide, one of the major end products of cellular respiration.
Acetyl CoA to CO2
In the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate,
a six-carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from
what began as a glucose molecule. This single pathway is called by different names: the citric acid cycle (for the first
intermediate formed—citric acid, or citrate—when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the TCA cycle (since citric acid or
citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic
