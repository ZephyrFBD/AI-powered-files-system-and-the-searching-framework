bability that both are there is 11>222 = 1>4. If we apply the same 
analysis to three gas molecules, we find that the probability that all three are in the left 
flask at the same time is 11>223 = 1>8.
Now let’s consider a mole of gas. The probability that all the molecules are in the 
left flask at the same time is 11>22N, where N = 6.02 * 1023. This is a vanishingly small 
number! Thus, there is essentially zero likelihood that all the gas molecules will be 
in the left flask at the same time. This analysis of the microscopic behavior of the 
gas molecules leads to the expected macroscopic behavior: The gas spontaneously 
expands to fill both the left and right flasks, and it does not spontaneously all go back 
in the left flask.
This molecular view of gas expansion shows the tendency of the molecules to 
“spread out” among the different arrangements they can take. Before the stopcock is 
opened, there is only one possible arrangement: all molecules in the left flask. When
