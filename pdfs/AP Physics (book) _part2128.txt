nal to the resistance.
The scale calibration depends on the value of its series resistor, which is 
changeable in a multimeter. Because an ohmmeter sends a current through the
device whose resistance is to be measured, it should not be used on very delicate
devices that could be damaged by the current.
Digital Meters
Digital meters (see Fig. 19–30b) are used in the same way as analog meters: they
are inserted directly into the circuit, in series, to measure current (Fig. 19–33b),
and connected “outside,” in parallel with the circuit, to measure voltage (Fig.19–33c).
The internal construction of digital meters is very different from analog
meters. First, digital meters do not use a galvanometer, but rather semiconductor
devices (Chapter 29). The electronic circuitry and digital readout are more 
sensitive than a galvanometer, and have less effect on the circuit to be meas-
ured. When we measure dc voltages, a digital meter’s resistance is very high,
commonly on the order of
