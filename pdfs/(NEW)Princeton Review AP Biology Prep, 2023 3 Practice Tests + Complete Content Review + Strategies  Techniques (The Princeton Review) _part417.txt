im that evolution will occur in this
population?
(A) The situation describes a small population.
(B) Mutations occur in this population.
(C) People do not usually mate randomly.
(D) Natural selection pressures do not exist on this island.
9. Peacock males have evolved to have huge, beautiful tails with numerous large eye spots. Long, colorful tails
are difficult to carry when you are running from a predator. However, peahens (female peacocks) have been
shown by researchers to mate preferably with males with more eye spots and longer tails, despite these traits
making the males more susceptible to predation. Over time, this preference has resulted in peacocks with huge
tails due to
(A) sexual selection
(B) disrupted selection
(C) divergent evolution
(D) sympatric speciation
Summary
Charles Darwin made the following key observations that led to his theory of natural selection:
Each species produces more offspring than can survive.
Offspring compete with each other for limited resources.
