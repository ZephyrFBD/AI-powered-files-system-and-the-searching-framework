se I and Cytokinesis
In telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase events may or may
not occur, depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around
the chromatids in telophase I. In other organisms, cytokinesis—the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into
two daughter cells—occurs without reformation of the nuclei. In nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis
separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division). In plants,
a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. This cell plate will ultimately
lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells.
Two haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division. The cells are haploid because at each pole, there is just
one of each pair of the homologous ch
