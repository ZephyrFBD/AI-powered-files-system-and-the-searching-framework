 are favored in this
case.
d.
This is an eample of directional selection.
Because only the smallest males are mating, the
next generation will have a higher proportion of
alleles for small size, making the seals smaller
over time.
26. Explain why there is no perfect organism despite
natural selection.
a.
Because natural selection works on a geographic
level.
b.
Because natural selection works in a random
manner like mutations.
c.
Because of limitations due to a populationâ€™s
existing variation in genes.
d.
Because natural selection is limited to sexual
dimorphism.
27. A new predator invades the habitat of a population of
field mice. Individuals with larger body size are easier for
the predator to capture then individuals with smaller body
size. Draw a histogram of body sizes with two plot lines,
one showing the former population and another showing
the new population that indicates how this population will
likely evolve. On your histogram, also indicate what type
of natural selection is
