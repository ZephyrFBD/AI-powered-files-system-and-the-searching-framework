rger might take months to break
down suﬀiciently to be useful to you. Thus, although hamburger
breakdown may be spontaneous, the limiting factor in the reaction is the
reaction rate, which is dependent on energy being provided to start this
breakdown. This energy is the activation energy, and enzymes provide a
foundation on which molecules can react so that the energy needed to
start a reaction is not as great as it would have to be without the
enzymes’ presence.
INHIBITION
Cells must regulate enzyme action to keep these rapid reactions under
control. Most enzymes are inactive most of the time, and enzyme
pathways are regulated in complex fashions to ensure eﬀiciency and
safety. Enzymes can be regulated by inhibitors, molecules that bind to
the enzyme either at the active site or the allosteric (regulatory) site.
Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor and the substrate
compete for the active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by
increasing the concentration of subs
