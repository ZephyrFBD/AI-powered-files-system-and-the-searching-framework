other by proteins (predominantly two proteins called claudins and occludins).

adherence. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
This tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells; tight junctions are typically found in epithelial
tissues that line internal organs and cavities, and comprise most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial
cells lining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular space.
Desmosomes
Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 4.30).
Short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes. The
cadherins join two adjacent cells together and maintain the cells in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch,
like the sk
