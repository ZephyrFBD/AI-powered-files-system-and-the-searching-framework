EVO-3.E
Describe the rate of 
evolution and speciation 
under different ecological 
conditions.
EVO-3.E.1
Punctuated equilibrium is when evolution 
occurs rapidly after a long period of stasis. 
Gradualism is when evolution occurs slowly 
over hundreds of thousands or millions 
of years.
EVO-3.E.2
Divergent evolution occurs when adaptation 
to new habitats results in phenotypic 
diversification. Speciation rates can be 
especially rapid during times of adaptive 
radiation as new habitats become available.
