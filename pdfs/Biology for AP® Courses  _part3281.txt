42. Explain what can be inferred about the relative sizes of
the areas of cortex that process signals from skin not
densely innervated with sensory receptors versus skin that
is densely innervated with sensory receptors.
a.
Areas of the cortex that process signals from
skin with fewer sensory receptors are likely to be
larger than those having large numbers of
sensory receptors.
b.
Areas of the cortex that process signals from
skin with fewer sensory receptors are likely to be
smaller than those having large numbers of
sensory receptors.
c.
Areas of the cortex that process signals from
skin with fewer sensory receptors and large
numbers of sensory receptors will likely be the
same.
d.
There is no relationship between the relative
sizes of areas of cortex that process signals from
skin and the sensory receptor numbers.
43. Explain why some people think that peppers are
painful or hot, while othe
