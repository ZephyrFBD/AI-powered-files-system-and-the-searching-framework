th a ruler and compared to the scale. Angles can be measured 
with a protractor. This method is known as the tail-to-tip method of adding 
vectors.
The resultant is not affected by the order in which the vectors are added.
For example, a displacement of 5.0 km north, to which is added a displacement
of 10.0 km east, yields a resultant of 11.2 km and angle
(see Fig. 3–4),
the same as when they were added in reverse order (Fig. 3–3). That is, now
using

[Mathematicians call this equation the commutative property of vector addition.]
