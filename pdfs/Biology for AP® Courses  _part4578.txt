Yellow buntings are birds that feed on butterflies,
including Aglaisurticae, a species of butterfly that has
bright circular coloring on its wing called an eyespot.
Biologists have hypothesized that eyespots mimic owl
eyes. Owls are predators of yellow buntings.
In laboratory experiments using yellow buntings captured
from the wild and held in captivity, individual birds were
observed during sessions in which they were given
butterflies that had either not be treated or had been treated
to remove their eyespots. Yellow buntings were scored
according to whether they showed fleeing behavior when
they encountered butterflies of both types. The data were
compiled into a table. How do these data support the claim
that one speciesâ€™ response to information can affect natural
selection in another species?
a.
Comparison of the total number of encounters
shows that more birds responded to the eyespot,
a trait that will likely be selected against in
natural populati
