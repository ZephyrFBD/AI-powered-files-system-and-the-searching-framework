ins a meal at 7:00 and finishes at 7:15, according to
a clock on the train. The two events, beginning and ending the meal, take place at
the same point on the train, so the “proper time” between these two events is 
15 min. To observers on Earth, the plate is moving and the meal will take
longer—20 min according to Eqs. 26–1. Let us assume that the meal was served
on a 20-cm-diameter plate (its “proper length”). To observers on the Earth, the
plate is moving and is only 15 cm wide (length contraction). Thus, to observers on
the Earth, the meal looks smaller but lasts longer.
500 m - 80 m = 420 m
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 26;7
In a sense the two effects, time dilation and length contraction, balance each
other. When viewed from the Earth, what an object seems to lose in size it gains
in length of time it lasts. Space, or length, is exchanged for time.
Considerations like this led to the idea of four-dimensional space–time:
space takes up three dimensions and time is a fourth dimension. Space a
