(D) is the correct answer.
16. B
Humans receive approximately half of their DNA, or one chromosome out of each homologous pair, from each
parent. Siblings also share approximately half of their DNA with their siblings, so eliminate (B). Fraternal
twins are the same as siblings who happen to be born at the same time, so eliminate (C). Since parents only
received 50% of their DNA from the grandparents, humans only share 25% of their DNA with each of their
grandparents.
17. C
A transformation is the uptake of DNA by a bacterium. DNA uptake by a virus, (A), would be a transduction,
although this requires a virus to gain the DNA via infection of a bacterium.
18. B
Some mutations are harmful and decrease the productive success of the individual, so (B) is correct. Dominant
alleles would make mutations seem more frequent, as would neutral phenotypic changes, so eliminate (A) and
(C). Mutations produce variability in a gene pool. Any gene is bound to mutate. This produces a constant inpu
