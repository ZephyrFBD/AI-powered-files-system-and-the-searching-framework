short period in order to provide vaccinations to key
populations at the optimal time.
Because viruses, like the flu, evolve very quickly (especially in evolutionary time), this poses quite a
challenge. Viruses mutate and replicate at a fast rate, so the vaccine developed to protect against last year’s
flu strain may not provide the protection needed against the coming year’s strain. Evolution of these viruses
means continued adaptions to ensure survival, including adaptations to survive previous vaccines.
Population genetics is the study of what?
a.
How selective forces change the allele frequencies in a population over time.
b.
The genetic basis of genetic traits within individuals.
c.
Whether traits have a genetic basis.
d.
The degree of inbreeding in a population.
Population Genetics
Recall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or variants, that code for different traits associated
with that character. For example, in the ABO blood type system in humans, t
