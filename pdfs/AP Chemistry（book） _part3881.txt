between the a and b forms might seem small, it has enormous biological consequences, 
including the vast difference in properties between starch and cellulose.
Fructose can cyclize to form either five- or six-member rings. The five-member ring 
forms when the C5 OH group reacts with the C2 carbonyl group:

The six-member ring results from the reaction between the C6 OH group and the C2 
carbonyl group.
How many chiral carbon atoms are there in the open-chain form of glucose (Figure 24.19)?
Solve Carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5 each have four 
different groups attached to them:
