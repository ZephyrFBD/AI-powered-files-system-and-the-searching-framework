d” reactions,
Eqs. 31–8a and b in equal amounts. Estimate how much
natural water, for fuel, would be needed per hour to run a
1150-MW reactor, assuming 33% efficiency.
36. (III) Show that the energies carried off by the 
nucleus
and the neutron for the reaction of Eq. 31–8c are about
3.5 MeV and 14 MeV, respectively. Are these fixed values,
independent of the plasma temperature?
37. (III) How much energy (J) is contained in 1.00 kg of water
if its natural deuterium is used in the fusion reaction of
Eq. 31–8a? Compare to the energy obtained from the burn-
ing of 1.0 kg of gasoline, about 
38. (III) (a) Give the ratio of the energy needed for the first
reaction of the carbon cycle to the energy needed for a
deuterium–tritium reaction (Example 31–9). (b) If a
deuterium–tritium reaction actually requires a temperature
estimate the temperature needed for the
first carbon-cycle reaction.
