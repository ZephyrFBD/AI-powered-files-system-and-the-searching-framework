allele frequencies change in 
a population over one generation? As you work, think about the following more specific 
questions: 
•  What can you change in your model? If you change something, what does the change 
tell you about how alleles behave? 
•  Do alleles behave the same way if you make a particular variable more extreme? Less 
extreme? 
•  Do alleles behave the same way no matter what the population size is? To answer this 
question, you can insert rows of data somewhere between the first row of data and 
the last row and then copy the formulas down to fill in the space. 
Try out different starting allele frequencies in the model. Look for and describe the 
patterns that you find as you try out different allele frequencies. Develop and use a 
pattern to select your values to test and organize your exploration. In particular, test 
your model with extreme values and intermediate values. In your lab notebook, describe 
your observations and conclusions about the population inhe
