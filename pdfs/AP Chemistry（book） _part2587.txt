gets smaller), 
so that the product Ka * Kb remains 1.0 * 10-14 at 25 °C. Table 16.5 demonstrates this 
relationship.
By using Equation 16.40, we can calculate Kb for any weak base if we know Ka for its 
conjugate acid. Similarly, we can calculate Ka for a weak acid if we know Kb for its conju-
gate base. As a practical consequence, ionization constants are often listed for only one 
member of a conjugate acid–base pair. For example, Appendix D does not contain Kb val-
ues for the anions of weak acids because they can be readily calculated from the tabu-
lated Ka values for their conjugate acids.
Recall that we often express 3H+4 as pH: pH = -log 3H+4. 
 (Section 16.4) This “p” 
nomenclature is often used for other very small numbers. For example, if you look up the 
values for acid- or base-dissociation constants in a chemistry handbook, you may find 
them expressed as pKa or pKb:
 
pKa = -log Ka  and  pKb = -log Kb 
[16.41]
Using this nomenclature, we can write Equation 16.40 in term
