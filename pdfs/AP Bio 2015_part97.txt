 = frequency of the dominant allele 
in a population 
q = frequency of the recessive allele 
in a population

 2pq + q2 = 1 
Chi-Square Table
Standard Error of the Mean
 
 
Chi-Square 
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 
If A and B are independent, then:

pH = – log10 [H+] 
T2 = higher temperature 
T1 = lower temperature 
k2 = reaction rate at T2 
k1 = reaction rate at T1 
Q10 = the factor by which the 
reaction rate increases when 
the temperature is raised by 
ten degrees 
Dilution (used to create a dilute solution from a 
concentrated stock solution) 
CiVi = CfVf 
 
i = initial (starting) 
f = final   (desired) 
C = concentration of solute 
V = volume of solution
