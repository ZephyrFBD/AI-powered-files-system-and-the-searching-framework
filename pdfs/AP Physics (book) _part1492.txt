Temperature and Kinetic Theory
63. (II) What is the mass of water in a closed room
when the temperature is 25°C and
the relative humidity is 55%?
64. (II) A pressure cooker is a sealed pot designed to cook food
with the steam produced by boiling water somewhat above
100°C. The pressure cooker in Fig. 13–32 uses a weight of
mass m to allow steam to escape at a certain pressure through
a small hole (diameter d) in the cooker’s lid. If
what should m be in
order to cook food at
120°C? Assume that
atmospheric pressure
outside the cooker is
65. (II) If the humidity in a sealed room of volume 
at
20°C is 65%, what mass o
