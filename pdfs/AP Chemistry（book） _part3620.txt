ed in sulfuric acid.
 22.48  Write a balanced equation for each of the following reactions. 
(You may have to guess at one or more of the reaction prod-
ucts, but you should be able to make a reasonable guess, based 
on your study of this chapter.) (a) Hydrogen selenide can be 
prepared by reaction of an aqueous acid solution on alumi-
num selenide. (b) Sodium thiosulfate is used to remove excess 
Cl2 from chlorine-bleached fabrics. The thiosulfate ion forms 
SO4
2 - and elemental sulfur, while Cl2 is reduced to Cl -.
