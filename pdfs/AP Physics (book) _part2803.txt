eyepiece and therefore is refracted through the eyepiece
focal point 
on the far side. Thus,
and the total magnifying power
(that is, angular magnification, which is what is always quoted) of this telescope is
(25;3)
where we used Eq. 23–1 and we inserted a minus sign to indicate that the image is
inverted. To achieve a large magnification, the objective lens should have a long
focal length and the eyepiece a short focal length.
Telescope magnification. The largest optical refracting
telescope in the world is located at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin,
Fig. 25–21. It is referred to as a “40-inch” telescope, meaning that the diameter of
the objective is 40 in., or 102 cm. The objective lens has a focal length of 19 m,
and the eyepiece has a focal length of 10 cm. (a) Calculate the total magnifying
power of this telescope. (b) Estimate the length of the telescope.
APPROACH Equation 25–3 gives the magnification. The length of the telescope
is the distance between the two lenses.
