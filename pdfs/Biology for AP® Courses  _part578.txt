The higher temperature of right beaker causes slower diffusion of yellow dye in the right beaker.
Tonicity in Living Systems
In a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. In an isotonic condition, the relative concentrations of
solute and solvent are equal on both sides of the membrane. There is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change
in the size of the cell. In a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. If either the hypo- or hyper- condition
goes to excess, the cell’s functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed.

A red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membrane’s capability to expand. Remember, the
membrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules composing it. If the ce
