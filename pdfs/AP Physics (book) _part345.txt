it is zero. Thus 
does not work in such an accelerating reference frame
(
but
in this noninertial frame).
EXERCISE A Suppose you watch a cup slide on the (smooth) dashboard of an acceler-
ating car as we just discussed, but this time from an inertial reference frame outside the
car, on the street. From your inertial frame, Newton’s laws are valid. What force pushes
the cup off the dashboard?

4–5 Newton’s Third Law of Motion
Newton’s second law of motion describes quantitatively how forces affect motion.
But where, we may ask, do forces come from? Observations suggest that a force
exerted on any object is always exerted by another object. A horse pulls a wagon,
a person pushes a grocery cart
