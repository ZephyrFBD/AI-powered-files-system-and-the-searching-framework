from rest and rolls without slipping down a 30.0°
incline that is 10.0 m long. (a) Calculate its translational
and rotational speeds when it reaches the bottom. (b) What
is the ratio of translational to rotational kinetic energy at
the bottom? Avoid putting in numbers until the end so you
can answer: (c) do your answers in (a) and (b) depend on
the radius of the sphere or its mass?

The pulley is a uniform cylinder of radius 
and mass 3.1 kg. Initially 
is on
the ground and 
rests 2.5 m
above the ground. If the system 
is released, use conservation of
energy to determine the speed 
of 
just before it strikes the
ground. Assume the pulley bearing
is frictionless.
