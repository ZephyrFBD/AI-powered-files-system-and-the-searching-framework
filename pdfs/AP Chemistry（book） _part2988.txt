 19.1 ▶  Spontaneous Processes Note 
that changes that occur in nature have 
a directional character. They move 
spontaneously in one direction but not in 
the reverse direction.
 19.2 ▶  Entropy and the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics Learn that 
entropy is a thermodynamic state function 
important in determining whether a 
process is spontaneous. The second law 
of thermodynamics tells us that in any 
spontaneous process, the entropy of 
the universe (system plus surroundings) 
increases.
 19.3 ▶  The Molecular Interpretation  
of Entropy and the Third Law  
of Thermodynamics On the molecular 
level, consider that the entropy of a system 
is related to the number of accessible 
microstates. The entropy of the system 
increases as the randomness of the system 
increases. The third law of thermodynamics 
states that, at 0 K, the entropy of a perfect 
crystalline solid is zero.
