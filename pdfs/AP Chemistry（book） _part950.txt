 in Figure 6.22 shows 
that the function generally gets smaller the farther we go from the 
nucleus. But when we multiply by 4pr2, we see peaks that get larger 
and larger (up to a certain point) as we move away from the nucleus 
 
( Figure 6.19).

The radial probability functions in Figure 6.19 provide us with 
the more use ful information because they tell us the probability of 
ﬁnding the electron at all points a distance r from the nucleus, not 
just one particular point
