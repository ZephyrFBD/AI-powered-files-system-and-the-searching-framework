ts to transpire, releasing water vapor into the atmosphere. In the
atmosphere, the water vapor cools and condenses into clouds and
precipitation. Precipitation returns water to the Earth’s surface, where it
runs oﬀ into lakes and rivers and percolates into groundwater.
There is more nitrogen in the air than oxygen: nitrogen gas makes up over
two-thirds of Earth’s air. However, most living things cannot get the
nitrogen they need from nitrogen gas. Certain groups of bacteria in the
soil, called nitrogen-fixing bacteria, convert nitrogen gas into nitrates and
nitrites; plants then take up the nitrites and nitrates from the soil and
from fertilizers. Animals, including humans, get nitrogen by eating plants
and other living or dead organic matter. When animals and plants die,
groups of bacteria and fungi break down these organic remains and
release nitrogen back into the soil. Animal waste contains nitrogen as
well. Denitrifying bacteria in the soil then change the nitrates and nitrites
