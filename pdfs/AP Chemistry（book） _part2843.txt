and FeCO3. Assume that the water is slightly basic and 
that the hydrolysis of the carbonate ion can therefore be 
ignored.
 17.105  The solubility product constants of PbSO4 and SrSO4 are 
6.3 * 10-7 and 3.2 * 10-7, respectively. What are the val-
ues of 3SO4
2 -4, 3Pb2 +4, and 3Sr2 +4 in a solution at equilib-
rium with both substances?
 17.106  A buffer of what pH is needed to give a Mg2 +  concentra-
tion of 3.0 * 10-2 M in equilibrium with solid magnesium 
oxalate?
 17.107  The value of Ksp for Mg31AsO422 is 2.1 * 10-20. The 
AsO4
3 -  ion is derived from the weak acid H3AsO4 1pKa1 =
2.22; pKa2 = 6.98; pKa3 = 11.502. (a) Calculate the molar 
solubility of Mg31AsO422 in water. (b) Calculate the pH of a 
saturated solution of Mg31AsO422 in water.
 17.108  The solubility product for Zn1OH22 is 3.0 * 10-16. The for-
mation constant for the hydroxo complex, Zn1OH24
2 -, is 
4.6 * 1017. What co
