n air (20°C) as it reaches our ears is
(a) same frequency, same wavelength.
(b) higher frequency, same wavelength.
(c) lower frequency, same wavelength.
(d) same frequency, longer wavelength.
(e) same frequency, shorter wavelength.
9. A guitar player shortens the length of a guitar’s vibrating
string by pressing the string straight down onto a fret. The
guitar then emits a higher-pitched note, because
(a) the string’s tension has been dramatically increased.
(b) the string can vibrate with a much larger amplitude.
(c) the string vibrates at a higher frequency.
10. An organ pipe with a fundamental frequency f is open at
both ends. If one end is closed off, the fundamental fre-
quency will
(a) drop by half.
(b) not change.
(c) double.
11. Two loudspeakers are about 10 m apart in the front of a large
classroom. If either speaker plays a pure tone at a single
frequency of 400 Hz, the loudness seems pretty even as you
wander around the room, and gradually decreases in volume
as you move far
