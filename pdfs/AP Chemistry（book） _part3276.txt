A large amount of electrical energy is needed in the Hall–Héroult 
process, with the result that the aluminum industry consumes about 
2% of the electrical energy generated in the United States. Because 
recycled aluminum requires only 5% of the energy needed to pro-
duce “new” aluminum, considerable energy savings can be realized 
by increasing the amount of aluminum recycled. Approximately 65% 
of aluminum beverage containers are recycled in the United States.

▲ Figure 20.32 The Hall–Héroult process. Because molten 
aluminum is denser than the mixture of cryolite 1Na3AlF62 and 
Al2O3, the metal collects at the bottom of the cell.
