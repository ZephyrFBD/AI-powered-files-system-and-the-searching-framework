elium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth
muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). The elastic connective tissue stretches
and supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance
through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to
accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate
of flow are much lower. In addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the
backflow of blood. Because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle
assists with the flow of blood back to the heart.
