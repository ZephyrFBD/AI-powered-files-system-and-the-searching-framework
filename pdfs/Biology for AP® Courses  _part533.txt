ponents identified at that time were lipids and proteins. The first widely accepted model of the
plasma membrane’s structure was proposed in 1935 by Hugh Davson and James Danielli; it was based on the “railroad
track” appearance of the plasma membrane in early electron micrographs. They theorized that the structure of the plasma
membrane resembles a sandwich, with protein being analogous to the bread, and lipids being analogous to the filling. In
the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably transmission electron microscopy (TEM), allowed researchers to see that the
core of the plasma membrane consisted of a double, rather than a single, layer. A new model that better explains both the
microscopic observations and the function of that plasma membrane was proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson in
1972.
The explanation proposed by Singer and Nicolson is called the fluid mosaic model. The model has evolved somewhat over
time, but it still best accounts for the structure and functions
