encode RNA interference (RNAi) proteins for
the regulation of levels of mRNA transcription.
Some viral RNA is double stranded (dsRNA). A cell
responds to the presence of double-stranded RNA by the
attachment of the enzyme DICER, which cuts dsRNA into
short fragments. One strand of the fragment is transferred
to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
searches for an mRNA with a sequence matching that of
the fragment strand. When detected, this mRNA is
degraded.
A. Common in cancer cells is a mutation of the gene that
encodes the protein p53, whose role is to detect and repair
errors in DNA; if repairs cannot be made, p53 initiates
apoptosis. Create a visual representation to explain how
the DICER-RISC system within the cell can be used to
suppress the translation of a mutated form of the gene
encoding p53, potentially destroying a tumor.
B. Whole-genome sequences provide a library of
potentially expressed proteins, but they do not provide
information on the functions of each pr
