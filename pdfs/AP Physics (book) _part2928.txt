ment (Fig.26–7). There are
more than 30 global positioning system satellites that send out precise time signals
using atomic clocks. Your receiver compares the times received from at least four
satellites, all of whose times are carefully synchronized to within 1 part in 
By comparing the time differences with the known satellite positions and the
fixed speed of light, the receiver can determine how far it is from each satellite
and thus where it is on the Earth. It can do this to an accuracy of a few meters, if
it has been constructed to make corrections such as the one below due to relativity.

Show that a good GPS receiver
needs to correct for time dilation if it is to produce results consistent with atomic
clocks accurate to 1 part in 
RESPONSE Let us calculate the magnitude of the time dilation effect by
inserting
into Eq. 26–1a:
We use the binomial expansion:

which here is 
That is
The time “error
