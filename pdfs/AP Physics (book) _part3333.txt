For a particular type of atom (say, carbon), nuclei are found to contain dif-
ferent numbers of neutrons, although they all have the same number of protons.
For example, carbon nuclei always have 6 protons, but they may have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
or 10 neutrons. Nuclei that contain the same number of protons but different
numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Thus,
and 
are all isotopes of carbon. The isotopes of a given element are not all equally
common. For example, 98.9% of naturally occurring carbon (on Earth) is the
isotope 
and about 1.1% is 
These percentages are referred to as the
natural abundances.† Even hydrogen has isotopes: 99.99% of natural hydrogen 
is 
a simple proton, as the nucleus; there are also 
called deuterium,
and
tritium, which besides the proton contain 1 or 2 neutrons. (The bare
nucleus in each case is called the deuteron and triton.)
