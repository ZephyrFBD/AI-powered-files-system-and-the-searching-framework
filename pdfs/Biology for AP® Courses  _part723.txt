the enzymeâ€™s active site(s) for its substrate(s).
Figure 6.18 Allosteric inhibitors modify the active site of the enzyme so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented.
In contrast, allosteric activators modify the active site of the enzyme so that the affinity for the substrate increases.

Drug Discovery by Looking for Inhibitors of Key Enzymes in
Specific Pathways
Enzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and how they can
be regulated is a key principle behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs (Figure 6.19)
on the market today. Biologists working in t
