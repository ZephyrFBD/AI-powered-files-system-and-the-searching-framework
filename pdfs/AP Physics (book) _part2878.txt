me conditions, what exposure time would be needed
for a pinhole camera (Problem 64) if the pinhole diameter is
1.0 mm and the film is 7.0 cm from the hole?
66. An astronomical telescope has a magnification of 
If
the two lenses are 28 cm apart, determine the focal length
of each lens.
67. (a) How far away can a human eye distinguish two car
headlights 2.0 m apart? Consider only diffraction effects and
assume an eye pupil diameter of 6.0 mm and a wavelength
of 560 nm. (b) What is the minimum angular separation an
eye could resolve when viewing two stars, considering only
diffraction effects? In reality, it is about 
of arc. Why is it
not equal to your answer in (b)?
68. Figure 25–48 was taken from the NIST Laboratory (National
Institute of Standards and Technology) in Boulder, CO,
2.0 km from the hiker in the photo. The Sun’s image was
15 mm across on the film. Estimate the focal length of the
camera lens (actually a telescope). The Sun has diameter
and it is 
away.
