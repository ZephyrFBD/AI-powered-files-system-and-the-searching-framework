rease as 
but
continue acting over any distances and are therefore called long-range forces.
The strong nuclear force has some strange features. For example, if a nuclide
contains too many or too few neutrons relative to the number of protons, the
binding of the nucleons is reduced; nuclides that are too unbalanced in this
regard are unstable. As shown in Fig. 30–2, stable nuclei tend to have the same
number of protons as neutrons 
up to about 
. Beyond this,
stable nuclei contain more neutrons than protons. This makes sense since, as Z
increases, the electrical repulsion increases, so a greater number of neutrons—
which exert only the attractive strong nuclear force—are required to maintain
stability. For very large Z, no number of neutrons can overcome the greatly
increased electric repulsion. Indeed, there are no completely stable nuclides
above
What we mean by a stable nucleus is one that stays together indefinitely. What
then is an unstable nucleus? It is one that comes apart; and
