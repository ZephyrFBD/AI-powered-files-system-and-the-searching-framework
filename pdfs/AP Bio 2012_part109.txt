s of this experiment. The focus of 
this experiment is the consumption of oxygen during aerobic cellular respiration, 
not the production of oxygen gas during photosynthesis.
(C)
This option is incorrect because a glucose reserve would have no effect on the 
measurement of oxygen gas consumption because the oxidation of glucose via 
aerobic cellular respiration would still consume oxygen gas at the same rate as 
carbon dioxide production.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the release of excess water would have no effect 
on the relative volumes of oxygen or carbon dioxide gas. There would not be 
enough water produced in this experiment to affect gas volume due to differences 
in solubility.
