 15.59 Methane, CH4, reacts with I2 according to the reaction 
CH41g2 + I21g2 ∆ CH3I1g2 + HI1g2. At 630 K, Kp for 
this reaction is 2.26 * 10-4. A reaction was set up at 630 K 
 
with initial partial pressures of methane of 105.1 torr and 
of 7.96 torr for I2. Calculate the pressures, in torr, of all 
reactants and products at equilibrium.
 15.60 The reaction of an organic acid with an alcohol, in 
organic solvent, to produce an ester and water is com-
monly done in the pharmaceutical industry. This reac-
tion is catalyzed by strong acid (usually H2SO4). A simple 
example is the reaction of acetic acid with ethyl alcohol 
to produce ethyl acetate and water:
CH3COOH1solv2 + CH3CH2OH1solv2 ∆
CH3COOCH2CH31solv2 + H2O1solv2
where “(solv)” indicates that all reactants and products are 
in solution but not an aqueous solution. The equilibrium 
constant for this reaction at 55 °C is 6.68. A pharmaceuti-
cal chemist make
