mixture behaves independently, we can relate the amount of a 
given gas in a mixture to its partial pressure. For an ideal gas, we can write

The ratio n1>nt is called the mole fraction of gas 1, which we denote X1. The mole frac-
tion, X, is a dimensionless number that expresses the ratio of the number of moles of 
one component in a mixture to the total number of moles in the mixture. Thus, for gas 1 
we have
 
X1 =

The mole fraction of N2 in air is 0.78—that is, 78% of the molecules in air are N2. This 
means that if the barometric pressure is 760 torr, the partial pressure of N2 is
P
N2 = 10.7821760 torr2 = 590 torr
This result makes intuitive sense: Because N2 makes up 78% of the mixture, it contributes 
78% of the total pressure.
