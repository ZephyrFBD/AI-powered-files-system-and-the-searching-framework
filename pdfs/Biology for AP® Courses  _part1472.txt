19. Drosophila that are true breeding for the traits straight
wings (S) and red eyes (R) are crossed with flies that are
true breeding for curved wings (s) and brown eyes (r). A
test cross is then made between the offspring and the true-
breeding ssrr flies.
A.
Use the symbols S, s, R, and r to construct a
representation of the parental genotypes in the
test cross.
B.
If these genes are located on different
chromosomes, use a Punnett square to construct
a representation of the offspring of the test
cross.
C.
Predict the distribution of genotypes and
phenotypes resulting from the test cross.
D.
As it happens, these genes are both on
chromosome II as shown below. Use the
symbols S, s, R, and r to construct a
representation of the parental and recombinant
genotypes in the test cross.
E.
Suppose that 500 flies are produced in the test
cross. Apply mathematical methods to
calculate the expected number of recombinant
offspring using th
