 his laboratory. In about a year’s time, he 
developed an electrolytic procedure using an ionic compound that 
melts to form a conducting medium that dissolves Al2O3 but does 
not interfere with the electrolysis reactions. The ionic compound he 
selected was the relatively rare mineral cryolite 1Na3AlF62. Héroult, 
who was the same age as Hall, independently made the same

discovery in France at about the same time. Because of the research 
of these two unknown young scientists, large-scale production of 
aluminum became commercially feasible, and aluminum became 
a common and familiar metal. Indeed, the factory that Hall subse-
quently built to produce aluminum evolved into Alcoa Corporation.
In the Hall–Héroult process, Al2O3 is dissolved in molten cryo-
lite, which melts at 1012 °C and is an effective electrical conductor 
(Figure 20.32). Grap
