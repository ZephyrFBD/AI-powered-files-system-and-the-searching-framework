he oxidation steps of the citric acid cycle also do not occur. Note that the citric acid cycle produces very
little ATP directly and does not directly consume oxygen.

Figure 7.10 In the citric acid cycle, the acetyl group from acetyl CoA is attached to a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule
to form a six-carbon citrate molecule. Through a series of steps, citrate is oxidized, releasing two carbon dioxide
molecules for each acetyl group fed into the cycle. In the process, three NAD+ molecules are reduced to NADH, one
FAD molecule is reduced to FADH2, and one ATP or GTP (depending on the cell type) is produced (by substrate-level
phosphorylation). Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant, the cycle runs continuously
in the presence of sufficient reactants. (credit: modification of work by “Yikrazuul”/Wikimedia Commons)
