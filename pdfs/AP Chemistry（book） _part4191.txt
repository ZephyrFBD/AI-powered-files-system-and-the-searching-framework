. Therefore, to sublime water 
we need to be below 0.006 atm. A wide range of temperatures will 
work for sublimation at this pressure—the most environmentally 
relevant ones are -50 °C to 0 °C. page 788 Nitrogen and phos-
phorous. page 793 With a catalyst, the reaction is always faster, 
therefore costing less energy to run. In addition, with a catalyst the 
reaction may occur readily at a lower temperature, also costing less 
energy. page 795 Because the by-products of the reaction can be 
used to synthesize additional reactants in principle no atoms are 
wasted.  page 796 sp before reaction; sp2 after reaction.

page 810 No. Just because the system is restored to its original 
condition doesn’t mean that the surroundings have likewise been 
restored to their original condition, so it is not necessarily revers-
ible. page 812 ∆S depends not merely on q but on qrev. Although 
there are many possible paths that could take a system from its  
initial to final state, there is a
