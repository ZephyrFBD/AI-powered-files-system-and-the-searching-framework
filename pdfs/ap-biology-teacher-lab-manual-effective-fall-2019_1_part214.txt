environment, guidance, and a problem 
designed to help students understand and develop the skill of modeling biological 
phenomena with computers. There are dozens of computer models already built and 
freely available. The idea of this laboratory is for students to experience the benefits of 
building their own model from scratch. To gain the maximum benefit from this exercise, 
students should not do too much background preparation. By building and exploring 
their own models, students should develop a more thorough understanding of how 
genes behave in populations.  
Many classroom investigations of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium involve simulated 
populations, such as M&M candies or beans. Students can model gene inheritance in a 
simulated population and apply the H-W equation. While all models are simplifications 
and approximations, these particular models are generally based on such small 
populations that students often develop misconceptions regarding H-W equilibrium.
