nergy of Formation
Recall that we defined standard enthalpies of formation, ∆H°
f, as the enthalpy change when a 
substance is formed from its elements under defined standard conditions. 
 (Section 5.7) 
We can define standard free energies of formation, ∆Gf°, in a similar way: ∆Gf° for a 
substance is the free-energy change for its formation from its elements under standard con-
ditions. As is summarized in Table 19.2, standard state means 1 atm pressure for gases, the 
pure solid for solids, and the pure liquid for liquids. For substances in solution, the standard 
state is normally a concentration of 1 M. (In very accurate work it may be necessary to make 
certain corrections, but we need not worry about these.)
The temperature usually chosen for purposes of tabulating data is 25 °C, but we will 
calculate ∆G at other temperatures as well. Just as for the standard heats of formation, 
the free energies of elements in their standard states are set to zero. This arbitrary choice
