Question 2
a. Meiosis consists of two groups of divisions: meiosis I and II. In prophase I, the nuclear membrane breaks down,
the nucleolus disappears, and chromatin condenses into chromosomes. The MTOCs (which contain centrioles in
animals) migrate to opposite poles, developing microtubules and the spindle apparatus between them. Synapsis
occurs when homologous c
