 down
the electron transport chain into Photosystem I.
c.
ATP synthase “de-excites” the electron as it
moves down the electron transport chain into
Photosystem I.
d.
RuBisCO excites the electron as it moves down
the electron transport chain into Photosystem II.
43. Discuss how membranes in chloroplasts contribute to
the organelles’ essential functions.
a.
The inner membrane contains the chemicals
needed for the Calvin cycle and also components
of the light dependent reactions. The thylakoid
membrane contains photosystems I and II, as
well as the enzyme NAD+ reductase.
b.
The inner membrane contains only the chemicals
needed for the Calvin cycle. The thylakoid
membrane contains components of the light
dependent reactions, photosystems I and II, and
the enzyme NAD+ reductase.
c.
The inner membrane contains components of the
light dependent reactions as well as
photosystems I and II. The thylakoid membrane
contains the chemicals needed for the Calvin
cycle and also the enzyme NAD+ reducta
