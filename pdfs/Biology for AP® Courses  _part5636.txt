 of information operating within the overall ‘Wi-Fi’
ﬁeld that I call The Field. A vibrational disturbance is generated in
The Field by the ﬁelds of the falling tree or building. These
disturbance waves are what we decode into the sound of them
falling. If no one is there to do that then neither will make any noise.
Reality is created by the observer – decoder – and the perceptions of
the observer aﬀect the decoding process. For this reason diﬀerent
people – diﬀerent perceptions – will perceive the same reality or
situation in a diﬀerent way. What one may perceive as a nightmare
another will see as an opportunity. The question of why the Cult is
so focused on controlling human perception now answers itself. All
experienced reality is the act of decoding and we don’t experience
Wi-Fi until it is decoded on the computer screen. The sight and
sound of an Internet video is encoded in the Wi-Fi all around us, but
we don’t see or hear it until the computer decodes that information.
