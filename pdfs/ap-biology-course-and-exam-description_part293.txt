icting the percentage 
change in the mass of potato cores after exposure 
to different concentrations of sucrose, the student 
should be able to estimate the concentration of sucrose 
within the potato core. Students should also assess 
the validity of experimental evidence. Using the same 
example, if given hypothetical data showing that potato 
cores increase in mass when placed in solutions with 
lower water potential (a hypertonic solution), they 
should explain why the data (evidence) are likely invalid: 
Since potatoes contain sucrose, they should increase 
in mass only when placed in solutions with higher water 
potential (a hypotonic solution).
