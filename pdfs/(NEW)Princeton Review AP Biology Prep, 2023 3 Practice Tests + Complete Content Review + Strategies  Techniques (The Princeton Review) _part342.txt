ke several proteins.
This is called a polycistronic transcript. Eukaryotes tend to have one gene that gets transcribed to one mRNA and
translated into one protein. Our transcripts are monocistronic.
Transcription involves three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. As in DNA replication, the first
initiation step in transcription is to unwind and unzip the DNA strands using helicase. Transcription begins at special
sequences of the DNA strand called promoters. You can think of a promoter as a docking site or a runway. We will
talk about how promoters are involved in regulating transcription later in the chapter.
Because RNA is single-stranded, we have to copy only one of the two DNA strands. The strand that serves as the
template is known as the antisense strand, the non-coding strand, minus-strand, or the template strand. The
other strand that lies dormant is the sense strand, or the coding strand.
Just as DNA polymerase builds DNA, RNA polymerase builds RNA, and just like
