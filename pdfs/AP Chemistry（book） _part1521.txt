 double or 
triple bond as a single electron domain. Why is this justified?
 9.86  An AB3 molecule is described as having a trigonal-bipyramidal 
electron-domain geometry. (a) How many nonbond-
ing domains are on atom A? (b) Based on the information 
given, which of the following is the molecular geometry of 
the molecule: (i) trigonal planar, (ii) trigonal pyramidal, 
(iii) T-shaped, or (iv) tetrahedral?
 9.87 Consider the following XF4 ions: PF4
-, BrF4
-, ClF4
+, and AlF4
-. 
(a) Which of the ions have more than an octet of electrons 
around the central atom? (b) For which of the ions will the 
electron-domain and molecular geometries be the same? 
(c) Which of the ions will have an octahedral 
 
electron-domain geometry? (d) Which of the ions will 
exhibit a see-saw molecular geometry?
 9.88  Consider the molecule PF4Cl. (a) Draw a Lewis structure for 
the molecule, and predict its electron-domain geometry. 
 
(b) Which would you expect to take up more space, a P¬ F 
bond or a P¬Cl
