 the B sugar attached. For the ii genotype, neither sugar is attached.
You should be aware of why blood transfusions must be made between individuals of like phenotypes. If an
individual with IBIB, IBi, or ii blood is given type A blood, then the immune system of the recipient will identify
the A sugar on the introduced red blood cells as a foreign substance. The immune system responds to foreign
substances (antigens) by producing antibodies that attack the antigens. The result is clumping, or agglutination, of
the blood and possibly death. Individuals with AB type blood can accept any blood type because both A and B
sugars are recognized as “self.” Also, anyone can accept O type blood because it contains neither A nor B sugars.
Thus, a person with O type blood is a universal donor for the ABO blood group (other blood-group types, such as
Rh, also need to match).
Polygenic Inheritance
Many traits are not expressed in just two or three varieties, such as yellow and green pea seeds or A,
