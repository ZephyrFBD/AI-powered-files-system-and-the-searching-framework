(A) Celery cells have a higher water potential than both the distilled water and the 1.0 molar sodium chloride
solution.
(B) Celery cells have a lower water potential than both the distilled water and the 1.0 molar sodium chloride
solution.
(C) Celery cells have a higher water potential than the distilled water and a lower water potential than the 1.0
molar sodium chloride solution.
(D) Celery cells have a lower water potential than the distilled water and a higher water potential than the 1.0
molar sodium chloride solution.
22. When carbon dioxide is added to water, carbonic acid forms and the pH of the solution decreases. Ten alginate
beads of the photosynthetic algae Chlorella vulgaris are placed in clear glass vials, along with a pH indicator
dye. One vial is wrapped in foil to exclude all light. Both vials are placed under a light source for 40 minutes.
The pH is recorded every 10 minutes. The data are shown in the table.
