FIGURE 23–15 Rays leave point 
on the object (an arrow). Shown 
are the three most useful rays for 
determining where the image 
is 
formed. [Note that our mirror is not 
small compared to f, so our diagram 
will not give the precise position of 
the image.]

Image Formation—Ray Diagrams
We saw that for an object at infinity, the image is located at the focal point of a
concave spherical mirror, where
But where does the image lie for an
object not at infinity? First consider the object shown as an arrow in Fig. 23–15a,
which is placed between F and C at point O (O for object). Let us determine where
the image will be for a given point 
at the top of the object, by finding the point
where rays drawn from the tip of the arrow converge after reflecting from 
the mirro
