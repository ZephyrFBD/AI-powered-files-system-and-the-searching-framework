al charge passes by a given point in the
circuit during those 4.0 min? (b) How many electrons would this be?
APPROACH (a) Current is flow of charge per unit time, Eq.18–1, so the amount of
charge passing a point is the product of the current and the time interval. (b) To get
the number of electrons, we divide the total charge by the charge on one electron.
SOLUTION (a) Since the current was 2.5 A, or 
then in 4.0 min 
the total charge that flowed past a given point in the wire was, from Eq. 18–1,
(b) The charge on one electron is 
so 600 C would consist of
600 C
1.6 * 10–19 Celectron = 3.8 * 1021 electrons.
1.60 * 10–19 C,
¢Q = I ¢t = (2.5 Cs)(240 s) = 600 C.
(= 240 s)
2.5 Cs,
