STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND PROBABILITY
o = observed results
e = expected results
Degrees of freedom equal the number of distinct possible outcomes minus one.
LAWS OF PROBABILITY
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
If A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
HARDY-WEINBERG EQUATIONS
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
p = frequency of the dominant allele in a population
p + q = 1
q = frequency of the recessive allele in a population

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND PROBABILITY
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the
greatest (sample maximum)
