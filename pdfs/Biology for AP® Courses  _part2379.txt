inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion
inhibitors), the conversion of its RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase inhibitors), the integration
of the viral DNA into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors).

Figure 21.17 HIV, an enveloped, icosahedral virus, attaches to the CD4 receptor of an immune cell and fuses with
the cell membrane. Viral contents are released into the cell, where viral enzymes convert the single-stranded RNA
genome into DNA and incorporate it into the host genome. (credit: NIAID, NIH)
When any of these drugs are used individually, the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily and rapidly develop
resistance to the drug, limiting the drugâ€™s effectiveness. The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development
of HAART, highly active antiretroviral therapy, which involves a mixture of different d
