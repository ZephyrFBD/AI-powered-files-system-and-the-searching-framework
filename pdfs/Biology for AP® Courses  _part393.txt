ibose. In this problem, we need to look at the
molecules in slightly more detail so that you can
development the ability to explain why DNA, and
sometimes RNA, is the primary source of heritable
information.
Edwin Chargaff and his team isolated nucleobases from
salmon sperm and determined the fraction of each
(Chargaff et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 192,
1951). Experiments in which the fraction of all four
nucleobases was determined are shown. Also shown are
averages as two standard deviations and the sum of total
fractions for each experiment. Precision is calculated with
each average.
Shown below are the chemical structures of these four
nucleobases. In these structures, the nitrogen that attaches
to the 2-deoxyribose, 5-phosphate polymer is indicated as
N*. The partial charges of particular atoms are indicated
