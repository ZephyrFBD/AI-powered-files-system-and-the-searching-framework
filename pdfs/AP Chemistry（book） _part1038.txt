ng time in a 
different salt solution, such as strontium chloride, would you 
still observe 589-nm light emission?
 6.83  Certain elements emit light of a speciﬁc wavelength when 
they are burned. Historically, chemists used such emission 
wavelengths to determine whether speciﬁc elements were 
present in a sample. Characteristic wavelengths for some of 
the elements are given in the following table:
Ag
328.1 nm
Fe
372.0 nm
Au
267.6 nm
K
404.7 nm
Ba
455.4 nm
Mg
285.2 nm
Ca
422.7 nm
Na
589.6 nm
Cu
324.8 nm
Ni
341.5 nm
 
 (a) Determine which elements emit radiation in the visible 
part of the spectrum. (b) Which element emits photons of 
highest energy? Of lowest energy? (c) When burned, a sample 
of an unknown substance is found to emit light of frequency 
9.23 * 1014 s - 1. Which of these elements is probably in the 
sample?
 6.84  In August 2011, the Juno spacecraft was launched from Earth 
with the mission of orbiting Jupiter, arriving nearly ﬁve years 
later in July of 2016. The dis
