y end up with a residual mass
less than about 1.4 solar masses. A residual mass of 1.4 solar masses is known as
the Chandrasekhar limit. For stars smaller than this, no further fusion energy can
be obtained because of the large Coulomb repulsion between nuclei. The core 
of such a “low mass” star (original 
solar masses) contracts under 
gravity. The outer envelope expands again and the star becomes an even 
brighter and larger red giant, Fig. 33–8. Eventually the outer layers escape into
space, and the newly revealed surface is hotter than before. So the star moves to
the left in the H–R diagram (horizontal dashed line in Fig. 33–8). Then, as the
core shrinks the star cools, and typically follows the downward dashed route
shown on the left in Fig. 33–8, becoming a white dwarf. A white dwarf with
a residual mass equal to that of the Sun would be about the size of the Earth.
A white dwarf contracts to the point at which the electrons start to overlap, but
no further because, by the Paul
