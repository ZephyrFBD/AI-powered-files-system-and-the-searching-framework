ls, beginning with control of access to DNA. Because genomic DNA is folded around histone proteins to
create nucleosome complexes, nucleosomes physically regulate the access of proteins, such as transcription factors and
enzymes, to the underlying DNA. Methylation of DNA and histones causes nucleosomes to pack tightly together, preventing
transcription factors from binding to the DNA. Methylated nucleosomes contain DNA that is not expressed. On the other
hand, histone acetylation results in loose packing of nucleosomes, allowing transcription factors to bind to DNA. Acetylated
nucleosomes contain DNA that may be expressed.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A Learning O
