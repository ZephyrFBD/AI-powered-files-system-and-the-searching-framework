extraneous material in your answer.
At this stage of your school career, it may not be necessary to remind you of some basic preparations
right before test day—but we will anyway because they’re tried-and-true: Get a good night’s sleep the
night before the exam, eat a good breakfast, and don’t forget to bring a bunch of those famous No. 2

Here’s a handy chart of what to bring to the exam and what you cannot have in the exam room:
Yes
No
• Several sharpened No. 2 pencils (with erasers) for completing the
multiple-choice questions
• One or two reliable dark blue or black ink pens for filling out
identifying information on the exam booklet covers and for
answering the free- response questions. Avoid pens that clump or
bleed.
• A wristwatch, so you can monitor your time. Make sure it does not
beep or have an alarm.
