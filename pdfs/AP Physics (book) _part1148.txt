Any oscillating system for which the net restoring force is directly propor-
tional to the negative of the displacement (as in Eq. 11–1,
) is said to
exhibit simple harmonic motion (SHM).† Such a system is often called a simple
harmonic oscillator (SHO). We saw in Section 9–5 that most solid materials
stretch or compress according to Eq. 11–1 as long as the displacement is not too
great. Because of this, many natural oscillations are simple harmonic, or suffi-
ciently close to it that they can be treated using this SHM model.
F = –kx
Is the motion simple harmonic? Which
of the following forces would cause an object to move in simple harmonic motion?
(a) 
(b)
(c) 
(d)
RESPONSE Both (b) and (d) will give simple harmonic motion because they
give the force as minus a constant times a displacement. The displacement need
not be x, but the minus sign is required to restore the system to e
