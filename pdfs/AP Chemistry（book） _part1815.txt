 Use the phase diagram to answer the following questions. 
(a) What is the approximate value of the normal melting 
point? (b) Over what pressure range will solid neon sub-
lime? (c) At room temperature 1T =  
25 °C2 can neon be liq-
uefied by compressing it?
 11.62  Use the phase diagram of neon to answer the following 
questions. (a) What is the approximate value of the normal 
boiling point? (b) What can you say about the strength of 
the intermolecular forces in neon and argon based on the 
critical points of Ne and Ar (see Table 11.5.)?
 11.63  The fact that water on Earth can readily be found in all 
three states (solid, liquid, and gas) is in part a consequence
