60. In pea seeds, yellow color (Y ) is dominant to 
green color (y), and a round shape (R) is 
dominant to a wrinkled shape (r). A dihybrid 
cross between a true-breeding plant with yellow, 
round seeds (YYRR) and a true-breeding plant 
with green, wrinkled seeds (yyrr) results in an 
F1 generation of plants with yellow, round 
seeds. Crossing two F1 plants produces an F2 
generation with approximately nine times as 
many plants with yellow, round seeds as plants 
with green, wrinkled seeds. 
Which of the following best explains these 
results? 
(A) The allele pairs of each parent stay 
together, resulting in gametes that are 
identical to the parents. 
(B) Gene segments on sister chromatids cross 
over. 
(C) Alleles that are on nonhomologous 
chromosomes recombine. 
(D) The genes for seed color and seed shape 
assort independently.
