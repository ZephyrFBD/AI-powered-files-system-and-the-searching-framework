to form conclusions, and 
apply their conclusions to larger biological concepts. 
Students should report recorded data and quantitative 
conclusions drawn from the data with appropriate 
precision (i.e., significant figures). Students should 
also develop an understanding of how changes in the 
design of the experiments would impact the validity 
and accuracy of their results. Many questions on the 
AP exam are written in an experimental context, so 
these skills will prove invaluable for both concept 
comprehension and exam performance.
Lab Time 
Both the teacher and the student manuals are free 
and available on the College Board website. Though 
this lab manual isnâ€™t required, it includes laboratory 
investigations that teachers can choose from to satisfy 
the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Some 
textbook publishers may provide a lab manual as an 
ancillary to the textbook, and most science classroom 
supply companies also offer lab manuals. 
It is critical that lab wo
