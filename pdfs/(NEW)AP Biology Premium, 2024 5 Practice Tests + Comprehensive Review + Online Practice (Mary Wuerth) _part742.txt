er cohesive properties than the other liquids, and therefore water forms more hydrogen bonds than the
other liquids. Choice (A) is incorrect because vegetable oil is a nonpolar compound and does not form hydrogen
bonds. Ions are attracted to metals, not repelled, so choice (C) is incorrect. Ethanol is a larger molecule than
water, but it does not form more hydrogen bonds than water. So choice (D) is incorrect.
33. (D) Starch molecules are too large to pass through the semipermeable membrane, but water and iodine can pass
through the membrane. Iodine will move down its concentration gradient from side A to side B and react with
the starch molecules, which will turn dark blue. Since the starch molecules cannot move down their
concentration gradient and will remain on side B, the water potential on side B will be lower than the water
potential on side A. Water will move from the area of higher water potential on side A to the area of lower
water potential on side B, raising the water leve
