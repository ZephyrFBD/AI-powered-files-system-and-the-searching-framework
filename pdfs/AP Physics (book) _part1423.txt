he number of moles n using the given volume.
Then we can multiply by the mass of one mole to get the total mass.
SOLUTION Example 13–9 told us that 1 mol of a gas at 0°C has a volume of
22.4 L
The room’s volume is
so
Air is a mixture of about 20% oxygen 
and 80% nitrogen 
The molecular
masses are 
and
respectively, for an average
of about 29 u. Thus, 1 mol of air has a mass of about
so our
room has a mass of air
NOTE That is roughly 100 lb of air!
m L (1700 mol)(0.029 kgmol) L 50 kg.
29 g = 0.029 kg,
2 * 14 u = 28 u,
2 * 16 u = 32 u

n =
(5 m)(3 m)(2.5 m)
22.4 * 10–3 m3mol L 1700 mol.
5 m * 3 m * 2.5 m,
= 22.4 * 10–3 m3.
5 m * 3 m * 2.5 m

EXERCISE D At 20°C, would there be (a) more, (b) less, or (c) the same mass of air in a
room than at 0°C?
Frequently, volume is specified in liters and pressure in atmospheres. Rather
than convert these to SI units, we can instead use the value of R given in 
Section 13–6 as
In many situations it is not necessary to
