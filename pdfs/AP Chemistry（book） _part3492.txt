d that has C ¬C s bonds but no p bonds. Other allotropes of 
carbon have p bonds that result from the sideways overlap of p orbitals. Elemental sili-
con, however, exists only as a diamond-like covalent-network solid with s bonds; it has 
no forms analogous to graphite, buckminsterfullerene, graphene, or carbon nanotubes, 
apparently because Si¬Si p bonds are too weak.
We likewise see significant differences in the dioxides of carbon and silicon as a 
result of their relative abilities to form p bonds (Figure 22.3). CO2 is a molecular substance 
containing C “O double bonds, whereas SiO2 is a covalent-network solid in which four 
oxygen atoms are bonded to each silicon atom by single bonds, forming an extended 
structure that has the empirical formula SiO2.
Of the elements Li, K, N, P, and Ne, which (a) is the most electronegative, (b) has the greatest metallic character, (c) can bond to 
more than four atoms in a molecule, and (d) forms p bonds most readily?
