n the nonbonding atomic radius. Unless other-
wise noted, we mean the bonding atomic radius when we speak of the “size” of an atom.
Although it is very difficult to measure the nonbonding atomic radius of an atom, 
scientists have developed a variety of techniques for measuring the distances separating 
nuclei in molecules. From observations of these distances in many molecules, each ele-
ment can be assigned a bonding atomic radius. For example, in the I2 molecule, the dis-
tance separating the nuclei is observed to be 2.66 Å, which means the bonding atomic 
radius of an iodine atom in I2 is 12.66 A
° 2>2 = 1.33 A
° .* Similarly, the distance separating 
adjacent carbon nuclei in diamond (a three-dimensional solid network of carbon atoms) is 
1.54 Å; thus, the bonding atomic radius of carbon in diamond is 0.77 Å. By using  
structural 
information on more than 30,000 substances, a consistent set of bonding atomic radii of 
the elements can be defined (Figure 7.7). Note that for the li
