he following question:
•
What are the genetic consequences that result from nondisjunction and errors in chromosome structure through
inversions and translocations?
Connection for AP® Courses
The number, size, shape, and banding patterns of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows for
the assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities. Although the cell cycle, mitosis, and meiosis are highly regulated to

prevent errors, the processes are not perfect. One example is the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids
to separate properly during meiosis I or meiosis II (a phenomenon referred to as nondisjunction). This results in gametes
with too many or too few chromosomes. Disorders in chromosome number (aneuploidy) are typically lethal to the embryo,
although a few trisomic genotypes are viable (e.g., Down syndrome). Beca
