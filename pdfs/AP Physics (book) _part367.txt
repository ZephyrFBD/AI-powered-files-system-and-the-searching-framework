(a) A 10-kg gift box is at rest on a 
table. (b) A person pushes down on 
the box with a force of 40.0 N.
(c) A person pulls upward on the 
box with a force of 40.0 N. The forces
are all assumed to act along a line;
they are shown slightly displaced in 
order to be distinguishable. Only 
forces acting on the box are shown.

Accelerating the box. What happens when a person pulls
upward on the box in Example 4–6c with a force equal to, or greater than,
the box’s weight? For example, let 
(Fig. 4–16) rather than the
40.0 N shown in Fig. 4–15c.
APPROACH We can start just as in Example 4–6, but be ready for a surprise.
SOLUTION The net force on the box is
and if we set this equal to zero (thinking the acceleration might be zero), we
would get  
This is nonsense, since the negative sign implies 
points downward, and the table surely cannot pull down on the box (unless
there’s glue on the table). The least 
can be is zero, wh
