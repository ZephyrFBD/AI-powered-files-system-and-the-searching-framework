1. (a) Describe the difference between a real image and a
virtual image? (b) Can your eyes tell the difference? (c) How
can you tell the difference on a ray diagram? (d) How
could you tell the difference between a virtual image and a
real image experimentally? (e) If you were to take a photo-
graph of a virtual image, would you see the image in the
photograph? (f) If you were to put a piece of photographic
film at the location of a virtual image, would the image be
captured on the film? (g) Explain any differences in your
answers to parts (e) and (f).
