(CO2) concentration of 700 μmol CO2 / mol of air. The CO2 concentration in the chambers was approximately 
double that of normal concentrations of environmental CO2. 
Photosynthetic rate is measured by the amount of CO2 exchanged in an area of leaf surface over time. The rate 
is directly influenced by the activity of the plant enzyme rubisco. During photosynthesis, rubisco fixes 
atmospheric carbon into an organic molecule as one of the first steps in the Calvin cycle. 
Scientists measured the amount of carbon fixation that occurred in the leaves of soybean plants grown at each 
temperature shown in Table 1.
