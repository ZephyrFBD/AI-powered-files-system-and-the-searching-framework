circuit is often called an oscillator
circuit. What is it that oscillates?
*29. Is the ac current in the inductor always the same as the
current in the resistor of an LRC circuit? Explain.
1. A coil rests in the plane of the page while a magnetic field
is directed into the page. A clockwise current is induced
(a) when the magnetic field gets stronger.
(b) when the size of the coil decreases.
(c) when the coil is moved sideways across the page.
(d) when the magnetic field is tilted so it is no longer
perpendicular to the page.
2. A wire loop moves at constant velocity without rotation
through a constant magnetic field. The induced current in
the loop will be
(a) clockwise.
(b) counterclockwise.
(c) zero.
(d) We need to know the orientation of the loop relative to
the magnetic field.
3. A square loop moves to the right from an area where
completely through a region containing a uniform
magnetic field directed into the page (Fig. 21â€“52), and then
out to
after point L. A current is induced
