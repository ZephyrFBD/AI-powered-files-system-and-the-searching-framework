 14.121 The mechanism for the oxidation of HBr by O2 to form 
2 H2O and Br2 is shown in Exercise 14.74. (a) Calculate the 
overall standard enthalpy change for the reaction pro-
cess. (b) HBr does not react with O2 at a measurable rate 
at room temperature under ordinary conditions. What 
can you infer from this about the magnitude of the acti-
vation energy for the rate-determining step? (c) Draw a 
plausible Lewis structure for the intermediate HOOBr. To

explanation for the “sticking” of ethylene to a metal 
surface is the interaction of the electrons in the C ¬ C p 
bond with vacant orbitals on the metal surface. (a) If this 
notion is correct, would ethane be expected to adsorb to a 
metal surface, and, if so, how strongly would ethane bind 
compared to ethylene? (b) Based on its Lewis structure, 
would you expect ammonia to adsorb to a metal surface 
using a similar explanation as for ethylene?
