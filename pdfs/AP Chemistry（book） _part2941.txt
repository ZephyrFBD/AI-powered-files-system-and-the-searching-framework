tage of the atoms from the starting materials end up in the product.
Give It Some Thought
Assuming the by-products shown in green (phenol and acetone) are recycled, what 
atoms, if any, used in the new process for making hydroquinone do not end up in 
the final products?

Another example of atom economy is a reaction in which, at room temperature and 
in the presence of a copper(I) catalyst, an organic azide and an alkyne form one product 
molecule:

This reaction is informally called a click reaction. The yield—actual, not just theoretical—
is close to 100%, and there are no by-products. Depending on the type of azide and type 
of alkyne we start with, this very efficient click reaction can be used to create any number 
of valuable product molecules.
Give It Some Thought
What are the hybridizations of the two alkyne C atoms before and after the click
