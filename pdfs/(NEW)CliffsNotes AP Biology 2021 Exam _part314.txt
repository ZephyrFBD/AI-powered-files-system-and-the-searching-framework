disease. Griffith concluded that genetic information from the
dead bacteria with polysaccharide coats transformed the bacteria without coats, giving them the ability to make
coats and cause disease. Today, the term transformation is used to describe the ability of bacteria to absorb and
express genetic information (now known to be DNA) obtained from their surroundings.
2. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty identify DNA as the heredity information of a cell. Using the same bacteria
used by Griffith, bacteriologists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty removed the proteins and
polysaccharide coats from the dead, diseasecausing bacteria. They found that the remaining material was still able to
transform bacteria, giving previously harmless bacteria the ability to cause disease. Further tests confirmed that the
transforming material was not RNA, but a substance with the same properties as DNA.
3. The Hershey and Chase experiments establish that DNA was the genetic material of phages. A
