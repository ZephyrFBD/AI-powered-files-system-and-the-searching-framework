membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting due to increasing volume). The chemical
composition of the cell walls varies between archaea and bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species.
Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides
containing both L- and D-amino acids including D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. Proteins normally have only L-amino
acids; as a consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking D-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on
bacterial cell wall development. There are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan. S-layer (surface layer) proteins
are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria.
Bacteria are divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on their reaction to Gram staining.
Note that all Gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (Proteobacteria, Chlamydias,
Spirochetes, Cy
