the domain Archaea comprises the rest of the prokaryotes,
and the domain Eukarya comprises all eukaryotes, including protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Prokaryotes exhibit great
diversity in form and function and are abundant and ubiquitous. In addition to inhabiting moderate environments like the
human digestive system, prokaryotes are found in extreme conditions (extremophiles), from boiling hot springs to the Great
Salt Lake and to frozen environments in Antarctica.
Because prokaryotes inhabit many different environments, they have evolved multiple strategies for meeting their energy
demands, including chemosynthesis, photosynthesis, anaerobic cellular respiration, and aerobic cellular respiration. Hot
springs and hydrothermal vents may have been the environments in which life began, and there is fossil evidence of the
presence of microbial mats about 3.5 billion years ago. During the first two billion years of Earthâ€™s history, the atmosphere
lacked sufficient quantities of oxyge
