m of carbon, 
whereas compound B contains 2.666 g of oxygen per gram of carbon.
(a) Does this observation illustrate the law of conservation of mass or the 
law of multiple proportions?
(b) If compound A has an equal number of oxygen and carbon atoms, what 
can we conclude about the composition of compound B?
2.2 âˆ£ The Discovery of Atomic Structure
Dalton based his conclusions about atoms on chemical observations made in the labora-
tory. By assuming the existence of atoms, he was able to account for the laws of constant 
composition and of multiple proportions. But neither Dalton nor those who followed 
him during the century after his work was published had any direct evidence for the ex-
istence of atoms. Today, however, we can measure the properties of individual atoms and 
even provide images of them (Figure 2.2).
As scientists developed methods for probing the nature of matter, the suppos-
edly indivisible atom began to show signs of a more complex structure, and today 
we know t
