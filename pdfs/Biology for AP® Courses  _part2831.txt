it has proportionally a less dense matrix.
The organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. Collagen
fibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. Elastic fibers
are made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape.
Elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues. Reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues.
This fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which
it is connected. The various types of connective tissues, the types of cells and fibers they are made of, and sample locations
of the tissues is summarized in Table 24.3.
