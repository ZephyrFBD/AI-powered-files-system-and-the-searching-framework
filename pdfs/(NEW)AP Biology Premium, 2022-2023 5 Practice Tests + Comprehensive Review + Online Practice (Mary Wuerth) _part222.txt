11. NAD+ has an important role as an electron carrier in glycolysis.
(a) Identify the process of aerobic cellular respiration during which a cell replenishes its supply of NAD+.
(b) Identify the process of anaerobic respiration during which a cell replenishes its supply of NAD+.
(c) If a cellâ€™s supply of NAD+ ran out, predict the effect that would have on glycolysis within that cell.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. In eukaryotes, ATP synthase is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. In prokaryotes, which do not
have mitochondria, it is found on infoldings of the cell membrane.
(a) Make a claim as to why ATP synthase is found on the cell membrane in prokaryotes.
(b) Justify your claim from part (a) using your knowledge of how ATP synthase works.
(c) Explain why ATP synthase would not be effective if it was found in the cytosol of a cell.
(d) Describe ho
