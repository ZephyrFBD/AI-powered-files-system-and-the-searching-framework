red substance on the right is Fe2O3, which 
contains Fe3 + ions.

CHAPTER 2 Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
c.  
Cations formed from molecules composed of nonmetal atoms have names that end in 
-ium:
NH4
+
ammonium ion
H3O+
hydronium ion
These two ions are the only ions of this kind that we will encounter frequently in 
the text.
The names and formulas of some common cations are shown in Table 2.4 
and on the back inside cover of the text. The ions on the left side in Table 2.4  are 
the monatomic ions that do not have more than one possible charge. Those on 
the right side are either polyatomic cations or cations with more than one possi-
ble charge. The Hg2
2+ ion is unusual because, even though it is a metal ion, it is 
not monatomic. It is called the mercury(I) ion because it can be thought of as two 
Hg+ ions bound together. The cations that you will encounter most frequently in 
this text are shown in boldface. You should learn these cations first.
