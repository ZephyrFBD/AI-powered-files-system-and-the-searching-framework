 this chapter, we have learned about the photoelectric effect and its 
impact on the formulation of light as photons. We have also seen 
that some anomalous electron configurations of the elements are 
particularly favorable if each atom has one or more half-filled shell, 
such as the case for the Cr atom with its [Ar]4s13d5 electron configu-
ration. Let’s suppose it is hypothesized that it requires more energy 
to remove an electron from a metal that has atoms with one or more 
half-filled shells than from those that do not. (a) Design a series of 
experiments involving the photoelectric effect that would test the 
hypothesis. (b) What experimental apparatus would be needed to 
test the hypothesis? It’s not necessary that you name actual equip-
ment but rather that you imagine how the apparatus would work—
think in terms of the types of measurements that would be needed, 
and what capability you would need in your apparatus. (c) Describe 
the type of data you would collect and how you
