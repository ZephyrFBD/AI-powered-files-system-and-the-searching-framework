The surface area-to-volume ratio concept can also be applied to organisms. As organisms increase in size, their ratio
will decrease and this can affect properties of the organism, such as heat-exchange with their surroundings. Small
organisms lose heat at much higher rates than larger organisms as a result of their efficient exchange of heat.
Remember, even the largest things are still made of cells.
TYPES OF CELLS AND ORGANELLES
For centuries, scientists have known about cells. However, it wasnâ€™t until the development of the electron
microscope that scientists were able to figure out what cells do. We now know that there are two distinct types of
cells: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.
Cells are studied with different types of microscopes. Light microscopes (for example, the
compound microscopes commonly found in labs) are used to study stained or living cells.
They can magnify the size of an organism up to 1,000 times. Electron microscopes are used
