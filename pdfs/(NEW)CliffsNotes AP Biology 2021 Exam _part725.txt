 process begins again.
The first community to occupy the lake consists of pioneer species with r-selected characteristics. These
characteristics include good dispersal ability, rapid growth, and rapid reproduction of many offspring. The lake is
first populated by algae and protists, then followed by rotifers, mollusks, insects, and other arthropods. Various
vegetation, such as grasses, sedges, rushes, and cattails, grows at the perimeter of the lake. Submerged vegetation
(growing on the lake bottom) is replaced by vegetation that emerges from the surface, perhaps covering the surface
with leaves. As the plants and animals die, they add to the organic matter that fills the lake. In addition, sediment is
deposited by water from streams that enter the lake. Eventually, the lake becomes marshy as it is overrun by
vegetation. When the lake is completely filled, it becomes a meadow, occupied by plants and animals that are
adapted to a dry, rather than marshy, habitat. Subsequently, the meado
