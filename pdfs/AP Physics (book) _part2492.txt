source. At a distance of 5.0 m, what is the intensity, and
what is the rms value of the electric field?
26. (II) If the amplitude of the B field of an EM wave is
(a) what is the amplitude of the E field?
(b) What is the average power transported across unit area
by the EM wave?
27. (II) What is the average energy contained in a
volume near the Earth’s surface due to radiant energy
from the Sun? See Example 22–4.
28. (II) A 15.8-mW laser puts out a narrow beam 2.40 mm in
diameter. What are the rms values of E and B in the beam?
29. (II) Estimate the average power output of the Sun, given
that about 
reaches the upper atmosphere of
the Earth.
30. (II) A high-energy pulsed laser emits a 1.0-ns-long pulse of
average power 
The beam is nearly a cylinder
in radius. Determine (a) the energy deliv-
ered in each pulse, and (b) the rms value of the electric field.
