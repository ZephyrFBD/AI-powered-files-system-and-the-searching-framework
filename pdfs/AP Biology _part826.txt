he independent variable (the various
molarities) on the x-axis. The bag that contains distilled water will not
change in mass because its contents are isotonic to the distilled water in
the beaker; this bag is the control. The mass of the other bags will
increase. The bag with the lowest molarity will increase in mass the least,
and the bag with the highest molarity will increase the most. See Figure
19.8.

PART 2C: DETERMINE THE MOLARITY OF A LIVING
(POTATO) CELL.
Cut identical-size small cubes of potato and weigh them. Place each into a
beaker covered with 300 mL of the following sucrose solutions: 0.2 M, 0.4
M, 0.6 M, 0.8 M, and 1.0 M and one with distilled water. Allow them to sit
overnight, then weigh them again. Some pieces of potato will have gained
mass and some will have lost mass. Calculate the percent change in mass
for each. Plot a line of best fit on a graph, with the mo
