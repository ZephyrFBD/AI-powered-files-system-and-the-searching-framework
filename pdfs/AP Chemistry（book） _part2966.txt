l surface temperature of a 1.00 square meter patch 
of ocean is 26 °C, what is its final temperature after being in 
sunlight for 12 h, assuming no phase changes and assuming 
that sunlight penetrates uniformly to depth of 10.0 cm?
 [18.40]  The enthalpy of fusion of water is 6.01 kJ>mol. Sunlight 
striking Earth’s surface supplies 168 W per square meter 
11 W = 1 watt = 1 J>s2. (a) Assuming that melting of ice 
is due only to energy input from the Sun, calculate how 
many grams of ice could be melted from a 1.00 square 
meter patch of ice over a 12-h day. (b) The specific heat 
capacity of ice is 2.032 J>g °C. If the initial temperature of 
a 1.00 square meter patch of ice is -5.0 °C, what is its final 
temperature after being in sunlight for 12 h, assuming no 
phase changes and assuming that sunlight penetrates uni-
formly to a depth of 1.00 cm?
