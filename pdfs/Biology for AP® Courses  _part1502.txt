 (reading the sequence of DNA) was a relatively expensive and long process. Using
radiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns. With currently available technology and
automated machines, the process is cheap, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. Fred Sanger developed the
sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today (Figure 14.8).

technique that resulted from Sanger’s work.
Describe one advantage and a possible limitation to Sanger’s method.
a.
Sanger’s method can be used to sequence more than one strand at a time which is less time consuming.
Challenges of Sanger’s method includes its decreased accuracy to sequence DNA strands.
b.
Sanger’s method is a reliable and accurate way of sequencing DNA strands. However, only one strand at a
time can be sequenced at a time. Also, it can look
