The masses of atoms are usually expressed in terms of atomic mass 
units  11 amu = 1.66054 * 10-24 g2. The dimensions of atoms are 
 
often expressed in units of angstroms 11 A
° = 10-10 m2. 
Elements can be classified by atomic number, the number of pro-
tons in the nucleus of an atom. All atoms of a given element have the 
same atomic number. The mass number of an atom is the sum of the 
numbers of protons and neutrons. Atoms of the same element that 
differ in mass number are known as isotopes.
ATOMIC WEIGHTS (SECTION 2.4) The atomic mass scale is de-
fined by assigning a mass of exactly 12 amu to a 12C atom. The atomic 
weight  (average atomic mass) of an element can be calculated from 
the relative abundances and masses of that element’s isotopes. The 
mass spectrometer  provides the most direct and accurate means of ex-
perimentally measuring atomic (and molecular) weights.
