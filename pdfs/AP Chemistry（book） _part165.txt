ropane. When the grill is operating, 
propane reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. For every gram of propane that reacts with oxygen in this way, 46 kJ 
of energy is released as heat. (a) How much energy is released if the entire contents of the propane tank react with oxygen? 
(b) As the propane reacts, does the potential energy stored in chemical bonds increase or decrease? (c) If you were to store an 
equivalent amount of potential energy by pumping water to an elevation of 75 m above the ground, what mass of water would be 
needed? (Note: The force due to gravity acting on the water, which is the waterâ€™s weight, is F = m * g, where m Is the mass of 
the object and g is the gravitational constant, g = 9.8 m/s2.)
(a) Calculate the density of mercury if 1.00 * 102 g occupies a volume of 7.36 cm3.
(b) Calculate the volume of 65.0 g of liquid methanol (wood alcohol) if its density is 0.791 g/mL.
(c) What is the mass in grams of a cube of gold (density = 19.32 g/cm3) if t
