ed antigens is an adaptive response.
Generic pathogen identifiers such as bacterial surface
polysaccharides or viral capsid proteins are recognized by
cells of the innate immune system. However, cellular
debris and dysfunctional whole cells such as tumor cells or
cells marked for apoptosis must also be recognized for
autophagy (“self-devouring”) by the innate immune
system.
A. Describe the characteristics of a model of innate
immunity that distinguishes wellness from un-wellness
without the specificity of antigen receptors.
Autoimmunity is the breakdown in the immune system’s
ability to distinguish self from non-self. The list of
diseases categorized as autoimmune diseases grows, as
does the intensity of research into the causes. One criterion
for classification as an autoimmune disease is the presence
of high antibody concentrations in the blood. An auto-
inflammatory disease is defined by chronic inflammation,
unprovoked by an infection, when antibody concentrations
are not high. Con
