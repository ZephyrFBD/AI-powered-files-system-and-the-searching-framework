 Paddy and I leave together. I’m bursting and run behind a garage to 
 
 pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he 
 
 says,That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an’ him an’ his mother is 
 
 very holy but I wouldn’t want to go to Fintan’s flat anymore because 
 
 he’s very odd, isn’t he, Frankie? 
 
 He is, Paddy. 
 
 The way he looks at it when you take it out, that’s odd, isn’t it, 
 
 Frankie? 
 
 ’Tis, Paddy. 
 
 A few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come 
 
 to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won’t be there and she leaves his 
 
 lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk.Will 
 
 we go? 
 
 Fintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me 
 
 and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say,Will you come? I 
 
  
  
 whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us 
 
 to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing
