comes a gas as it is warmed above its boiling point 121.2 °C2, and the gas turns 
darker as the colorless N2O4 gas dissociates into brown NO2 gas. Eventually, even 
though there is still N2O4 in the tube, the color stops getting darker because the sys-
tem reaches equilibrium. We are left with an equilibrium mixture of N2O4 and NO2 in 
which the concentrations of the gases no longer change as time passes. Because the 
reaction is in a closed system, no gases escape, and the equilibrium mixture can be 
maintained.

If you were to let the tube on the right sit overnight and then take another 
picture, would the brown color look darker, lighter, or the same?
N2O4
NO2
 Frozen N2O4 sample 
is nearly colorless.
On warming, the N2O4 
becomes a gas and 
partially dissociates to 
form brown NO2(g).
Colors stop changing when equilibrium is 
reached: rate of forward reaction
N2O4(g)        2 NO2(g) = rate of reverse 
reaction 2 NO2(g)        N2O4(g).
