■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Day 2 
When developing their own investigations, students should choose substances to test 
that are interesting to them. They may have experiences with fruit flies in their home and 
can think about what attracts flies. They also may want to find a substance that would 
repel a fly. They can bring substances from home to test, but make sure they obtain your 
permission to use the substances before they conduct their tests. The students should 
work in groups to determine the chemotactic response to various food items. They 
should share and graphically illustrate their results.
