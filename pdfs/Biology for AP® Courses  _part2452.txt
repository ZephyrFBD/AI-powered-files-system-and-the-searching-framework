ary among groups, and many have additional structures such as flagella and pili.
Prokaryotes also have ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs. For the purpose of AP®, you do not have to memorize the
various groups of bacteria. You should, however, be able to distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and know the

Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 3
of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
