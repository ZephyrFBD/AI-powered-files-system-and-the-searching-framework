 pathogenic bacteria.
(B) Protein from the pathogenic bacteria was taken up by the nonpathogenic bacteria.
(C) DNA from the pathogenic bacteria was taken up by the nonpathogenic bacteria.
(D) DNA in the nonpathogenic bacteria turned into pathogenic genes in the absence of pathogenic bacteria.
11. A biologist systematically removes each of the proteins involved in DNA replication to determine the effect
each has on the process. In one experiment, after separating the strands of DNA, she sees many short
DNA/RNA fragments as well as some long DNA pieces. Which of the following is most likely missing?
(A) Helicase
(B) DNA polymerase
(C) DNA ligase
(D) RNA primase
Summary
DNA is the genetic material of the cell.
DNA structure is composed of two antiparallel complementary strands, including:
Deoxyribose sugar and phosphate backbone connected by phosphodiester bonds with nitrogenous bases
hydrogen bonded together pointing toward the middle. The two strands are oriented antiparallel with 3â€™ an
