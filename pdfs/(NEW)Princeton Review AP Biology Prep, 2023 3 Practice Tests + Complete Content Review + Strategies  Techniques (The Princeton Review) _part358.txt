en a single nucleotide base is substituted for another. There are three
different types of point mutations:
Nonsense mutations cause the original codon to become a stop codon, which results in early termination of
protein synthesis.
Missense mutations cause the original codon to be altered and produce a different amino acid.
Silent mutations happen when a codon that codes for the same amino acid is created and therefore does not
change the corresponding protein sequence.
There are two types of mutations: base substitutions and gene
rearrangements.
Gene Rearrangements
Gene rearrangements involve DNA sequences that have deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.
1. Insertions and deletions result in the gain or loss, respectively, of DNA or a gene. They can involve either the
addition (insertion) or removal (deletion) of as little as a single base or much larger sequences of DNA.
Insertions and deletions may have devastating consequences during protein translation because t
