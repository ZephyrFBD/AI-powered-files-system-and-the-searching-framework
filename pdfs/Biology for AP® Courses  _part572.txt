e-quarter cup of sugar. If the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same, which cup contains more water?
Because the large amount of sugar in the second cup takes up much more space than the teaspoon of sugar in the first cup,
the first cup has more water in it.
Returning to the beaker example, recall that it has a mixture of solutes on either side of the membrane. A principle of
diffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can. However, only the
material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through
the membrane, but the water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system. Thus, water will diffuse down its
concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diffusion of water through the
membrane—osmosis—will continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero or until the hydrostatic press
