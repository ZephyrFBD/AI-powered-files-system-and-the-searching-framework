ave an exceptional ability to form strong stable bonds 
with one another.
Plastics are polymeric solids that can be formed into various shapes, usually by the 
application of heat and pressure. There are several types of plastics.
Thermoplastics can be reshaped. For example, plastic milk containers are made 
from the thermoplastic polymer polyethylene. These containers can be melted down and 
the polymer recycled for some other use. Over two million tons of plastic are recycled 
every year in the United States. If you look at the bottom of a plastic container, you are 
likely to see a recycle symbol containing a number, as shown in Figure 12.34. The num-
ber and the letter abbreviation below it indicate the kind of polymer from which the 
container is made, as summarized in Table 12.5. These symbols make it possible to sort 
containers by composition. In general, the lower the number, the greater the ease with 
which the material can be recycled.
Unlike a thermoplastic, a thermosetting
