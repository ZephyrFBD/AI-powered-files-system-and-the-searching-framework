e total mass of all living organisms) increase. Eventually, a final successional stage of constant
species composition, called the climax community, is attained. The climax community persists relatively
unchanged until destroyed by some catastrophic event, such as a fire.
Succession, however, is not as predictable as once thought. Successional stages may not always occur in the
expected order, and the establishment of some species is apparently random, influenced by season, by climatic
conditions, or by which species happens to arrive first. Furthermore, in some cases, a stable climax community is
never attained because fires or other disturbances occur so frequently.
Succession occurs in some regions when climates change over thousands of years. Over shorter periods of time,
succession occurs because species that make up communities alter the habitat by their presence. In both cases, the
physical and biological conditions which made the habitat initially attractive to the resident spe
