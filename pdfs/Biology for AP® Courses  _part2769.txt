nt could not pull water from the
soil.
88. The process of bulk flow transports fluids in a plant.
What are the two main bulk flow processes?
a.
Movement of water up the xylem and movement
of solutes up and down the phloem
b.
Movement of water up the phloem and
movement of solutes up and down the xylem.
c.
Movement of water up and down the xylem and
movement of solutes up the phloem
d.
Movement of solutes up the xylem and
movement of water up and down the phloem

89. During a severe drought, the soil becomes dry and its
water potential decreases. Many plants will wilt in such an
environment. Consider that the overall water potential for
a system is represented by the equation: Ψsystem = Ψtotal
= Ψs + Ψp + Ψg + Ψm What is one reason that plants are
unable to draw water from the soil?
a.
The water potential of the soil becomes lower
than the water potential of the plants.
b.
The water potential of the soil becomes lower
than the solute potential
