3.7 ▶ Limiting Reactants Recognize that 
one reactant may be used up before others 
in a chemical reaction. This is the limiting

The bubbles released when baking soda reacts with an acid play an 
important role in baking, where the release of gaseous CO2 causes the 
dough in your biscuits or the batter in your pancakes to rise. An alterna-
tive way to produce CO2 in cooking is to use yeasts that rely on chemical 
reactions to convert sugar into CO2, ethanol, and other organic com-
