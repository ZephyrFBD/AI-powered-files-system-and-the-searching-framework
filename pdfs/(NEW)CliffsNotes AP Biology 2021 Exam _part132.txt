thase, a channel protein in the inner membrane, allows the protons in the
intermembrane compartment to flow back into the matrix. The protons moving through the channel generate the
energy for ATP synthase to generate ATP. It is similar to how a dam generates electricity when water passing
through turbines forces them to turn.

How Many ATP?
How many ATP can theoretically be made from the energy released from the breakdown of 1 glucose molecule? In
the cytoplasm, 1 glucose produces 2 NADH, 2 ATP, and 2 pyruvate during glycolysis. When the 2 pyruvate (from 1
glucose) are converted to 2 acetyl CoA, 2 more NADH are produced. From 2 acetyl CoA, the Krebs cycle produces
6 NADH, 2
FADH2, and 2 ATP. If each NADH produces 3 ATP during oxidative phosphorylation, and FADH2produces 2
ATP, the total ATP count from 1
original glucose molecule appears to be 38. However, this number is reduced to 36 because the 2 NADH that are
produced in the cytoplasm during glycolysis must be transported
