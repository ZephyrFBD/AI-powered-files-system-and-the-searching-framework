*23. (III) Suppose the force acting on a tennis ball (mass
0.060 kg) points in the 
direction and is given by the
graph of Fig. 7–33 as a function of time. (a) Use graphical
methods (count squares) to estimate the total impulse given
the ball. (b) Estimate the
velocity of the ball after
being struck, assuming
the ball is being served
so it is nearly at rest
initially.

24. (III) (a) Calculate the impulse experienced when a 55-kg
person lands on firm ground after jumping from a height
of 2.8 m. (b) Estimate the average force exerted on the
person’s feet by the ground if the landing is stiff-legged,
and again (c) with bent legs. With stiff legs, assume the
body moves 1.0
