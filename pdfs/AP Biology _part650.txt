Carry blood away from
the heart under enormous
pressures
Walls made of thick, elastic, smooth muscle

Vein and
Venule
Carry blood back to the
heart under very little
pressure
Thin walls have valves to help preventback flow; veins are
located within skeletal muscle, which propels blood upward and
back to the heart as the body moves
Capillary
Allows for diffusion of
