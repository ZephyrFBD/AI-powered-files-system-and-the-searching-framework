 
extinction coefficient (a characteristic of the substance being 
monitored at a given wavelength of light), b is the path length 
through which the light passes, and c is the molar concen-
tration of the absorbing substance. Thus, the concentration 
is directly proportional to absorbance. Many chemical and 
pharmaceutical companies routinely use Beer’s law to calcu-
late the concentration of puriﬁed solutions of the compounds 
that they make. In the laboratory portion of your course, you 
may very well perform one or more experiments in which you 
use Beer’s law to relate absorption of light to concentration.
