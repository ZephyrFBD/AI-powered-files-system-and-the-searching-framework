visual cortex.
a.
Some signals go to the temporal lobe, which
detects “where” information, and other signals
go to the parietal lobe, which detects “where”
and “what” signals.
b.
Some signals go to the parietal lobe, which
detects “where” information, and other signals
go to the temporal lobe, which detects “what”
signals.
c.
Some signals go to the parietal lobe, which
detects “where” and “what” information and
other signals go to the temporal lobe, which also
detects “where” and “what” signals.
d.
Some signals go to the parietal lobe, which
detects “where” information, and other signals
go to the temporal lobe, which detects “where”
and “what” signals.

57. Odorants are mixtures of many different molecules.
The complexity of the human sense of smell can be
represented visually as a grid of 100 cells (10 x 10 grid)
with each cell associated with a unique molecule-receptor
pair. An odorant is detected when the brain integrates the
signals generated by
