 Human cells divide every day for normal growth, replacement of cells, and tissue repair. The dividing cells 
proceed through the three phases of the cell cycle as shown in the figure. When a person experiences a cut, 
damaged skin cells secrete a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF). Epidermal (skin) cells in the vicinity 
of the injury 
 possess proteins in their cell membranes called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)  
(a)  Identify the THREE major stages of interphase, and describe the sequence in which they occur. 
(b)  Describe the most likely role of EGF and the role of EGFR in a cell signaling pathway. Describe how 
the cellular response to EGF results in tissue repair. 
(c) Cancer can result from disruptions in cell cycle control. Mutations that increase the production of EGFR 
have been associated with skin cancer of the head and neck. Describe how a mutation outside of the coding 
 
region of a gene that encodes EGFR could lead to the overpr
