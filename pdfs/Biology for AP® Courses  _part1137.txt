Exercise 10.1
A. A comparison of the relative time intervals of mitotic stages can be made by completing the task described. In
evaluating each time interval, the problem suggests that you assume that the length of time to complete one cell cycle
is 24 hours. How can that assumption be tested?

Suppose that you have a growth chamber in which roots of a newly germinated plant can be examined visually with
a lens that provides a magnification from which lengths can be determined with a precision of ± 0.05 mm. The field
of view can be rotated so that measurements can be made of both the length and diameter of the growing tip. A large
number of growing roots can be studied. Tips can be sampled, sectioned, and examined microscopically with a 25×
magnification so that estimates of t
