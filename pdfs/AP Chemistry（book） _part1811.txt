d ice are in equilibrium under 1 atm 
of air? Explain.
 11.59  Referring to Figure 11.28, describe all the phase changes 
that would occur in each of the following cases: (a) Water 
vapor originally at 0.005 atm and -0.5 °C is slowly com-
pressed at constant temperature until the ﬁnal pressure 
is 20 atm. (b) Water originally at 100.0 °C and 0.50 atm 
is cooled at constant pressure until the temperature is 
-10 °C.
 11.60  Referring to Figure 11.29, describe the phase changes (and 
the temperatures at which they occur) when CO2 is heated 
from -80 to -20 °C at (a) a constant pressure of 3 atm, 
 
(b) a constant pressure of 6 atm.
