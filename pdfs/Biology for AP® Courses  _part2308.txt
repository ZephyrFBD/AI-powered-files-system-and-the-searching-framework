s are mammals and fish are
not, thus their evolutionary paths are quite
separate. They have similar body shapes because
of their similar environment.
b.
Analogous-Dolphins and fish are both
vertebrates, thus they share an evolutionary
history, causing them to have similar body
shapes.
c.
Homologous-Dolphins and fish are both
vertebrates, thus they have a similar recent
evolutionary history, causing them to have
similar body shapes.
d.
Homologous-Dolphins are mammals and fish
are not, thus their evolutionary paths are quite
separate. They have similar body shapes because
of their similar environment.
37. What effect has the advancement of DNA technology
had on determining phylogeny?
a.
Morphologic and molecular information often
disagree.
b.
Scientists are struggling with molecular
systematics.
c.
Information is not reliable because organisms
appear to be closely related when they are not.
d.
Computer programs help determine relatedness
using DNA sequencing, and morphologic and
molecula
