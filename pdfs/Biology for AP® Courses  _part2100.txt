Genetics, 2003). Explain
how such a molecular clock could be refined to infer time
for the evolution of prokaryotes.

B. Using a molecular clock constructed from 32 conserved
proteins, Hedges and colleagues (Battistuzzi et al., BMC
Evol. Biol. 2004) estimated the times during which key
biological processes evolved. A diagram based on their
work is shown. Connect the time of the origin of life
inferred from this diagram with the age of the oldest fossil
stromatolites and the age of the oldest exposed rock to
show how evidence from different scientific disciplines
provides support for the concept of evolution. Evaluate
the legitimacy of claims drawn from these different
disciplines (biology, geology, and mathematics) regarding
the origin of life on Earth.

The oldest known rocks are exposed at three locations:
Greenland, Australia, and Swaziland. The following
application of mathematical methods provides the essential
evidence of the minimum age of Earth. The math
