Understand BLAST scoring. Most phylogenic trees are constructed by examining nucleotide sequences; the
more identical two speciesâ€™ sequences are for a specific gene, the more closely related they are. BLAST is able
to analyze different sequences to tell you how similar they are to one another based on a score. The higher the
score, the closer the two sequences align.
LAB 4: DIFFUSION AND OSMOSIS
This lab investigates the process of diffusion and osmosis in a semipermeable membrane as well as the effects of
solute concentration and water potential on these processes.
What are the general concepts you really need to know?
Fortunately, this lab covers the same concepts about diffusion and osmosis that are discussed in this book. Just
remember that osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane, from a region of high water
concentration to one of low water concentration, or from a hypotonic region (low solute concentration) to a
hypertonic region (high solute co
