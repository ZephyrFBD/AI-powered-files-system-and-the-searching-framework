you need to identify how the investigation aligns with concepts and science practices 
outlined in the curriculum framework. You should consider what prior knowledge and 
skills students must have to perform the investigation, what skills the lab develops, and 
how the investigation connects back to and builds upon concepts that the student has 
studied previously. 
You also should provide students with guidelines and/or procedures for using 
particular instruments and equipment. This can be accomplished through prelab 
demonstrations, online tutorials, or other appropriate methods. In addition, you must 
consider any safety and housekeeping issues, and determine if the school has resources 
(e.g., materials, supplies, computers, or other equipment) to conduct a particular 
investigation. The following table is useful for identifying components and challenges 
when creating a new student-directed, inquiry-based lab or modifying a familiar one.
