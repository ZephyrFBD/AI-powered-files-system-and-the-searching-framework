Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a worldwide health
problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, over 80,000 invasive MRSA (methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus) infections and 12,000 related deaths occur
every year in the United States. What is causing the rapid
development and spread of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus
bacteria?
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can exchange genetic material with
nonresistant bacteria and spread resistance.
A spontaneous mutation in the DNA of millions of bacteria
caused this increase in methicillin resistance.
Normal Staphylococcus bacteria can outcompete antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.
