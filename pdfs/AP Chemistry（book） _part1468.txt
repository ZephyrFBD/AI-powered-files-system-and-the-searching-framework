the arrangements of its electrons. Molecules with one or more unpaired electrons are at-
tracted to a magnetic field. The more unpaired electrons in a species, the stronger the 
attractive force. This type of magnetic behavior is called paramagnetism.

CHAPTER 9 Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
Substances with no unpaired electrons are weakly repelled by a magnetic field. This 
property is called diamagnetism. The distinction between paramagnetism and dia-
magnetism is nicely illustrated in an older method for measuring magnetic properties 
(Figure 9.44). It involves weighing the substanc
