tors, or physiological
incompatibility of gametes. Postzygotic barriers include ultimate
inviability or sterility of hybrid organisms from the interbreeding of two
species. Hybrid organisms may not die oﬀ in one generation, but
ultimately the oﬀspring of the mating of two species will die without
producing oﬀspring of their own.
Geographic isolation is not the only factor that can cause speciation, so
additional terms have been defined to describe how species evolve due
to isolating mechanisms. Allopatric speciation is when one population is
separated into two distinct populations by some geographic barrier
such as the movement of a tectonic plate or the elevation of a mountain
range. Aȇer the original population is no longer able to share its alleles, it
evolves into distinct populations that have a high probability of acquiring
distinctive traits. In contrast, sympatric speciation occurs when
individuals within a population acquire distinctively diﬀerent traits while
in the same geog
