ematics is
appropriate for students who have completed a second
year of algebra. However, it is not illustrative of the type
of item that could appear on the AP Biology Exam.
The exposed rocks contain a radioactive isotope of
rubidium, 87Rb, which decays into a stable isotope of
strontium, 87Sr. An 87Rb atom with 37 protons and 50
neutrons decays when a proton is converted into a neutron
to produce an atom, 87Sr, with 36 protons and 51 neutrons.
As time passed, the number of each isotope changed from
its initial value. When a crystal containing 87Rb atoms
formed from the molten surface of the hot, early Earth
during the Hadean eon, the number of these atoms at that
initial time can be represented as N87Rb,0. As time passed,
the number of atoms of this isotope changed to N87Rb.
C. Justify the relationship between the number of each
isotope at any time and the number of each at the time that
the molten rock solidified (denoted by the subscript 0):
N87Sr = N87Sr, 0 + N87Rb, 0 âˆ’N87Rb
