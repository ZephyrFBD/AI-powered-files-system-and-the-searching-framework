t students will comprehend that substances move from an area of high 
concentration to an area of low concentration but fail to realize that the diffusion rate is 
based on the concentration differences. Many students confuse concentration with the 
amount of a solution. A human skin cell in normal (isotonic) saline will not change its 
shape regardless of the amount of saline around it. 
Students also think that molecules stop moving at equilibrium. This is not the case. 
Diffusion reaches a dynamic equilibrium, not a static equilibrium. 
Water potential is a difficult concept for students to grasp. For students lacking 
sufficient mathematical skills, you likely will need to provide guidance as they work 
through the information and calculations on water potential. Solutes effectively prevent 
water from diffusing because the water is no longer “free.” Solutes are surrounded 
by hydration shells and reduce the concentration of water. Students have difficulty 
understanding how walled
