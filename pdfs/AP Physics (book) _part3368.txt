We can write decay as

What, you may wonder, is the difference between a 
ray and an X-ray? They
both are electromagnetic radiation (photons) and, though 
rays usually have
higher energy than X-rays, their range of energies overlap to some extent. The
difference is not intrinsic. We use the term X-ray if the phot
