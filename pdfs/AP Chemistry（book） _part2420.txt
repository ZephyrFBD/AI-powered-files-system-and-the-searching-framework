ction would proceed in the 
opposite direction (from right to left) if the container volume 
were reduced sufficiently. (b) The reaction would proceed 
in the opposite direction if the container volume were ex-
panded sufficiently. (c) The direction of this reaction does 
not depend on the volume of the container.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
At 1000 K, the value of Kp for the reaction 2 SO31g2 ∆  
2 SO21g2 + O21g2 is 0.338. Calculate the value for Q p, and 
predict the direction in which the reaction proceeds toward 
equilibrium if the initial partial pressures are P
SO3 = 0.16 atm;  
P
SO2 = 0.41 atm; P
O2 = 2.5 atm.
For the Haber process, N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2, Kp = 1.45 * 10-5, at 500 °C. In an equilibrium mixture of the three 
gases at 500 °C, the partial pressure of H2 is 0.928 atm and that of N2 is 0.432 atm. What is the partial pressure of NH3 in this 
equilibrium mixture?
