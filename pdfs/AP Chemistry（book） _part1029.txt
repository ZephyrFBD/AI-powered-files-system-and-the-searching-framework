 an 
approximate distance of 3 Å from the nucleus.  (b) The radial 
probability function shown here and the probability density 
[c1r2]2 both go to zero at the same distance from the nucleus, 
approximately 1 Å. (c) For an s orbital, the number of radial 
nodes is equal to the principal quantum number, n.
 6.55  (a) For n = 4, what are the possible values of l? (b) For l = 2, 
what are the possible values of ml? (c) If ml is 2, what are the 
possible values for l?

and ml are there when (a) n = 3, (b) n = 4?

CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
 6.57  Give the numerical values of n and l corresponding to each of 
the following orbital designations: (a) 3p, (b) 2s, (c) 4f, (d) 5d.
 6.58  Give the values for n, l, and ml for (a) each orbital in the 2p 
subshell, (b) each orbital in the 5d subshell.
 6.59  A certain orbital of the hydrogen atom has n = 4 and 
l = 2. (a) What are the possible values of ml for this orbital
