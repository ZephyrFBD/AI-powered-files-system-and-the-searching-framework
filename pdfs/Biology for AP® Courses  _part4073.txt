f the hormones FSH and LH. In addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles. Estrogen
is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also
responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a
shorter period necessary for bone maturation. Progesterone assists in endometrial re-growth and inhibition of FSH and LH
release.
In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. Follicle cells
produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits FSH production. LH also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of
ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. Estradiol and progesterone are steroid
hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. Estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both
estradiol and
