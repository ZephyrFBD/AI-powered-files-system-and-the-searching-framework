24–8 Interference in Thin Films
Interference of light gives rise to many everyday phenomena such as the bright
colors reflected from soap bubbles and from thin oil or gasoline films on water,
Fig. 24–29. In these and other cases, the colors are a result of constructive interfer-
ence between light reflected from the two surfaces of the thin film. The effect is
observed only if the thickness of the film is on the order of the wavelength of the light.
If the film thickness is greater than a few wavelengths, the effect gets washed out.

To see how this thin-film interference happens, consider a smooth surface of
water on top of which is a thin uniform layer of an
