ine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less important in
most freshwater lakes.
The ocean is categorized by several areas or zones (Figure 35.21). All of the oceanâ€™s open water is referred to as the pelagic
realm (or zone). The benthic realm (or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of
the ocean floor. Within the pelagic realm is the photic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate
(approximately 200 m or 650 ft). At depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as the aphotic
zone. The majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. The deepest part of the ocean, the
Challenger Deep (in the Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. To
give some perspective on the depth of this trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep. These realms a
