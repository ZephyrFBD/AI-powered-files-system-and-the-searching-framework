Questions 23â€“26 refer to the following passage.
Proteins often need the equivalent of a shipping label so that they can be sent intracellularly or extracellularly to
the correct location. These labels are typically found in three forms: signal sequences, target signals, or localization
signals. A signal sequence is a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residue that is only located within polypeptides
destined to fold into EITHER extracellular proteins, intermembrane proteins that will anchor to the cell surface, or
proteins that will be members of the secretory pathway that packs and ships things towards the cell surface. A
targeting signal is a sequence that identifies the proteins of the secretory pathway. A localization signal is a sequence
that labels proteins that are destined to go to specific organelles (that are not part of the secretory pathway). The
table below shows seven eukaryotic proteins, and the sequences have been identified in each.
