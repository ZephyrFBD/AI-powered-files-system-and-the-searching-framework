mL of 0.100 M HCl to 
20.0 mL of 0.100 M NH3.
Calculate the pH at the equivalence point in the titration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M  CH3COOH with 0.100 M  NaOH.
Sample Exercise 17.9 
Calculating the pH at the Equivalence Point
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the pH at the equivalence point 
of the titration of a weak acid with a strong base. Because the neu-
tralization of a weak acid produces its anion, a conjugate base that 
can react with water, we expect the pH at the equivalence point to 
be greater than 7.
Plan The initial number of moles of acetic acid equals the number 
of moles of acetate ion at the equivalence point. We use the vol-
ume of the solution at the equivalence point to calculate the con-
centration of acetate ion. Because the acetate ion is a weak base, 
we can calculate the pH using Kb and 3CH3COO-4.
Solve 
The number of moles of acetic acid in the initial solution is 
obtained from the volume and molarity of the solution:
Moles = M * V = 10.100 mol>L210.050
