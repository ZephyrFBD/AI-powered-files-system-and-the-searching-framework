her sex, with members who seem stronger or healthier
being more likely to produce offspring that will survive. Many bird behaviors involve mate choice. Birds may
choose mates based on coloration, bird songs, mating dances, or nesting behaviors. An example of this is seen in
Pavo cristatus (the peacock). Peacocks with brighter plumage are more likely to attract mates than their counterparts
with duller plumage. Female members of Sula nebouxii, the blue-footed booby bird, select mates with the brightest
blue feet. Younger males have brighter blue feet and are more likely to have higher fertility.
In intrasexual selection, members of one sex compete for mates of the other sex. This may involve asserting
dominance to ward off competitors and gain better access to mates.
