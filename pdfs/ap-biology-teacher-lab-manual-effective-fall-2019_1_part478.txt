view, count the cells in each phase. Repeat the counts in two other 
root tips. 
4. Collect the class data for each group, and calculate the mean and standard deviation 
for each group. You must make a table in your notebook for the class data. 
5. Compare the number of cells from each group in interphase and in mitosis.

1. For this experiment, the number of treated cells in interphase and mitosis will be the 
observed (o) values. 
2. To find out what your expected values are, complete the following steps: 
a. Calculate the percentage of cells in interphase and mitosis in the control group 
from Table 1. 
b. Multiply the percentages by the total number of cells in the treated group; this will 
give the expected numbers (e). 
3. Calculate the chi-square (Ï‡2) value for the test. 
4. Compar
