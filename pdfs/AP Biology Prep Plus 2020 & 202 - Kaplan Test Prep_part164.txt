suppose a plant cell is placed in an open container of 0.1 M
NaCl solution at 25°C. What would the water potential be?
The solute potential can be calculated using the equation:
ΨS = –iCRT
Substituting in the appropriate values,
Because it is an open container, the pressure potential is equal to 0.
Therefore, the water potential is:
A negative water potential means that water is likely to osmose out of the
cell from a place of high water potential to a place of low water potential.

Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all known
living organisms. There are two major types: prokaryotic cells
and eukaryotic cells.
1.
Prokaryotic cells have no real nucleus, have circular DNA, and
reproduce using binary fission. Prokaryotes include archaea
and bacteria. These cells are small and move via flagella.
2.
Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, linear DNA, highly structured
cell membranes, and organelles, and they reproduc
