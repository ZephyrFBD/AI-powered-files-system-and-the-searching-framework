l energy. As it is pulled up the first hill, its gravitational
potential energy increases and reaches a maximum at the top. As it descends the
other side, its potential energy decreases and reaches a local minimum at the
bottom of the hill. As the roller coaster continues on its up and down path, its poten-
tial energy goes through more changes. But when it arrives back at the starting
point, it has exactly as much potential energy as it had when it started at this point.
Another way of saying this is that there was as much uphill as there was downhill.
Similar reasoning can be applied to an electric circuit. We will analyze the circuit
of Fig.19–11 shortly, but first we consider the simpler circuit in Fig.19–12. We have
chosen it to be the same as the equivalent circuit of Fig. 19–7b already discussed.
The current in this circuit is 
as we calculated in
Example 19–4. (We keep an extra digit in I to reduce rounding errors.) The positive
side of the battery, point e in Fig. 19–12a, is a
