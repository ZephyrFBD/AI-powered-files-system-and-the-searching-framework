might account for the variations in maximal jaw angle?
(A) Different wind speeds on each island
(B) Different heights of trees on each island
(C) Different sizes of seeds on each island
(D) Differences in altitude on each island
19. If the mice from Island A and the mice from Island B were placed together, what would likely happen?
(A) The mice would mate, but it is impossible to predict jaw angle.
(B) The mice would mate, and the jaw angle would be approximately 27°.
(C) The mice would mate, and the jaw angle would be either 21° or 32°.
(D) The mice would not be capable of mating.
20. Skeletons have been found that indicate that mice with jaw angles less than 30 degrees were once found on
Island B. Which explanation best accounts for this?
(A) A small jaw angle hinders the survival of mice on Island B.
(B) A large jaw angle hinders the survival of mice on Island A.
(C) A small jaw angle encourages the survival of mice on Island C.
(D) A large jaw angle encourages the survival of mice
