Introduction
The plasma membrane, which is also called the cell membrane, has many functions; but, the most basic one is to define the
borders and act as gatekeeper for the cell. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable, meaning some molecules can
freely enter or leave the cell. Others require help from specialized structures, other molecules, or require energy in order to
cross. One example of a molecule that assists other molecules across the plasma membrane is a protein called NPC1. This
protein is involved in moving cholesterol and other types of fats across the plasma membrane. Some people have a genetic
condition resulting in improperly functioning NPC1. As a result, excessive cholesterol accumulates wi
