Plates 1 and 3
Which of the following statements explains why there was no
growth on Plate 3?
The heat shock method, which was used to make the E. coli
competent, killed the bacteria.
Those particular E. coli bacteria were inhibited from growing
by the nutrient in the agar.
Those bacteria were not transformed.
The bacteria died because they have a short life span.
Which of the following statements best explains why there were
fewer colonies on Plate 1 than on Plate 2?
The bacteria on Plate 2 did not transform.
There was no antibiotic in the agar on Plate 2 that would have
restricted the growth of the bacteria.
The transformation of bacteria on Plate 2 was more suc
