ndulum does not depend
on the amplitude (like any SHM, Section 11–3), as long as the amplitude is small.
Galileo is said to have first noted this fact while watching a swinging lamp in the
cathedral at Pisa (Fig. 11–13). This discovery led to the invention of the pendulum
clock, the first really precise timepiece, which became the standard for centuries.
