r version (blue) for each investigation 
includes the enduring understandings and science practices that align to the learning 
objectives outlined in the curriculum framework; you are encouraged to use this 
model when you develop your own student-directed, inquiry-based investigations. 
Each investigation provides suggestions for prelab assessments that are designed to 
determine students’ prior understanding, knowledge of key concepts, and skills. Each 
lab investigation also provides suggestions for summative assessments, which measure 
students’ understanding of the concepts, development of science practices, and gain in 
thinking skills after they conduct their lab investigations and analyze their results. 
The primary question(s) for students 
to investigate is generated from the 
enduring understandings in the AP 
Biology Curriculum Framework.
