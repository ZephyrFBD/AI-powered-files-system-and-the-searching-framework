51. What is an anabolic pathway? Which of these is an
example of an anabolic pathway used by cells in their
metabolism?
a.
Anabolic pathways involve the breakdown of
nutrient molecules into usable forms. An
example is the harvesting of amino acids from
dietary proteins.
b.
Anabolic pathways involve the breakdown of
nutrient molecules into useable forms. An
example is the use of glycogen by the liver to
maintain blood glucose levels.
c.
Anabolic pathways build new molecules out of
the products of catabolic pathways. An example
is the separation of fatty acids from triglycerides
to sati
