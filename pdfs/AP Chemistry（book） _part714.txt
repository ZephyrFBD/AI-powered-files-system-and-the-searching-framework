hich applies to processes occurring at constant pressure.
The units of work obtained by using Equation 5.7 will be those of pressure (usually 
atm) multiplied by those of volume (usually L). To express the work in the more familiar 
unit of joules, we use the conversion factor 1 L@atm = 101.3 J.

If we define the system as the reactants and products, what is 
the sign of work in this process, positive or negative?
H2 gas
plus original
atmosphere
Zn(s)
HCl(aq)
Piston
Zn(s)
HCl(aq)
Zn(s) 1 2 H1(aq)
Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)
Increase in volume means system
does pressure–volume work.

Give It Some Thought
If a system does not change its volume during the course of a process, does it do 
pressure–volume work?

Sample Exercise 5.2
Calculating Pressure-Volume Work    
A fuel is burned in a cylinder equipped with a piston. The initial volume of the cylinder is 0.250 L, and the final volume is  
0.980 L. I
