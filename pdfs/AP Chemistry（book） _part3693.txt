ice to supple-
ment infant formula with iron sometime during the ﬁrst year of life. 
However, iron supplements are not necessary for infants who breast-
feed because breast milk contains two specialized proteins, lactofer-
rin and transferrin, which provide sufficient iron while denying its 
availability to bacteria. Even for infants fed with infant formulas, sup-
plementing with iron during the ﬁrst several months of life may be 
ill-advised.
For bacteria to continue to multiply in the blood, they must 
synthesize new supplies of siderophores. Synthesis of siderophores 
in bacteria slows, however, as the temperature is increased above the 
normal body temperature of 37 °C and stops completely at 40 °C. This 
suggests that fever in the presence of an invading microbe is a mecha-
nism used by the body to deprive bacteria of iron.
