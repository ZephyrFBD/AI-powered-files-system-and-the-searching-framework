h as transcription, 
translation, and glycolysis. Because these genes appear to be expressed in all cells at constant levels, the 
expression of housekeeping genes is often used as a control when comparing how the expression of other 
genes varies under different conditions. 
Researchers studying the effect of pesticides on declining bee populations wanted to determine whether the 
expression of four housekeeping genes (GAPDH, RPL32, RPS5, and TBP-AF) was in fact constant in bees across 
different variables. The researchers collected samples of mRNA for each of the four genes and compared 
how their expression varied across the developmental stage of the bee, the sex of the bee, and the cell type 
from which the sample was taken. The mRNA from the samples was reverse transcribed to produce DNA 
copies of each gene. PCR was then used to amplify the DNA, and the Cq value was determined. The Cq value 
is the number of PCR cycles needed to produce a specified number of DNA copies (Figure 1
