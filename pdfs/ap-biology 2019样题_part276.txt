Science Practice 2: Analyze visual representations of biological 
concepts and processes. 
Visual representations are indispensable tools for 
learning and exploring scientific concepts and ideas. 
Students should create and use representations 
to illustrate biological processes and concepts, 
communicate information, make predictions, and 
describe systems to demonstrate their understanding. 
Students should also use and apply visual 
representations to make predictions and address 
scientific questions, as well as interpret and create 
graphs drawn from experimental data.
