r kidneyâ€”that have specific, specialized functions within the body. Organs are organized into organ
systems to perform functions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and
the digestive system, consisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. Organ systems
come together to create an entire organism.
Epithelial Tissues
Epithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer
or multiple layers of cells. The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of
cells. Epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers
is called stratified epithelia. Table 24.2 summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues.
