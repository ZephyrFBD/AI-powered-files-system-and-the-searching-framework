ple, if the gas in Fig. 15–5 expands very slowly against the piston, the work done
by the gas to raise the piston is the force F times the distance d. But the force 
is just the pressure P of the gas times the area A of the piston,
Thus,
Note that
the change in volume of the gas, so
[constant pressure] (15;3)
Equation 15–3 also holds if the gas is compressed at constant pressure, in which
case 
is negative (since V decreases); W is then negative, which indicates 
that work is done on the gas. Equation 15–3 is also valid for liquids and solids,
as long as the pressure is constant during the process.
In an isovolumetric process (Fig. 15–4b) the volume does not change, so no
work is done, W = 0.
