housed at Yerkes Observatory in
Wisconsin. The objective lens is
102 cm (40 inches) in diameter, and
the telescope tube is about 19 m
long. Example 25–8.

telescope has a 1.2-cm focal length eyepiece. What is the focal
length of the objective lens?
For an astronomical telescope to produce bright images of faint stars, the
objective lens must be large to allow in as much light as possible. Indeed, the diam-
eter of the objective lens (and hence its “light-gathering power”) is an important
parameter for an astronomical telescope, which is why the largest ones are specified
by giving the objective diameter (such as the 10-meter Keck telescope in Hawaii).
The construction and grinding of large lenses is very difficult. Therefore, the
largest teles
