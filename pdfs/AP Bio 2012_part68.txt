 1. Use the graph above to calculate the mean rate of  
population growth (individuals per day) between 
day 3 and day 5. Give your answer to the nearest 
whole number.  
 
 2. In a certain species of flowering plant, the purple 
allele P is dominant to the yellow allele p.  
 
  A student performed a cross between a purple-
flowered plant and a yellow-flowered plant. When 
planted, the 146 seeds that were produced from

  Calculate the chi-squared value for the null 
hypothesis that the purple-flowered parent was 
heterozygous for the flower-co
