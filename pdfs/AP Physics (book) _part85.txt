Introduction, Measurement, Estimating
Length
The first truly international standard was the meter (abbreviated m) established
as the standard of length by the French Academy of Sciences in the 1790s. The
standard meter was originally chosen to be one ten-millionth of the distance
from the Earth’s equator to either pole,† and a platinum rod to represent this
length was made. (One meter is, very roughly, the distance from the tip of your
nose to the tip of your finger, with arm and hand stretched out horizontally.) In
1889, the meter was defined more precisely as the distance between two finely
engraved marks on a particular bar of platinum–iridium alloy. In 1960, to
provide even greater precision and reproducibility, the meter was redefined as
1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a particular orange light emitted by the gas
krypton-86. In 1983 the me
