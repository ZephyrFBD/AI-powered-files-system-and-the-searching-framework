ids consist of cations and 
anions held together by electrostatic attractions. Because these inter-
actions are quite strong, ionic compounds tend to have high melt-
ing points. The attractions become stronger as the charges of the 
ions increase and/or the sizes of the ions decrease. The presence of 
both attractive (cation–anion) and repulsive (cation–cation and 
anion–anion) interactions helps to explain why ionic compounds 
are brittle. Like metals, the structures of ionic compounds tend to 
be symmetric, but to minimize direct contact between ions of like 
charge, the coordination numbers (typically 4 to 8) are necessarily 
smaller than those seen in close-packed metals. The exact structure 
depends on the relative sizes of the ions and the cation-to-anion 
ratio in the empirical formula.
MOLECULAR SOLIDS (SECTION 12.6) Molecular solids consist of 
atoms or molecules held together by intermolecular forces. Because 
these forces are relatively weak, molecular solids tend to be soft
