sses through two 
parallel slits and falls on a screen 5.0 m away. Adjacent bright
bands of the interference pattern are 2.0 cm apart. (a) Find
the distance between the slits. (b) The same two slits are
next illuminated by light of a different wavelength, and the
fifth-order minimum for this light occurs at the same point
on the screen as the fourth-order minimum for the previous
light. What is the wavelength of the second source of light?
5.0 * 10â€“7 m
74. Television and radio waves reflecting from mountains or
airplanes can interfere with the direct signal from the 
station. (a) What kind of interference will occur when 
75-MHz television signals arrive at a receiver directly from
a distant station, and are reflected from a nearby airplane
122 m directly above the receiver? Assume 
change in
phase of the signal upon reflection. (b) What kind of inter-
ference will occur if the plane is 22 m closer to the receiver?
