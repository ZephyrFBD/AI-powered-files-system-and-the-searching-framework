flected pulses plotted as a 
function of time when received by 
transducer. The vertical dashed lines 
point out which reflected pulse goes 
with which surface. (c) “Dot display”
for the same echoes: brightness of 
each dot is related to signal strength.

The detection of reflected pulses by the same transducer can then be displayed on
the screen of a display monitor. The time elapsed from when the pulse is 
emitted to when each reflection (echo) is received is proportional to the distance 
to the reflecting surface. For example, if the distance from the transducer to the
vertebra is 25 cm, the pulse travels a round-trip distance of
The speed of sound in human tissue is about 
(close to that of sea water),
so the time taken is
The strength of a reflected pulse depends mainly on the difference in density
of the two materials on either side of the interface and can be displayed as a pulse
or as a dot (Figs. 12–27b and c). Each echo d
