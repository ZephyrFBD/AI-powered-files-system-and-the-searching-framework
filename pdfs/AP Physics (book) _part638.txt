ot to scale.)
5. Is mechanical energy conserved? If no friction or
other nonconservative forces act, then conservation
of mechanical energy holds:
(6;12a)
6. Apply conservation of energy. If friction (or other
nonconservative forces) are present, then an addi-
tional term 
will be needed:
(6;10)
For a constant friction force acting over a distance d
(6;16b)
For other nonconservative forces use your intuition
for the sign of 
is the total mechanical energy
increased or decreased in the process?

Conservation of Energy
1. Draw a picture of the physical situation.
2. Determine the system for which you will apply energy
conservation: the object or objects and the forces
acting.
3. Ask yourself what quantity you are looking for, and
choose initial (point 1) and final (point 2) positions.
4. If the object under
