Solve The first member of the halogen group is fluorine (F
, ele-
ment 9). Moving backward from F, we find that the noble-gas core 
is [He]. Moving from He to the element of next higher atomic 
number brings us to Li, element 3. Because Li is in the second 
period of the s block, we add electrons to the 2s subshell. Moving 
across this block gives 2s2. Continuing to move to the right, we 
enter the p block. Counting the squares to F gives 2p5. Thus, the 
condensed electron configuration for fluorine is
F: 3He42s22p5
The electron configuration for chlorine, the second halogen, is
Cl: 3Ne43s23p5
From these two examples, we see that the characteristic valence 
electron configuration of a halogen is ns2np5, where n ranges from 
2 in the case of fluorine to 6 in the case of astatine.
