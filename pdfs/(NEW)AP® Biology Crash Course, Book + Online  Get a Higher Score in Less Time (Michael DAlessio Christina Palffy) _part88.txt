e female’s X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in order to have the
same gene dosage as males for sex chromosomes. The chromosome tends to look smaller in
physical structure. Example of the phenotypic output of X-inactivation are calico-colored cats.
Practicing a variety of genetics problems is an essential test preparation activity for the AP® Biology exam. Some genetics problems
provide information about parents and ask about phenotypic ratios of their progeny; others give information about progeny and ask
about the parents’ genotypes or phenotypes. Be prepared for both. Be sure to practice pedigree problems involving dominant,
recessive, and sex-linked traits.

DNA Structure and Replication
I.
Key Concepts
A. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)—genetic material
B. The structure of a DNA molecule is the key to understanding how each strand of DNA can act as a
template for the replication of the other strand during DNA replication and for the
