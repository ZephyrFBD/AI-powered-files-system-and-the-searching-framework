on light. Instead, it uses
the products of the light reactions: ATP and NADPH.

The Calvin cycle, like the light-dependent reactions, occurs only in
the light.
STUDY TIP
Your teacher may want you to know this for class, but you will not see all these details on the
AP exam. You do, however, need to understand how the Calvin cycle works.
Figure 7.8 The Calvin Cycle
PHOTORESPIRATION
In most plants, CO2 enters the Calvin cycle and is fixed into 3-
phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) by the enzyme rubisco. These plants are
called C-3 plants because the first step produces the compound 3-PGA,
which contains three carbons. This first step is not very efficient because
rubisco can also bind with O2 as well as with CO2. When rubisco binds

with O2 instead of CO2, this process, photorespiration, diverts the process
of photosynthesis in two ways.
Unlike normal respiration, no ATP is produced.
Unlike normal photo
