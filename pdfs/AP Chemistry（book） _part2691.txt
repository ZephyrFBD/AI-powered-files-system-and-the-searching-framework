king the negative logarithm of both sides of Equation 17.5, we have
-log3H+4 = -logaKa
3HA4
3A-4 b = -logKa - log 
3HA4
3A-4
Because -log3H+4 = pH and -logKa = pKa, we have
 
pH = pKa - log 
3HA4
3A-4 = pKa + log 
3A-4
3HA4

(Remember the logarithm rules in Appendix A.2, if you are not sure how this calculation 
works.)
In general,
 
pH = pKa + log 
3base4
3acid4 
[17.9]
where [acid] and [base] refer to the equilibrium concentrations of the conjugate acid–base 
pair. Note that when 3base4 = 3acid4, we have pH = pKa.
Equation 17.9 is known as the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. Biologists, 
 
biochemists, and others who work frequently with buffers often use this equation to cal-
culate the pH of buffers. In doing equilibrium calculations, we have seen that we can nor-
mally neglect the amounts of the acid and  base of the buffer that ionize. Therefore, we 
can usually use the initial concentrations of the acid and base components of the buffer 
directly in Equation 17.9, as seen
