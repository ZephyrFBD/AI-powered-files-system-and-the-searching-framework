rved some of it.
(b) Heavier unstable isotopes decay into it.
(c) It is created in lightning strikes.
(d) It is replenished by cosmic rays.
(e) Its half-life has increased over time.
(f) Its half-life has decreased over time.
15. How does an atom’s nucleus stay together and remain
stable?
(a) The attractive gravitational force between the protons
and neutrons overcomes the repulsive electrostatic
force between the protons.
(b) Having just the right number of neutrons overcomes
the electrostatic force between the protons.
(c) A strong covalent bond develops between the neutrons
and protons, because they are so close to each other.
(d) None of the above.
16. What has greater mass?
(a) A neutron and a proton that are far from each other
(unbound).
(b) A neutron and a proton that are bound together in a
hydrogen (deuterium) nucleus.
(c) Both the same.
