erted to various substances that enter
intermediate steps of glycolysis or the Krebs cycle.
Fats are storage molecules for energy so they, too, can be sources of free energy. Glycerol and fatty acids are
obtained from fats by hydrolysis or by the digestion of fats that are eaten. After enzymatic conversions, glycerol
enters glycolysis and fatty acids enter the Krebs cycle (as acetyl CoA).
Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the decomposition (lysis) of glucose (glyco) to pyruvate (or pyruvic acid). The steps are summarized
here and in Figure 4-3. For each molecule of glucose:
 
1. 2 ATP are added. The first several steps require the input of ATP. This changes glucose in preparation for
subsequent steps.
 
2. 2 NADH are produced. NADH, a coenzyme, is an electron carrier
 
when NAD+ combines with two energy-rich electrons and H+ (obtained
 
from an intermediate molecule during the breakdown of glucose). As a result, NADH is an energy-rich molecule.
3. 4 ATP are produced by substrate-level phosphory
