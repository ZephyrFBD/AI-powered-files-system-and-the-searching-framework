[*Gauss’s law states that the total flux summed over any
closed surface (considered as made up of many small areas

Gauss’s law can be used to determine the electric field due to
given charge distributions, but its usefulness is mainly limited to
cases where the charge distribution displays much symmetry. The
real importance of Gauss’s law is that it is a general and elegant
statement of the relation between electric charge and electric field.]

Summary
This last Example also gives us the field between the two parallel plates we
discussed in Fig. 16–32d. If the plates are large compared to their separation,
then the field lines are perpendicular to the plates and, except near the edges,
they are parallel to each other. Therefore the electric field (see Fig. 16–47,
