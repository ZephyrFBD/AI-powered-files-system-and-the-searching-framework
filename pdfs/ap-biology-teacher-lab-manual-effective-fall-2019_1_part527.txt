■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
There are several directions in which students can go with their own investigations. 
1. Students can determine whether any satellite colonies have been transformed. 
Do not tell them this in advance, but the majority of satellite colonies form when 
transformed cells release beta-lactamase (the enzyme encoded by the plasmid that 
degrades ampicillin) into the surrounding medium. Nontransformed bacteria can 
then survive and grow. 
2. Students can vary the transformation process by altering the amount of DNA, ratio 
of transformation solutions, time for heat shock, or growth stage of bacteria. 
3. Students can investigate the effects of mutations on gene expression and whether 
mutations affect plasmids. However, you must make sure that any mutagens st
