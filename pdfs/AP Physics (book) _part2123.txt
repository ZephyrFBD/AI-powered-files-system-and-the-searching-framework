How to Connect Meters
Suppose you wish to determine the current I in the circuit shown in Fig. 19–33a,
and the voltage V across the resistor 
How exactly are ammeters and volt-
meters connected to the circuit being measured?
Because an ammeter is used to measure the current flowing in the circuit, it
must be inserted directly into the circuit, in series with the other elements, as shown
in Fig. 19–33b. The smaller its internal resistance, the less it affects the circuit.
A voltmeter is connected “externally,” in parallel with the circuit element across
which the voltage is to be measured. It measures the potential difference between
two points. Its two wire leads (connecting wires) are connected to the two points, as
shown in Fig. 19–33c, where the voltage across 
is being measured. The larger its
internal resistance (
Fig.19–32), the less it affects the circuit being measured.
