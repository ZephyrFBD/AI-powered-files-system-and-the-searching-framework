permeable to IKI and not permeable
to starch. Since no test for glucose was reported, no conclusion can be drawn for the bagâ€™s permeability to glucose.
3. C. Signaling molecules are small molecules that bind to larger receptor proteins embedded in the plasma
membrane. In general, the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor protein induces a change in the shape of
the receptor protein. Although you do not need to know this to answer this question, the receptor protein here is a
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that, when activated by the signaling molecule, causes two RTKs to form a pair
(dimer). Autophosphorylation follows, allowing the subsequent phosphorylation of relay proteins.
4. B. Activation of this receptor protein (a receptor tyrosine kinase, or RTK) induces autophosphorylation which, in
turn, phosphorylates relay proteins. The relay protein then exchanges a GTP for the GDP on a nearby G protein,
which, in this case, is the Ras protein.
5. B. In a signaling cascade, th
