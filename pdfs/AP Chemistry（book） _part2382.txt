Equilibrium Constants in Terms of Pressure, Kp
When the reactants and products in a chemical reaction are gases, we can for-
mulate the equilibrium-constant expression in terms of partial pressures. When 
partial pressures in atmospheres are used in the expression, we denote the equi-
librium constant Kp (where the subscript p stands for pressure). For the general 
reaction in Equation 15.7, we have
 
Kp =
1P
D2d1P
E2e
1P
A2a1P
B2b 
[15.11]
where P
A is the partial pressure of A in atmospheres, P
B is the partial pressure of B in atmo-
spheres, and so forth. For example, for our N2O4>NO2 reaction, we have
 
Kp =
1P
NO222
P
N2O4
 
For a given reaction, the numerical value of Kc is generally different from the numer-
ical value of Kp. We must therefore take care to indicate, via subscript c or p, which con-
stant we are using. It is possible, however, to calculate one from the other using the 
ideal-gas equation  
 (Section 10.4):
