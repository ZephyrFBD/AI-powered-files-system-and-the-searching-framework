11. The pAMP-pKAN plasmid contains both the ampicillin resistance gene and a kanamycin resistance gene.
(a) Describe a method for inserting this plasmid into a bacterial cell.
(b) Explain how one could detect which bacterial cells had successfully absorbed the pAMP-pKAN plasmid.
(c) A restriction enzyme makes a cut in the kanamycin resistance gene. Predict the result if a bacterium
absorbs this piece of DNA that has been cut by the restriction enzyme.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. The comet assay technique is one way of measuring the relative amount of DNA damage in a cell. The nucleus
of a cell is placed on a slide coated with an agarose gel. An electric current is applied to the gel, and smaller
pieces of DNA will move farther away from the locatio
