n the previous two Chapters we have been studying static electricity: electric
charges at rest. In this Chapter we begin our study of charges in motion, and
we call a flow of charge an electric current.
In everyday life we are familiar with electric currents in wires and other
conductors. Most practical electrical devices depend on electric current: current
through a lightbulb, current in the heating element of a stove, hair dryer, or elec-
tric heater, as well as currents in electronic devices. Electric currents can exist in
conductors such as wires, but also in semiconductor devices, human cells and
their membranes (Section 18–10), and in empty space.
In electrostatic situations, we saw in Section 16–9 that the electric field must
be zero inside a conductor (if it weren’t, the charges would move). But when
charges are moving along a conductor, an electric field is needed to set charges
into motion, and to keep them in motion aga
