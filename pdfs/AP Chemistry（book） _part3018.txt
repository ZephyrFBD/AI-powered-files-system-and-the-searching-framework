The second law of thermodynamics tells us the essential character of any sponta-
neous change—it is always accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the universe. 
We can use this law as a criterion to predict whether or not a given process is sponta-
neous. Before seeing how this is done, however, we will find it useful to explore entropy 
from a molecular perspective.
A word on notation before we proceed: Throughout most of the remainder of this chap-
ter, we will focus on systems rather than surroundings. To simplify the notation, we will usu-
ally refer to the entropy change of the system as ∆S rather than explicitly indicating ∆Ssys.

The Molecular Interpretation  
of Entropy and the Third Law  
of Thermodynamics
As chemists, we are interested in molecules. What does entropy have to do with them 
and with their transformations? What molecular property does entropy reflect? Ludwig 
Boltzmann (1844–1906) gave another conceptual meaning to the notion of entropy, an
