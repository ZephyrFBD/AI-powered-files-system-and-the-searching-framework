 you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that
chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? If you
had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?

During transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template, reading nucleotides in a 3′ to 5′
direction, with U pairing with A and C with G, and assembling the mRNA transcript in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In prokaryotes,
mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template. Transcription continues until RNA polymerase
reaches a stop or terminator sequence at the end of the gene. Termination frees the mRNA and o
