ary productivity. Some of the organic compounds made by a producer are needed by the organism to power its
own life processes. The amount of organic compounds left after the producer meets its own energy needs is called
its net primary productivity.
Primary consumers eat photosynthetic organisms and get energy through the breakdown of the organic
compounds by the process of cellular respiration. Other consumers in the ecosystem eat these primary consumers.
Eventually, organisms die, and decomposers break down the organic compounds found in the dead organisms so
that the nutrients they contain may be returned to the ecosystem. These energy transfers in ecosystems are called
energy dynamics.
In this lab, Fast Plant (Brassica rapa) seeds are grown in a sealed ecosystem. As the Fast Plants grow, eggs from
the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) are introduced and allowed to hatch. The resulting larvae consume the
leaves of the Fast Plants (which are a member of the cabbage family). The
