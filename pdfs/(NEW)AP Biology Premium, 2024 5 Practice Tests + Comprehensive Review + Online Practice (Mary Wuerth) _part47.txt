n of plants. The
height of each plant in this second generation is measured, and again the mean plant height and standard error of the
mean are calculated. The data are shown in the following table:
 
Mean Plant Height on Day 28 (mm)
Generation 1
158.4
8.8
Generation 2
203.1
9.6
Construct a graph of the mean plant height for each generation, showing 95% confidence intervals. First, find the
upper and lower limits for the 95% confidence intervals for each generation.
For Generation 1:
Upper limit of 95% CI = 158.4 + 2(8.8) = 176.0 mm
Lower limit of 95% CI = 158.4 – 2(8.8) = 140.8 mm
For Generation 2:
Upper limit of 95% CI = 203.1 + 2(9.6) = 222.3 mm
Lower limit of 95% CI = 203.1 – 2(9.6) = 183.9 mm
Graphing the means for each generation with the 95% confidence intervals leads to Figure 2.1.

Now that you know how to construct graphs with 95% confidence intervals, it is important to understand what
they can tell us when compar
