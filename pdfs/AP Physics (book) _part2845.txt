ated (parallel) beam of
X-rays passes through the body to a detector that measures the transmitted 
intensity. Measurements are made at a large number of points as the source and
detector are moved past the body together. The apparatus is then rotated slightly
about the body axis and again scanned; this is repeated at (perhaps) 1° intervals
for 180°. The intensity of the transmitted beam for the many points of each scan,
and for each angle, is sent to a computer that reconstructs the image of the slice.
Note that the imaged slice is perpendicular to the long axis of the body. For this
reason, CT is sometimes called computerized axial tomography (CAT), although
the abbreviation CAT, as in CAT scan, can also be read as computer-assisted
tomography.
tomos = slice, graph = picture.

Normal X-ray image is
a sort of shadow
(no lenses are involved)
The use of a single detector as in Fig. 25–42 would require a few minutes for
the many scans needed to form a complete image. M
