 0.016 g, would you
expect the six-legged insect to remain on top of the water?
Why or why not?
*71. (III) Estimate the diameter of a steel needle that can just
barely remain on top of water due to surface tension.
*10–14 Pumps; the Heart
*72. (II) A physician judges the health of a heart by measuring the
pressure with which it pumps blood. If the physician mis-
takenly attaches the pressurized cuff around a standing
patient’s calf (about 1 m below the heart) instead of the arm
(Fig. 10–42), what error (in Pa) would be introduced in the
heart’s blood pressure measurement?

73. A 3.2-N force is applied to the plunger of a hypodermic
needle. If the diameter of the plunger is 1.3 cm and that of
the needle is 0.20 mm, (a) with what force does the fluid
leave the needle? (b) What force on the plunger would be
needed to push fluid into a vein where the gauge pressure
is 75 m
