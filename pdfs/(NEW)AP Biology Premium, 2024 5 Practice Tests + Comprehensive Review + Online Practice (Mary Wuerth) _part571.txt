ecrease in
largemouth bass, the number of dace fish increased since there were no longer as many predators
(largemouth bass) to contend with.
(d) The algae density in the lake would increase. This is because algae are consumed by daphnia and daphnia
are consumed by dace fish. If the numbers of dace fish increase (following the introduction of the great blue
herons), more daphnia will be consumed and there will be fewer daphnia to consume the algae. Thus, the
algae density in the lake will increase.

Overview
The AP Biology course is designed to help you develop skills in six core science practices:
1. Explaining biological concepts
2. Analyzing visual representations
3. Asking questions and designing experiments to test those questions
4. Representing and accurately describing data
5. Using statistical tests to analyze data
6. Using evidence to develop
