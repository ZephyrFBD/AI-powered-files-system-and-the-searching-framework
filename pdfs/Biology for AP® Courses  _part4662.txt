 atoms together. These chemical bonds thereby store this energy for later use in the process of respiration. Most
terrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the
dissolved form (carbonic acid, H2CO3âˆ’). However carbon dioxide is acquired, a by-product of the process is oxygen. The
photosynthetic organisms are responsible for depositing approximately 21 percent oxygen content of the atmosphere that
we observe today.
Heterotrophs and autotrophs are partners in biological carbon exchange (especially the primary consumers, largely
herbivores). Heterotrophs acquire the high-energy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming them, and breaking
them down by respiration to obtain cellular energy, such as ATP. The most efficient type of respiration, aerobic respiration,
requires oxygen obtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Thus, there is a constant exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide between the auto
