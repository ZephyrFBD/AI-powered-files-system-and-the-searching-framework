r or sacrifices its reproduction to help another
individual (of the same species) rear its young. However, altruistic behavior actually increases inclusive fitness, the
fitness of the individual plus the fitness of relatives (who, in fact, share a percentage of identical genes with the
altruist). Evolution of these behaviors occurs by kin selection, a form of natural selection that increases inclusive
fitness.
Beldingâ€™s ground squirrels give alarm calls (whistles) that warn other squirrels that a predator is approaching. In
doing so, the squirrel risks safety by revealing its presence (an altruistic behavior) but increases the survival of other
squirrels with which it lives. As it turns out, these squirrels live in groups of closely related females (daughters,
mothers, sisters, and aunts). Thus, it is an example of kin selection.
Bees live in colonies (hives) that consist of a queen and female daughters (worker bees). Since only the queen
reproduces, the fitness of worker bees is zero,
