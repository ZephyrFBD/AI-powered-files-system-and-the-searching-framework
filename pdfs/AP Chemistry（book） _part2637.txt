molecules 
have been omitted for clarity. (a) Which is the stronger acid, 
HX or HY? (b) Which is the stronger base, X- or Y -? (c) If you 
mix equal concentrations of HX and NaY, will the equilibrium
HX1aq2 + Y -1aq2 ∆ HY1aq2 + X-1aq2
lie mostly to the right 1Kc 7 12 or to the left 1Kc 6 12?

 16.4  The probe of the pH meter shown here is sitting in a bea-
ker that contains a clear liquid. (a) You are told the liquid is 
pure water, a solution of HCl(aq), or a solution of KOH(aq). 
Which one is it? (b) If the liquid is one of the solutions, 
what is its molarity? (c) Why is the temperature given on 
the pH meter? [Sections 16.4 and 16.5]
