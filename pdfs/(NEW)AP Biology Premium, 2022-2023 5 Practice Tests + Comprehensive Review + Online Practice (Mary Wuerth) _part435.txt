.
■Over time, favorable phenotypes will become more prevalent in a population as members of the population
without those favorable phenotypes do not survive.
This is how Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection would explain the evolution of long necks in
giraffes (see Figure 19.1):
■Variations in populations resulted in some giraffes having longer necks and others having shorter necks.
■Giraffes with longer necks can reach more food and therefore are more likely to survive and reproduce
(differential reproductive success).
■Over time, only giraffes with longer necks will be present in a population because giraffes with shorter necks
will not survive.

Examples of Evolution by Natural Selection
There are many examples of evolution by natural selection. One example is antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In a bacteria
population, some bacteria will have genotypes that cause them to be sensitive to an antibiotic; others have genotypes
that conf
