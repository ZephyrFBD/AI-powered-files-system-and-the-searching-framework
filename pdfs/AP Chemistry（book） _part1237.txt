groups 5A, 6A, and 7A to contain 3-, 2-, and 1- anions, respectively.

Lattice energies cannot be determined directly by experiment. They 
can, however, be calculated by envisioning the formation of an ionic 
compound as occurring in a series of well-defined steps. We can then 
use Hess’s law 
 (Section 5.6) to combine the steps in a way that 
gives the lattice energy for the compound. By so doing, we construct 
a Born–Haber cycle, a thermochemical cycle named after
