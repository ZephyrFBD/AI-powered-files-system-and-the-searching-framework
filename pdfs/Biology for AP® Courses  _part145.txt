sed to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the
mass number. Since an elementâ€™s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic
mass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number
contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes,
some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20
neutrons).
