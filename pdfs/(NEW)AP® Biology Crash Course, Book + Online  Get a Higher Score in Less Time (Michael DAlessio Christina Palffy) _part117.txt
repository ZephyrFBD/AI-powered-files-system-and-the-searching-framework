ng one chromosome and others have two copies of that chromosome.
A normal gamete and a gamete missing one chromosome (n − 1) join to create a zygote with
a missing chromosome that is called a monosomic.
A normal gamete and a gamete with an extra chromosome (n + 1) may join to create a zygote
with an extra chromosome that is called a trisomic.
C. Consequences of Mutations—the effects of mutations run the gamut from neutral to lethal, but mutations
also provide the raw material for evolution by natural selection.
1. Mutations can occur in somatic cells or germ cells.
i.
If a mutation occurs in a germ cell, it can be inherited because the products of germ cells are
gametes.
ii. If a mutation occurs in somatic cells, it is not inherited through sexual reproduction, but it may
have other effects in the organism in which it occurs, such as the development of cancer.
2. Germ cell mutations that do not affect the fitness of an organism are known as neutral mutations.
i.
Neutral mutations resul
