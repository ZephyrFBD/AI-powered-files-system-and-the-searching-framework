r ligand, binds to one of these receptors, the ligand is
brought into the cell by the invagination, or “folding in” of the cell membrane. A vesicle then forms around the
incoming ligand and carries it into the cell’s interior.
Bulk Flow
Other substances move by bulk flow. Bulk flow is the one-way movement of fluids brought about by pressure. For
instance, the movement of blood through a blood vessel and the movement of fluids in xylem and phloem of plants
are examples of bulk flow.
Dialysis
Dialysis is the diffusion of solutes across a selectively permeable membrane. Special membranes that have holes of
a certain size within them can be used to sort substances by using the process of diffusion. Kidney dialysis is a
specialized process by which the blood is filtered by using machines and concentration gradients. Things present at
high levels will naturally diffuse out of the blood; dialysis just gives them the opportunity.
Exocytosis
Sometimes large particles are transported out of the
