4. Density-dependent inhibition—process in which cells stop dividing when they are in contact with each
other.
5. Anchorage dependence—cells must be attached to something to divide properly.
C. When Regulation of the Cell Cycle Does Not Work
1. Cancer cell—cells that are said to be “transformed” from normal cells to cancer cells and do not
exhibit density-dependent inhibition. Have uncontrolled growth pattern.
2. Tumor—a pocket of abnormal cells among normal cells.
3. Benign tumor—nonspreading of abnormal cells.
4. Malignant tumor—abnormal cells that invade and impact the normal function of an organ.
5. Metastasis—spreading of malignant tumor to other parts of the body.

Cell Communication
I.
Key Concepts
A. Cell-to-cell communication is essential for multicellular organisms and their overall development, growth,
and homeostasis.
B. Cell-to-cell communication between cells is also important for unicellular organisms.
C. Universal mechanisms of cell communication suggest a
