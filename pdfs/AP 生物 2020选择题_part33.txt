34. Scientists were interested in testing the effects of rotenone, a broad-spectrum pesticide, on a cell culture. Cell 
culture A was used as a control, while culture B was treated with rotenone. After a period of time, the scientists 
measured the concentration of several metabolites in the mitochondria of cells in both cultures. Their results are 
shown in the table below.
