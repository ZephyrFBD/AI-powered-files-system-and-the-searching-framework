CHAPTER 21 Nuclear Chemistry
Beta Radiation Beta radiation consists of streams of beta (B) particles, which are 
high-speed electrons emitted by an unstable nucleus. Beta particles are represented in 
nuclear equations by 0
-1e or more commonly by b-. The superscript 0 indicates that the 
mass of the electron is exceedingly small relative to the mass of a nucleon. The sub-
script -1 represents the negative charge of the beta particle, which is opposite that of 
the proton.
Iodine-131 is an isotope that undergoes decay by beta emission:

We see from this equation that beta decay causes the atomic number of the reactant to 
increase from 53 to 54, which means a
