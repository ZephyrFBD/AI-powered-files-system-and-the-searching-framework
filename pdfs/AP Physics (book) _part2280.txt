I) A single square loop of wire 22.0 cm on a side is placed
with its face parallel to the magnetic field as in Fig. 20–34b.
When 5.70 A flows in the coil, the torque on it is 
What is the magnetic field strength?
52. (I) If the current to a motor drops by 12%, by what factor
does the output torque change?
0.325 mN.
47. (II) A 550-turn horizontal solenoid is 15 cm long. The current
in its coils is 38 A. A straight wire cuts through the center
of the solenoid, along a 3.0-cm diameter. This wire carries
a 22-A current downward (and is connected by other wires
that don’t concern us). What is the force on this wire
assuming the solenoid’s magnetic field points due east?
48. (III) You have 1.0 kg of copper and want to make a prac-
tical solenoid that produces the greatest possible magnetic
field for a given voltage. Should you make your copper wire
long and thin, short and fat, or something else? Consider
other variables, such as solenoid diameter, length, and so
on. Explain your reasoning.
