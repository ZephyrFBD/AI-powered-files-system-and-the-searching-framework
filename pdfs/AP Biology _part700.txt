The Neuron
The neuron consists of a cell body, which contains the nucleus and other
organelles, and two types of cytoplasmic extensions called dendrites and
axons. Dendrites are sensory; they receive incoming messages from other
cells and carry the electrical signal to the cell body. A neuron can have
hundreds of dendrites. A neuron has only one axon, which can be several
feet long in large mammals. Axons transmit an impulse from the cell body
outward to another cell. Many axons are wrapped in a fatty myelin sheath
that is formed by Schwann cells. Figure 16.4 shows a sketch of a neuron.

Figure 16.4 The Neuron
There are three types of neurons:
Sensory neurons receive an initial stimulus from a sense organ, such
as the eyes and ears, or from another neuron.
A motor neuron stimulates effectors (muscles or glands). A motor
neuron, for example, can stimulate a digestive gland to release a
digestive enzyme or to stimulate a mus
