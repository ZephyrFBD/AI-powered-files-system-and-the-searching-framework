9. A car travels along the x axis with increasing speed. We
don’t know if to the left or the right. Which of the graphs
in Fig. 2–34 most closely represents the motion of the
car?
(20 ms) = (v + v0)2.
v2 = (20 ms)2 - 2g(y - y0).
y = y0 + (–20 ms)t - (12)gt2.
v = (20 ms) - gt.
g = 9.8 ms2
±
20 ms.

[The Problems at the end of each Chapter are ranked I, II, or III
according to estimated difficulty, with level I Problems being easiest.
Level III are meant as challenges for the best students. The Prob-
lems are arranged by Section, meaning that the reader should 
have read up to and including that Section, but not only that
Section—Problems often depend on earlier material. Next is 
a set of “General Problems” not arranged by Section and not
ranked. Finally, there are “Search and Learn” Problems that require
rereading parts of the
