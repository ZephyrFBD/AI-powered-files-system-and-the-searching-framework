sic scientists to help determine the DNA of individuals.
2. The DNA of humans is highly homologous. There are sequences called Short Tandem Repeats
(STRs). These repeats vary in length and size for each human, and therefore, can be used as
identifying factors of humans.
3. STRs can be visualized using DNA gel electrophoresis.
Fully understanding the cloning process is considered a major concept in the APÂ® Biology course. You should understand how
restriction enzymes and vectors are used in tandem to construct a recombinant plasmid.

Applications of Genetic Engineering
A. Genetic engineering techniques have created transgenic plants that are now used in agriculture to increase
crop yields, reduce pesticide and fertilizer use, improve nutritional quality of grains, and create plants
tolerant to extreme weather conditions such as drought.
B. Practical uses of DNA technology in medicine include production of vaccines and other pharmaceutical
products.
