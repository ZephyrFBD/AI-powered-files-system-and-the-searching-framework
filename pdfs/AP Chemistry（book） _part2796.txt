d in general chemistry laboratory programs to illustrate equilibria, to teach the 
properties of common metal ions in solution, and to develop laboratory skills. Typ-
ically, such analyses proceed in three stages: (1) The ions are separated into broad 
groups on the basis of solubility properties. (2) The ions in each group are separated 
by selectively dissolving members in the group. (3) The ions are identified by means 
of specific tests.
A scheme in general use divides the common cations into five groups (Figure 17.23). 
The order in which reagents are added is important in this scheme. The most selective 
separations—those that involve the smallest number of ions—are carried out first. The 
Give It Some Thought
An aqueous solution contains a soluble compound of either silver, barium, or copper. 
If a precipitate forms when HCl is added to the solution, which ion must be present?
