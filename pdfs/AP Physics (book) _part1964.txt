18–3 Ohm’s Law: Resistance and Resistors
To produce an electric current in a circuit, a difference in potential is required.
One way of producing a potential difference along a wire is to connect its ends to
the opposite terminals of a battery. It was Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) who
established experimentally that the current in a metal wire is proportional to the
potential difference V applied to its two ends:
If, for example, we connect a wire to the two terminals of a 6-V battery, the cur-
rent in the wire will be twice what it would be if the wire were connected to a 3-V
battery. It is also found that reversing the sign of the voltage does not affect the
magnitude of the current.
