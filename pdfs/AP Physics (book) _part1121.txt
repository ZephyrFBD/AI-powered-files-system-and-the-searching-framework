*61. (II) What diameter must a 15.5-m-long air duct have if the
ventilation and heating system is to replenish the air in a
room 
every 15.0 min? Assume the
pump can exert a gauge pressure of 
*62. (II) What must be the pressure difference between the two
ends of a 1.6-km section of pipe, 29 cm in diameter, if it is
to transport oil 
at a rate
of
*63. (II) Poiseuille’s equation does not hold if the flow velocity
is high enough that turbulence sets in. The onset of turbu-
lence occurs when the Reynolds number, Re, exceeds
approximately 2000. Re is defined as
where is the average speed of the fluid,
is its density,
is
its viscosity, and r is the radius of the tube in which the fluid
is flowing. (a) Determine if blood flow through the aorta is
laminar or turbulent when the average speed of blood in the
aorta
during the resting part of the heart’s cycle
is about 
(b) During exercise, the blood-flow speed
approximately doubles. Calculate the Reynolds number in
this case,
