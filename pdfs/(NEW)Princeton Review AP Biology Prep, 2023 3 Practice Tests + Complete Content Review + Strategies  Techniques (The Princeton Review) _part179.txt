he cell is life’s basic unit of structure and
function. This simply means that the cell is the smallest unit of living material that can carry out all the activities
necessary for life.
It may seem strange that we are still made of tiny little cells. Why not just be a living thing that is one giant cell?
One reason for this is because compartments allow more specialization. As we will see, compartmentalization is an
important part of the organization of unicellular and multicellular organisms.
The second reason we can’t just be giant cells is the surface area-to-volume ratio. There is always lots of exchange
going on between the inside of things and the outside. This ratio must be kept large so that there is plenty of space to
do these exchanges. Some parts of living things are special because they have many folds, which increase the
surface area. Generally, smaller cells have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio; this allows them to more efficiently
exchange materials with their surr
