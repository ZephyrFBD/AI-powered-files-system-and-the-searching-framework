ve to hurry and look in other pubs before 
 
  
  
 Dad drinks the whole five pounds.We can’t find him in other pubs 
 
 either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are 
 
 so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking 
 
 for a month.We have to tell Mam there’s no sign of him and she tells us 
 
 we’re pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I’d search 
 
 every pub in Limerick. I’d tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. 
 
 Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station 
 
 and try Naughton’s fish and chip shop. 
 
 I have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can’t stray 
 
 far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. 
 
 I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men’s lavatories. 
 
 I’m hungry but I’m afraid to go home till I find my father. He’s 
 
 not in Naughton’s fish and chip shop but there’s a drunken man asleep 
 
 at a table in the corner
