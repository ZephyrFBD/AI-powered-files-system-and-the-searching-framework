CHAPTER 22 Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Nitric oxide (NO) is also a colorless gas but, unlike N2O, it is slightly toxic. It can be 
prepared in the laboratory by reduction of dilute nitric acid, using copper or iron as a 
reducing agent:
 
3 Cu1s2 + 2 NO3
-1aq2 + 8 H+1aq2 ¡ 3 Cu2 +1aq2 + 2 NO1g2 + 4 H2O1l2 [22.36]
Nitric oxide is also produced by direct reaction of N2 and O2 at high temperatures. This 
reaction is a significant source of nitrogen oxide air pollutants. 
 (Section 18.2) The 
direct combination of N2 and O2 is not used for commercial production of NO, however, 
because the yield is low, the equilibrium constant Kp at 2400 K being only 0.05. 
 (Sec-
tion 15.7, “Chemistry Put to Work: Controlling Nitric Oxide Emissions”)
The commercial route to NO (and hence to other oxygen-containing compounds of 
nitrogen) is via the catalytic oxidation of NH3:
 
4 NH31g2 + 5 O21g2 ¡
