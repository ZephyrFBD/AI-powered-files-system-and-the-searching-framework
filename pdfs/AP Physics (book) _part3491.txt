0 mrem (1 mSv) per year in addition to natural back-
ground. It is believed that even low doses of radiation increase the chances of
cancer or genetic defects; there is no safe level or threshold of radiation exposure.
The upper limit for people who work around radiation—in hospitals, in
power plants, in research—has been set higher, a maximum of 20 mSv (2 rem)
whole-body dose, averaged over some years (a maximum of 
in
any one year). To monitor exposure, those people who work around radiation
generally carry some type of dosimeter, one common type being a radiation film
badge which is a piece of film wrapped in light-tight material. The passage of
ionizing radiation through the film changes it so that the film is darkened upon
development, and thus indicates the received dose. Newer types include the
thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). Dosimeters and badges do not protect the
worker, but high levels detected suggest reassignment or modified work practices
to reduce radiation exposure t
