 by the symbol H, is defined as the internal energy plus 
the product of the pressure, P, and volume, V
, of the system:
 
H = E + PV 
[5.5]
Like internal energy E, both P and V are state functions—they depend only on the current 
state of the system and not on the path taken to that state. Because energy, pressure, and 
volume are all state functions, enthalpy is also a state function.
Pressure–Volume Work
To better understand the significance of enthalpy, recall from Equation 5.4 that ∆E in-
volves not only the heat q added to or removed from the system but also the work w done 
*You are probably familiar with the notion of atmospheric pressure from a previous course in 
chemistry. We will discuss it in detail in Chapter 10. Here we need realize only that the atmo-
sphere exerts a pressure on the surface of Earth that is nearly constant.
