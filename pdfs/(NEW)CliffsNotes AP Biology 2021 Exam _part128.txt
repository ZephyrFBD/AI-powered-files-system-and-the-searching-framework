ts.
Along the way, 3 NADH
 
and 1 FADH2, and 1 ATP are made, and 2 CO2 are released. FADH2,
 
like NADH, is a coenzyme, accepting electrons during a reaction.
 
The CO2 produced by the Krebs cycle is the CO2 animals exhale when they breathe.

Oxidative Phosphorylation
Oxidative phosphorylation is the process of producing ATP from NADH
 
and FADH2. Electrons from NADH and FADH2pass along an electron
transport chain (ETC) . The chain consists of proteins that pass these electrons from one carrier protein to the next.
Some carrier proteins, such as the cytochromes, include nonprotein parts containing iron. Along each step of the
chain, the electrons give up energy used to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. NADH provides electrons that have enough
energy to generate about 3
ATP, while FADH2 generates about 2 ATP.
 
The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is oxygen. The Â½
 
O2 accepts the two electrons and, together with 2 H+, forms water.
