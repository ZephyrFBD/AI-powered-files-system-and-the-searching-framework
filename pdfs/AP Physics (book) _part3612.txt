numbers c, b, ) that
distinguish these new quarks from the 3 original quarks (see Table 32–3). These
properties (like strangeness) are conserved in strong, but not weak, interactions.
Figure 32–15 shows one of the events that provided evidence for the top quark.
All quarks have spin and an electric charge of either 
or 
(that is,
a fraction of the previously thought smallest charge e). Antiquarks have opposite
sign of electric charge Q, baryon number B, strangeness S, charm c, bottom b,
and top . Other properties of quarks are shown in Table 32–3.
