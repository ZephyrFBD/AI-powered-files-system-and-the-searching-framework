environmental fluctuations.
Natural selection requires genetic variation and an environmental pressure that gives some
individuals an advantage.
To see how this process unfolds in nature, let’s return to the moth case. Why did the dark moths in the north
survive? Because they were dark-colored. But how did they become dark-colored? The answer is, through random
mutation. One day, long before the coal burning, a moth was born with dark-colored wings. As long as a mutation
does not kill an organism before it reproduces (most mutations, in fact, do), it may be passed on to the next
generation. Over time, this one moth had offspring. These, too, were dark. The dark- and the light-colored moths
lived happily side by side until something from the outside—in our example, the environment—changed all that.
The initial variation came about by chance. This variation gave the dark moths an edge. However, that advantage did
not become apparent until something made it apparent. In our case, that som
