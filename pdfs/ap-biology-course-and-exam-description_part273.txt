ledge and establish lines of evidence, using them 
to develop and refine testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. The science practices that follow 
capture important aspects of the work that scientists engage in, at the level of competence expected of AP Biology 
students. These practices are effectively integrated with the course content and can be paired with a variety of 
learning objectives. You are strongly encouraged to design instruction with these science practices in mind.
Science Practice 1: Explain biological concepts, processes, and 
models presented in written format.
The ability to use verbal and/or written explanations 
relates to the overall function of the biological system. 
Students should have a deep enough understanding of 
the processes to predict the effects of environmental 
changes on those processes and justify their prediction 
(see Practice 6). Additionally, they should be able to use 
their understanding to explain the results of their o
