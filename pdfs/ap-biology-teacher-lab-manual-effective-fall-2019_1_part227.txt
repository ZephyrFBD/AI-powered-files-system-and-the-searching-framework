of the real world. For that reason, you 
need to constantly evaluate the assumptions you make as you build a model, as well as 
evaluate the results of the model with a critical eye. This is actually one of the powerful 
benefits of a model â€” it forces you to think deeply about an idea. 
There are many approaches to model building; in their book on mathematical  
modeling in biology, Otto and Day (2007) suggest the following steps:  
1. Formulate the question. 
2. Determine the basic ingredients. 
3. Qualitatively describe the biological system. 
4. Quantitatively describe the biological system. 
5. Analyze the equations. 
6. Perform checks and balances.

 Relate the results back to the question. 
As you work through the next section, record your thoughts, assumptions, and strategies 
on modeling in your laboratory notebook. 
Step 1 Formulate the question. 
Think about a recessive Mendelian trait such as cystic fibrosis. Why do recessive alleles 
like cystic fibrosis stay in the hu
