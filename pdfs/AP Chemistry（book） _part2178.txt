ollision 
to lead to a reaction, however, it must occur with sufficient energy to break bonds and 
with suitable orientation for new bonds to form in the proper locations. We will consider 
these factors as we proceed through this chapter.
Go Figure
If a heated steel nail were placed in 
pure O2, would you expect it to burn 
as readily as the steel wool does?
Steel wool heated in air 
(about 20% O2) glows red-hot 
but oxidizes to Fe2O3 slowly.
Red-hot steel wool in 100% O2 
burns vigorously, forming 
Fe2O3 quickly.
▲ Figure 14.1 Effect of concentration on 
reaction rate. The difference in behavior is 
due to the different concentrations of O2 
in the two environments.
Give It Some Thought
In a reaction involving reactants in the gas state, how does increasing the partial 
pressures of the gases affect the reaction rate?

The speed of an event is defined as the change that occurs in a given time interval, which 
means that w
