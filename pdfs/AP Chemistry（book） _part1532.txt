s are organic dyes that are used for many applica-
tions, such as the coloring of fabrics. Many azo dyes are 
derivatives of the organic substance azobenzene, C12H10N2.  
A closely related substance is hydrazobenzene, C12H12N2. 
The Lewis structures of these two substances are

(Recall the shorthand notation used for benzene.) 
 
(a) What is the hybridization at the N atom in each of the 
substances? (b) How many unhybridized atomic orbitals 
are there on the N and the C atoms in each of the sub-
stances? (c) Predict the N ¬ N ¬C angles in each of the 
substances. (d) Azobenzene is said to have greater delo-
calization of its p electrons than hydrazobenzene. Discuss 
this statement in light of your answers to (a) and (b). (e) All 
the atoms of azobenzene lie in one plane, whereas those 
of hydrazobenzene do not. Is this observation consistent 
with the statement in part (d)? (f) Azobenzene is an intense 
red-orange color, whereas hydrazobenzene
