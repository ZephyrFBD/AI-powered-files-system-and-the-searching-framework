o the pure solvent, depends 
on the molality of the solute. But it is important to remember that boiling-point eleva-
tion is proportional to the total concentration of solute particles, regardless of whether 
the particles are molecules or ions. When NaCl dissolves in water, 2 mol of solute parti-
cles (1 mol of Na+ and 1 mol of Cl-) are formed for each mole of NaCl that dissolves. We 
take this into account by defining i, the van’t Hoff factor, as the number of fragments 
that a solute breaks up into for a particular solvent. The change in boiling point for a 
solution compared to the pure solvent is:
 
∆T
b = T
b(solution) -  T
b(solvent) = iKbm 
[13.12]
In this equation, T
b1solution2 is the boiling point of the solution, T
b1solvent2 is the 
boiling point of the pure solvent, m is the molality of the solute, Kb is the molal boiling- 
point-elevation constant for the solvent (which is a proportionality constant that is 
experimentally determined for each solvent), and i is the van’
