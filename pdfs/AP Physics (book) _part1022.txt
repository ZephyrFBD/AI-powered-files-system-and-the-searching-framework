n have any size or mass, but the density will be the same for each.
We can use the concept of density, Eq. 10–1, to write the mass of an object as
and the weight of an object as
The SI unit for density is 
Sometimes densities are given in 
Note that a density given in 
must be multiplied by 1000 to give the result
in
For 
example, the density of aluminum is
which equals 
The densities of various substances are given in Table 10–1. The Table specifies
temperature and atmospheric pressure because they affect density (the effect is
slight for liquids and solids). Note that air is about 1000 times less dense than water.

APPROACH First we use the standard formula
(see inside rear cover)
to obtain the sphere’s volume. Then Eq. 10–1 and Table 10–1 give us
