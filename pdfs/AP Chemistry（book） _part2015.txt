at are 
held together by weak intermolecular forces.
 
 The solid wedges in the figure indicate bonds from carbon 
that come out of the plane of the page; the dashed wedges 
indicate bonds that lie behind the plane of the page.
(a) What is the hybridization of orbitals at each carbon 
atom? What angles do you expect between the bonds?
(b) Now imagine that the polymer is polypropylene 
rather than polyethylene. Draw structures for poly-
propylene in which (i) the CH3 groups all lie on the 
same side of the plane of the paper (this form is called 
isotactic polypropylene), (ii) the CH3 groups lie on al-
ternating sides of the plane (syndiotactic polypropyl-
ene), or (iii) the CH3 groups are randomly distributed 
on either side (atactic polypropylene). Which of these 
forms would you expect to have the highest crystallin-
ity and melting point, and which the lowest? Explain 
in terms of intermolecular interactions and molecular 
shapes.
(c) Polypropylene fibers have been employed in athle
