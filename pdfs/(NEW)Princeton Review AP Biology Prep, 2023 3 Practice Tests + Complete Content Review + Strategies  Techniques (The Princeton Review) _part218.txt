ses the energy stored in the chemical bonds.
Reactions that require an input of energy are called endergonic reactions. You’ll notice that the products have more
energy than the reactants. An example is plants’ use of carbon dioxide and water to form sugars.
Activation Energy
Even though exergonic reactions release energy, the reaction might not occur naturally without a little bit of energy
to get things going. This is because the reactants must first turn into a high energy molecule, called the transition
state, before turning into the products. The transition state is sort of a reactants-products hybrid state that is difficult
to achieve. In order to reach this transition state, a certain amount of energy is required. This is called the activation
energy.
Be careful: a transition state is not the same thing as a reaction intermediate.
Transition states occur in each step of every reaction, between the reactant(s)
and the product(s). Intermediates are formed between each step of a mu
