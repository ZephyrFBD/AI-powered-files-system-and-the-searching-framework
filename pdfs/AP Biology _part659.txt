wastes. Everything that passes into the collecting tubule is excreted from
the body. From the collecting tubule or duct, urine passes through the
ureter to the urinary bladder. Urine is temporarily stored in the urinary
bladder until it passes out of the body via the urethra. See Figure 15.7.

Hormone Control of the Kidneys
If blood pressure falls, the ability of the nephron to filter blood at
Bowmanâ€™s capsule is impaired, placing the body in danger. Therefore, the
kidney must respond quickly by increasing blood pressure. It can do this
because the kidney is under the control of three hormones: aldosterone,
antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and renin.

IMPORTANT TIP
Hormone function is an important example of how cells use chemical signals to communicate.
Aldosterone is a hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to
a decrease in blood pressure or volume. It acts on the distal tubules of the
nephron to reab
