 (Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics.) A population is identified, in
part, by where it lives, and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries: natural boundaries might be
rivers, mountains, or deserts, while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass, manmade structures, or roads.
The study of population ecology focuses on the number of individuals in an area and how and why population size changes
over time. Population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the Karner blue butterfly, for example, because
it is classified as federally endangered. However, the distribution and density of this species is highly influenced by the
distribution and abundance of wild lupine. Researchers might ask questions about the factors leading to the decline of
wild lupine and how these affect Karner blue butterflies. For example, ecologists know that wild lupine thrives in open
areas where trees and shrubs are largely
