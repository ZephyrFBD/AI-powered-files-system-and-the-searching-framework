tion, we ﬁrst 
calculate the amount of each reactant and each 
product present at the completion of the reac-
tion. Because you can assume this neutralization 
reaction proceeds as far toward the product side 
as possible, this is a limiting reactant problem.
Thus, the reaction produces a solution contain-
ing a mixture of NH3, NH4
+, and Cl-. The NH3 is 
a weak base 1Kb = 1.8 * 10-52, NH4
+ is its con-
jugate acid, and Cl- is neither acidic nor basic. 
Consequently, the pH depends on 3NH34 and 
3NH4
+4:
 3NH34 =
0.0258 mol NH3
0.500 L soln
= 0.0516 M
 3NH4
+4 = 0.0492 mol NH4
+
0.500 L soln
= 0.0984 M
Chapter Summary and Key Terms
THE COMMON ION EFFECT (SECTION 17.1) In this chapter, we 
have considered several types of important equilibria that occur in 
aqueous solution. Our primary emphasis has been on acid–base equi-
libria in solutions containing two or more solutes and on solubility 
equilibria. The dissociation of a weak acid or weak base is repressed 
by the presence of a stro
