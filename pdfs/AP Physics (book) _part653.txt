MisConceptual Questions 10 and 11.
1. You push very hard on a heavy desk, trying to move it. You

(a) whether or not it moves, as long as you are exerting a

(b) only if it starts moving.
(c) only if it doesn’t move.

(a) No work is done if there is no contact between objects.
(b) No work is done because there is no gravity in space.
(c) No work is done if the direction of motion is
