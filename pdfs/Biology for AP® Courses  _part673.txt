requires energy. Therefore, the chemical
reactions involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. On the other hand, the catabolic process of breaking
sugar down into simpler molecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the example of rust above, the
breakdown of sugar involves spontaneous reactions, but these reactions donâ€™t occur instantaneously. Figure 6.8 shows some
other examples of endergonic and exergonic reactions. Later sections will provide more information about what else is
required to make even spontaneous reactions happen more efficiently.

Figure 6.8 Shown are some examples of endergonic processes (ones that require energy) and exergonic
processes (ones that release energy). These include (a) a compost pile decomposing, (b) a chick developing from
a fertilized egg, (c) sand art being destroyed, and (d) a ball rolling down a hill. (cred
