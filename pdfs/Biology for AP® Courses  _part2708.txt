Ethylene
Ethylene is associated with fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall. Ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas
(C2H4). Hundreds of years ago, when gas street lamps were installed in city streets, trees that grew close to lamp posts
developed twisted, thickened trunks and shed their leaves earlier than expected. These effects were caused by ethylene
volatilizing from the lamps.
Aging tissues (especially senescing leaves) and nodes of stems produce ethylene. The best-known effect of the hormone,
however, is the promotion of fruit ripening. Ethylene stimulates the conversion of starch and acids to sugars. Some people
store unripe fruit, such as avocadoes, in a sealed paper bag to accelerate ripening; the gas released by the first fruit to
mature will speed up the maturation of the remaining fruit. Ethylene also triggers leaf and fruit abscission, flower fading
and dropping, and promotes germination in some cereals and sprouting of bul
