 current and voltage that is specified or measured. For example, in the
United States and Canada, standard line voltage is 120-V ac. The 120 V is 
the peak voltage 
is (Eq. 18–8b)
In much of the world (Europe, Australia, Asia) the rms voltage is 240 V, so the
peak voltage is 340 V. The line voltage can vary, depending on the total load; the
frequency of 60 Hz or 50 Hz, however, remains extremely steady.

Hair dryer. (a) Calculate the resistance and the peak cur-
rent in a 1500-W hair dryer (Fig. 18–23) connected to a 120-V ac line. (b) What
happens if it is connected to a 240-V ac line in Britain?
