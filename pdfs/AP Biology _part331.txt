nemia results from a single
point mutation in a single base pair in the gene that codes for hemoglobin.
This point mutation is responsible for the production of abnormal
hemoglobin that can cause red blood cells to sickle when oxygen tension is
low. When red blood cells sickle, a variety of tissues may be deprived of
oxygen and suffer severe, permanent damage. The possibility exists,
however, that a point mutation could result in a beneficial change for an
organism or, because of wobble in the genetic code, result in no change in
the proteins produced. (Wobble is the relaxation of the base pairing rules
for the third base in a codon.) Here is an example of wobble:

No change occurs in the amino acid.
The mutation shown above is called a silent mutation because it does not
result in any change in the amino acid sequence.
