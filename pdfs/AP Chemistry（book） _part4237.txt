three of the elements with an even number of protons have fewer 
than three isotopes: He, Be, and C. Note that these three elements 
are the lightest elements that have an even atomic number. Because 
they are so light, any change in the number of neutrons will change 
the neutron/proton ratio significantly. This helps to explain why 
they do not have more stable isotopes. None of the elements in

Figure 24.1 Tetrahedral Figure 24.2 The OH group is polar 
whereas the CH3 group is nonpolar. Hence, adding CH3 will (a) 
reduce the substance’s solubility in polar solvents and (b) increase  
its solubility in nonpolar solvents. Figure 24.5 CnH2n,
