 the
solute potential becomes.
Try the following sample calculation for water potential.
A solution of 0.50 molar glucose is at a temperature of 21°C and open to the atmosphere. What is its water
potential?
Because the solution is open to the atmosphere, its pressure potential is zero. So its total water potential is its
solute potential.
Glucose is a covalent compound, so i = 1. Convert 21°C to Kelvin:
Using the formula for solute potential:
Here is an example in which the pressure potential is not 0 bars:
A plant cell has a pressure potential of 1.0 bars and a solute potential of –6.50 bars. What is its water potential?
Osmolarity and Its Regulation
Osmolarity is the total concentration of solutes in a solution. Living organisms need to closely regulate their
internal solute concentration and their water potential. If an organism became too dehydrated, it might die. If too
much water moved into a cell, the pressure potential from the water moving into the cell could cause the cell to
