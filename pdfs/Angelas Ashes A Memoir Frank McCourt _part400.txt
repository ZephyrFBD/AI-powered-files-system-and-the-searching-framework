 and his fish and chips are on the floor in their 
 
 Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don’t get them the cat will so I shove 
 
 them under my jersey and I’m out the door and up the street to sit on 
 
 the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken 
 
 soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my 
 
 mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them 
 
 in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I’m in a state of sin for 
 
 stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it’s 
 
 Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my 
 
 soul after my feed. 
 
  
  
 The Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street. 
 
 Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it’s a fortnight since my last confession. 
 
 I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a 
 
 drunken man. 
 
 Why,my child? 
 
 I was hungry, Father. 
 
 And why were you hungry?
