mixture of the two solutions will still have 3H+4 6 3OH-4.  
Figure 16.6 Lemon juice. It has a pH of about 2 whereas black cof-
fee has a pH of about 5. The lower the pH, the more acidic the solu-
tion. Figure 16.8 Phenolphthalein changes from colorless, for pH 
values less than 8, to pink for pH values greater than 10. A pink color 
indicates pH 7 10. Figure 16.9 Bromthymol blue would be most 
suitable because it changes pH over a range that brackets pH = 7. 
Methyl red is not sensitive to pH changes when pH 7 6, while phe-

Figure 21.3 that have an odd number of protons have more than 
two stable isotopes. Figure 21.6 6.25 g. After one half-life, the 
amount of the radioactive material will have dropped to 25.0 g. After 
two half-lives, it will have dropped to 12.5 g. After three half-lives, 
it will have dropped to 6.25 g. Figure 21.7 Plants convert 14CO2
