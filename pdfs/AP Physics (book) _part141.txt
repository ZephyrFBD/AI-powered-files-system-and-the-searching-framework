 other cases, they may differ: recall the walk we
described earlier, in Fig. 2–4, where a person walked 70 m east and then 30 m west.
The total distance traveled was 
but the displacement was
40 m. Suppose this walk took 70 s to complete. Then the average speed was:
The magnitude of the average velocity, on the other hand, was:
To discuss one-dimensional motion of an object in general, suppose that at
some moment in time, call it 
the object is on the x axis at position 
in a
coordinate system, and at some later time,
suppose it is at position 
The
elapsed time (
in time) is
during this time interval the
displacement of our object is
Then the average velocity,
defined as the displacement divided by the elapsed time, can be written
[average velocity]
(2;2)
where 
stands for velocity and the bar 
over the 
is a standard symbol
meaning “average.”
For one-dimensional motion in the usual case of the 
axis to the right,
note that if 
is less than 
the object is moving to the left, and then
