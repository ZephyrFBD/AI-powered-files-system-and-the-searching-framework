tracellular receptor, activating it. The receptor may be in the cytoplasm
or in the nucleus. In some cases, activation of the receptor triggers the release of an inhibitor that prevented the
receptor from functioning.
3. The receptor-signaling molecule complex acts as a transcription factor. The receptor-signal complex binds to
the DNA, promoting (or suppressing) the transcription of genes.
4. Deactivation of the pathway can occur when signaling molecules or receptor proteins are enzymatically
degraded. In some cases, phosphorylation of the receptor protein results in deactivation. In addition, the release of
hormones into the blood is typically shut down by negative feedback mechanisms.

Steroid hormones, such as testosterone or estrogen, are examples of ligands that bind to intracellular receptors.
These signaling molecules diffuse across the plasma membrane and bind to a specific receptor protein in the
cytoplasm. The now activated complex (hormone + receptor protein) move
