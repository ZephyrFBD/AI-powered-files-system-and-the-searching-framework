d water caused the bursting
of red blood cells because the solution was hypotonic to the
red blood cells.

The dilution of albumin in distilled water caused the
shriveling of the red blood cells because the solution was
hypertonic to the red blood cells.

3. The energy required for protein segments to span a plasma
membrane was calculated and presented in the graphs shown.
The higher the free energy required, the less likely the amino acid
will be found in that environment. The grayed rectangle shows the
region associated with the membrane lipids. Graphs A and B
below represent results obtained for diﬀerent types of amino
acids, but are not labeled.

Which of the following best characterizes how the graphs should
be labeled?
Graph A represents nonpolar amino acids and Graph B
represents charged amino acids.
