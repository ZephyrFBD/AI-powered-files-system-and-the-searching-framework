Belding’s ground squirrels give alarm calls that warn others that a predator is approaching. The evolutionary value
for the individual caller, who assumes risk by calling attention to itself, is discussed later in the chapter under
“Social Behavior.”

physical stresses of the environment as well as from predators.
Birds incubate their eggs and feed the hatchlings. Since females have invested the most in producing the offspring,
