hose of
animals on the mainland of South America. One possible explanation for these similarities is
a common ancestor. As we’ll see below, there are other explanations for similar traits.
However, when organisms share multiple traits, it’s pretty safe to say that they likely also
shared a common ancestor.
Embryology, or the study of development of an organism: if you look at the early stages in
vertebrate development, all embryos look alike! For example, all vertebrates—including fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and even mammals such as humans—show fishlike features
called gill slits.
Comparative anatomy, or the study of the anatomy of various animals: scientists have
discovered that some animals have similar structures that serve different functions. For
example, a human’s arm, a dog’s leg, a bird’s wing, and a whale’s fin are all the same
appendages, though they have evolved to serve different purposes. These structures, called
homologous structures, also point to a common ancesto
