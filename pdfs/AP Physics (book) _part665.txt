ed of a car is increased by 50%, by what factor
will its minimum braking distance be increased, assuming
all else is the same? Ignore the driver’s reaction time.
23. (II) At an accident scene on a level road, investigators
measure a car’s skid mark to be 78 m long. It was a rainy
day and the coefficient of friction was estimated to be 0.30.
Use these data to determine the speed of the car when the
driver slammed on (and locked) the brakes. (Why does the
car’s mass not matter?)
24. (III) One car has twice the mass of a second car, but only
half as much kinetic energy. When both cars increase their
speed by 
they then have the same kinetic energy.
What were the original speeds of the two cars?
25. (III) A 265-kg load is lifted 18.0 m vertically with an accel-
eration  
by a single cable. Determine (a) the
tension in the cable; (b) the net work done on the load;
(c) the work done by the cable on the load; (d) the work
done by gravity on the load; (e) the final speed of the load
