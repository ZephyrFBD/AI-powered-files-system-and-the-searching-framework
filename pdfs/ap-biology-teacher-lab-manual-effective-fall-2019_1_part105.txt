■ Modeling 
How does one teach modeling? In this lab manual, one of the exercises walks the 
students through the steps necessary to begin developing a spreadsheet-based Hardy-
Weinberg population genetics model. Throughout this process, students will be making 
claims and evaluating evidence in support of them, engaging in both reasoning and 
rebuttal. It is important, though, that you work through these models beforehand to 
get a feel for the process. To give you an idea of how you might approach modeling 
instruction, the following is an example of the steps you could take to develop a model of 
predator-prey cycles with students — as a game and as a mathematical model. 
■ Modeling from Words to Equations to Graphs 
The interaction of a predator and a prey population is a fairly straightforward biological 
system to model because we can begin with a simple accounting of the birth a
