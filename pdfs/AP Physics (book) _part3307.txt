The energy level of impurity atoms lies
slightly below the conduction band in an n-type semiconduc-
tor, and acts as a donor from which electrons readily pass into
the conduction band. The energy level of impurity atoms in a
p-type semiconductor lies slightly above the valence band and
acts as an acceptor level, since electrons from the valence band
easily reach it, leaving holes behind to act as charge carriers.
A semiconductor diode consists of a pn junction and allows
current to flow in one direction only; pn junction diodes are
used as rectifiers to change ac to dc, as photovoltaic cells to
produce electricity from sunlight, and as lasers. Light-emitting
diodes (LED) use compound semiconductors which can emit
light when a forward-bias voltage is applied; uses include read-
outs, infrared remote controls, visible lighting (flashlights,
street lights), and very large TV screens. LEDs using organic
molecules or polymers (OLED) are used as screens on cell
phones and other displays. Com
