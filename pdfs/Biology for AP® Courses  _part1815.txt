y cell, but not necessarily all at the same time.
Proteins are expressed only when they are needed. Eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded in
any given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression. To express a
protein, the DNA is first transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, these processes
occur almost simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation
that occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene expression in prokaryotes is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas in
eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-
translational levels.
16.2 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control
the transcription of an oper
