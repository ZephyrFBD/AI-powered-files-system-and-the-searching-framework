scientist who has been dubbed ‘The Father of Modern Vaccines’.
Enders is claimed to have ‘discovered’ the process of the viral
culture which ‘proved’ that a ‘virus’ caused measles. Cowan
explains how Enders did this ‘by using the EXACT same procedure
that has been followed by every virologist to ﬁnd and characterize
every new virus since 1954’. Enders took throat swabs from children
with measles and immersed them in 2ml of milk. Penicillin (100u/ml)
and the antibiotic streptomycin (50,g/ml) were added and the whole
mix was centrifuged – rotated at high speed to separate large cellular
debris from small particles and molecules as with milk and cream,
for example. Cowan says that if the aim is to ﬁnd liĴle particles of
genetic material (‘viruses’) in the snot from children with measles it
would seem that the last thing you would do is mix the snot with
other material – milk –that also has genetic material. ‘How are you
ever going to know whether whatever you found came from the snot
