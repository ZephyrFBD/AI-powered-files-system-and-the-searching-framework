information provided, which of the following 
predictions about the direct, local effects of 
climate change is most likely? 
(A) Ocean warming will favor population 
growth of nonnative species as their 
habitats shift northward. 
(B) Ocean warming will decrease eelgrass 
habitat area as a result of increased 
herbivory by nonnative species. 
(C) Harmful algal blooms will decrease otter 
populations as a result of increased 
mortality of otter prey species. 
(D) Harmful algal blooms will decrease the 
availability of nutrients for eelgrass and 
other algae species.
