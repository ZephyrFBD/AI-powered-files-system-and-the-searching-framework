 
been used to effect this change in potential energy? (b) If the 
caterpillar is the system, can you predict the sign of q as the 
caterpillar climbs? (c) Does the caterpillar do work in climb-
ing the twig? Explain. (d) Does the amount of work done in 
climbing a 12-inch section of the twig depend on the speed 
of the caterpillar’s climb? (e) Does the change in potential en-
ergy depend on the caterpillar’s speed of climb? [Section 5.1]
