Food webs trace energy flow in a community. Diﬀerent trophic
levels consist of primary producers (plants), primary

consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores),
and decomposers (bacteria).
Materials such as water, nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus
travel through the environment and are recycled in
biogeochemical cycles involving diﬀerent life forms.

Human activity has aﬀected the environment significantly (e.g.,
ozone depletion, habitat destruction, and global warming).

1. Oligotrophic lakes are nutrient poor and have very clear water.
However, large quantities of fertilizer runoﬀ can cause more
biological growth in these lakes. Continuing input of fertilizer can
transform oligotrophic lakes into eutrophic lakes that are rich in
organic material. How does the addition of fertilizer ingredients,
such as ammonia, lead to changes in the lakes?
Ammonia in fertilizer can be broken down to release energy
