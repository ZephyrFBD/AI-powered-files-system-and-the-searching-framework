(b) What are the possible values of ms for the orbital?
 6.60  A hydrogen atom orbital has n = 5 and ml = -2. (a) What 
are the possible values of l for this orbital? (b) What are the 
possible values of ms for the orbital?
 6.61  Which of the following represent impossible combinations 
of n and l? (a) 1p, (b) 4s, (c) 5f, (d) 2d
 6.62  For the table that follows, write which orbital goes with the 
quantum numbers. Don’t worry about x, y, z subscripts. If the 
quantum numbers are not allowed, write “not allowed.”
