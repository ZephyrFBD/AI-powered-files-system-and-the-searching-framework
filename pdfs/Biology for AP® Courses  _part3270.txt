 on their frequency (wavelength = hue) and amplitude (intensity = brightness).
In the vertebrate retina, there are two types of light receptors (photoreceptors): cones and rods. Cones, which are the
source of color vision, exist in three forms—L, M, and S—and they are differentially sensitive to different wavelengths.
Cones are located in the retina, along with the dim-light, achromatic receptors (rods). Cones are found in the fovea, the
central region of the retina, whereas rods are found in the peripheral regions of the retina.
Visual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal ganglion cells, which make up the optic nerves. Ganglion cells
come in several versions. Some ganglion cell axons carry information on form, movement, depth, and brightness, while
other axons carry information on color and fine detail. Visual information is sent to the superior colliculi in the midbrain,
where coordination of eye movements and integration of auditory information takes place. Visual i
