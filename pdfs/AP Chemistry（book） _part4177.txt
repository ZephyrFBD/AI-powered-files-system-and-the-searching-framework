89 Gold, Au should have more electrons 
in antibonding orbitals. Tungsten, W, lies near the middle of the 
transition metal series where the bands arising from the d orbitals 
and the s orbital are approximately half-filled. This electron count 
should fill the bonding orbitals and leave the antibonding orbit-
als mostly empty. Because both elements have similar numbers of 
electrons in the bonding orbitals but tungsten has fewer electrons in 
antibonding orbitals, it will have a higher melting point. pageÂ 490 
No. In a crystal the lattice points must be identical. Therefore, if 
an atom lies on top of a lattice point, then the same type of atom 
points. Os in OsO4 has an oxidation number of +8 and Cr in Cr2O3 
has an oxidation number of +3. In Section 8.4, we learn that a com-
pound with a metal in a high oxidation state should show a high 
degree of covalence and OsO4 fits this situation. page 318 There 
is probably a better choice of Lewis structure than the one chosen. 
Because the
