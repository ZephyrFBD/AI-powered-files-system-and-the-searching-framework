e mammalian blastula to two layers—the inner cell mass and the
trophoblast—results in the formation of the blastocyst.

Human Development site to step through an interactive that shows the stages of embryo development, including
micrographs and rotating 3-D images.
Which early embryonic stage is characterized by a fluid-filled cavity with an inner cell mass surrounded by a layer of
cells?
a.
blastocyst
b.
blastula
c.
blastocoel
d.
gastrula
Gastrulation
The typical blastula is a ball of cells. The next stage in embryonic development is the formation of the body plan. The
cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells. This process is called gastrulation. During
gastrulation, the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells. Each of these layers is called a germ layer and
each germ layer differentiates into different organ systems.
