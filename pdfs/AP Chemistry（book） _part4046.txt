ndense from 
the gas phase to the solid-state, so we expect a signiﬁcant decrease 
in the molar volume. (c) The molar volumes are 0.0351 L  >  mol Cl2 
and 0.0203 L  >  mol NH3 (d) Solid-state molar volumes are not as simi-
lar as those in the gaseous state, because most of the empty space is 
gone and molecular characteristics determine properties. Cl2(s) is 
heavier, has a longer bond distance and weaker intermolecular forces, 
so it has a signiﬁcantly larger molar volume than NH3(s). (e) There is 
little empty space between molecules in the liquid state, so we expect 
their molar volumes to be closer to those in the solid state than those 
in the gaseous state. 11.15 (a) London dispersion forces (b) dipole–
