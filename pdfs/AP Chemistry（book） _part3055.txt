e use ∆H and ∆S to predict whether a given reaction occurring at con-
stant temperature and pressure will be spontaneous? The means for doing so was first 
developed by the American mathematician J. Willard Gibbs (1839–1903). Gibbs pro-
posed a new state function, now called the Gibbs free energy (or just free energy), G, 
and defined as
 
G = H - TS 
[19.10]
where T is the absolute temperature. For an isothermal process, the change in the free 
energy of the system, ∆G, is
 
∆G = ∆H - T∆S 
[19.11]
Give It Some Thought
If a process is exothermic, does the entropy of the surroundings (a) always 
increase, (b) always decrease, or (c) sometimes increase and sometimes decrease, 
depending on the process?

CHAPTER 19 Chemical Thermodynamics
Under standard conditions, this equation becomes
 
∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S° 
[19.12]
To see how the state function G relates to reaction spontaneity, recall that for a reac-
tion occurring at constant temperature and pr
