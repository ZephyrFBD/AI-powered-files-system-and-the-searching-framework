in NaOH.
The definitions of molarity and molality are similar enough that they can be easily 
confused.
t
Molarity depends on the volume of solution.
t Molality depends on the mass of solvent.
When water is the solvent, the molality and molarity of dilute solutions are numeri-
cally about the same because 1 kg of solvent is nearly the same as 1 kg of solution, and 
 
1 kg of the solution has a volume of about 1 L.
SOLUTION
(a) Analyze We are given the number of grams of solute (13.5 g) 
and the number of grams of solvent 10.100 kg = 100 g2. From 
this, we must calculate the mass percentage of solute.
Plan We can calculate the mass percentage by using Equation 13.5. 
The mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of solute (glucose) 
and the mass of solvent (water).
Solve Mass % of glucose =
mass glucose
mass soln
* 100
 
 
    =
13.5 g
113.5 + 1002 g * 100 = 11.9%
Comment The mass percentage of water in this solution is 
1100 - 11.92% = 88.1%.
(b) Analyze In this case we are given t
