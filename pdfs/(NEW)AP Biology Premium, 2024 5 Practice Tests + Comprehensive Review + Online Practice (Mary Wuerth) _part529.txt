ty of the sections of rain forests without top predators was greatly
reduced (with fewer saplings, trees, and other plants). Without crocodiles, plant-eating animal populations grew at a
high rate, reducing the number of plants in these areas. This resulted in less habitats for the organisms that depend
on these trees and plants and a reduced number of species in these areas. On the rain forest islands with top
predators, crocodiles would eat some of the animals that feed on seeds and plants, limiting the population of these
animals and preserving the number of plant species in these areas.
The availability of food and the energy it provides organisms affects these organismsâ€™ reproductive strategies.
Different organisms use different reproductive strategies in response to energy availability. Organisms that live in
unstable environments (that have less access to energy-containing compounds) will produce large numbers of
offspring at a time. Because there is less access to energy-contai
