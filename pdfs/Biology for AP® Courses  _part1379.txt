een parents that differed by one trait produced F1
offspring that all expressed the traits of one parent. Observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits
are described as recessive. When the offspring in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F2 offspring exhibited the
dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from
the original P0 parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F1 and F2 offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes,
Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were
inherited as independent events.
Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses.
To find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the
probabilities of the individual events. The use of the word “and
