n groups a, c, b, and d are more highly adapted to
their environment than organisms in group x.
(C)
A trait that evolved in the common ancestor for clades a and
d is expected to be present in all of their descendants.
(D)
Phylogenetic Trees
Biologists maintain that all living organisms are descended from a single
common ancestor, that all the great diversity of species existing today
share a common lineage that can be traced back to the origin of life. Not
only are all eukaryotic organisms descended from a single ancestor, but
that first eukaryote is also a descendant of the first prokaryotes. Because
of this fact, the emergence of biological diversity can be likened to the
growth of a tree, in which the multitude of the tree’s branches are
ultimately derived from its trunk. This structural analogy explains why
biologists sometimes use diagrams known as phylogenetic trees to model
biodiversity.
