genetic material of the cell.
d.
Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis
found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The
cell wall is a protective layer, typically found in
prokaryotic cells and in some eukaryotes.
Chromosomal DNA, the genetic material of the
cell is present in a nucleus in prokaryotes while
it is enclosed in a nucleoid region in eukaryotes.
60. A nonpathogenic bacterium acquires resistance to
antibiotics. Which of the following scenarios describing
how this strain could pose a health risk to people is false?
a.
Genes for antibiotic resistance are transferred
from the nonpathogenic bacterium to a
pathogenic bacterium via transduction.
b.
Genes for antibiotic resistance are transferred
from the nonpathogenic bacterium to a
pathogenic bacterium via transformation.
c.
Genes for antibiotic resistance are transferred
from the nonpathogenic bacterium to a
pathogenic bacterium via conjugation.
d.
Genes for antibiotic resistance are transferred
from the nonpathogenic bacte
