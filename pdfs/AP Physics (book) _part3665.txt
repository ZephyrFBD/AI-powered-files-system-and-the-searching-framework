as about 
0.4 billion years old. We see these
galaxies as they appeared then,
13.4 billion years ago, which is when
they emitted this light. The most
distant galaxies were young and small
and grew to become large galaxies by
colliding and merging with other
small galaxies.
We examine the latest theories on
how stars and galaxies form and
evolve, including the role of
nucleosynthesis, as well as Einstein’s
general theory of relativity which
deals with gravity and curvature of
space. We take a thorough look at
the evidence for the expansion of the
universe, and the Standard Model of
the universe evolving from an initial
Big Bang. We point out some
unsolved problems, including the
nature of dark matter and dark energy
that make up most of our universe.

Use of the techniques and ideas of physics to study the night sky is often
referred to as astrophysics. Central to our present theoretical understanding of
the universe (or cosmos) is Einstein’s general theory of re
