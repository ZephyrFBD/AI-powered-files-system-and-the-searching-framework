 
 morning’s work, five shillings altogether. 
 
 Mam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks 
 
 at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I’m puzzled because money is supposed 
 
 to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass 
 
 and look at your eyes. 
 
 My face is black and the eyes are worse than ever.The whites and 
 
 the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out 
 
 over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be 
 
 picked off or washed away. 
 
 Mam says that’s the end of it.No more Mr.Hannon. I try to explain 
 
 that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do 
 
 everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the 
 
 bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is 
 
 the best, Rommel or Montgomery. 
 
 She says she’s sorry for Mr.Hannon’s troubles but we have troubles 
 
 of our own and the last thing she needs now is
