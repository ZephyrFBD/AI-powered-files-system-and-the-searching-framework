(see Section 16–10). The average kinetic energy of molecules in a living cell at 
normal temperatures 
is around 
(kinetic theory,
Chapter 13), about the magnitude of weak bonds. This means that a weak bond
can readily be broken just by a molecular collision. Hence weak bonds are not
very permanent—they are, instead, brief attachments. This helps them play par-
ticular roles in the cell. On the other hand, strong bonds—those that hold
molecules together—are almost never broken simply by molecular collision
because their binding energies are much higher (
). Thus they are
relatively permanent. They can be broken by chemical action (the making of
even stronger bonds), and this usually happens in the cell with the aid of an
enzyme, which is a protein molecule.
