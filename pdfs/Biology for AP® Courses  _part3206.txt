 two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred
that the two points are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor. If two points are felt as two separate points,
each is in the receptive field of two separate sensory receptors. The points could then be moved closer and re-tested until
the subject reports feeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from
that distance.
Thermoreception
In addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold
receptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus,
that are activated by different temperatures. Their pathways into the brain run from the spinal cord through the thalamus
to the primary somatosensory cortex. Warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves
to the brain. You know from experience that a tole
