ed depends on 
two factors that vary in opposite directions with increasing altitude. First, the forma-
tion of O3* (Equation 18.3) depends on the presence of O atoms. At low altitudes, most 
of the radiation energetic enough to dissociate O2 molecules into O atoms has been 
absorbed; thus, O atoms are not very plentiful at low altitudes. Second, Equations 18.3 
and 18.4 both depend on molecular collisions. 
 (Section 14.5) The concentration 
of molecules is greater at low altitudes, and so the rates of both reactions are greater 
at lower altitudes. Because these two effects vary with altitude in opposite directions, 
the highest rate of O3 formation occurs in a band at an altitude of about 50 km, near 
the stratopause (Figure 18.1). Overall, roughly 90% of Earthâ€™s ozone is found in the 
stratosphere.
The photodissociation of ozone reverses the reaction that forms it. We thus have a 
cycle of ozone formation and decomposition, summarized on the next page:
