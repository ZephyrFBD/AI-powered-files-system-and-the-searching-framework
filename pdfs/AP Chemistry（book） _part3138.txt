spontaneous. A classmate calculates the entropy change 
for this reaction and obtains a large negative value for ∆S°. 
Did your classmate make a mistake in the calculation? 
Explain.
 [19.90]  Consider a system that consists of two standard playing 
dice, with the state of the system defined by the sum of the 
values shown on the top faces. (a) The two arrangements of 
 19.91  Ammonium nitrate dissolves spontaneously and endother-
mally in water at room temperature. What can you deduce 
about the sign of ∆S for this solution process?
 [19.92]  A standard air conditioner involves a refrigerant that is typ-
ically now a fluorinated hydrocarbon, such as CH2F2. An 
air-conditioner refrigerant has the property that it readily 
vaporizes at atmospheric pressure and is easily compressed 
to its liquid phase under increased pressure. The opera-
tion of an air conditioner can be thought of as a closed 
system made up of the refrigerant going through the two 
stages shown here (the air circulat
