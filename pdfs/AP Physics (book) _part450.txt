oefficient of kinetic friction
between the skier’s skis and the water surface is
(Fig. 4–74). (a) What is the skier’s acceleration if the rope
pulling the skier behind the boat applies a horizontal ten-
sion force of magnitude
to the skier
(b) What is the skier’s horizontal acceleration if the rope
pulling the skier exerts a force of
on the 
skier at an upward angle
(c) Explain why the
skier’s acceleration in part (b) is greater than that in 
part (a).

92. A 75-kg snowboarder has an initial velocity of 
at the top of a 28° incline (Fig. 4–75). After sliding down
the 110-m-long incline (on which the coefficient of kinetic
friction is
), the snowboarder has attained a
velocity v. The snowboarder then slides along a flat surface
(on which
) and comes to rest after a distance x.
Use Newton’s second law to find the snowboarder’s accel-
eration while on the incline and while on the flat surface.
Then use these accelerations to determine x.
