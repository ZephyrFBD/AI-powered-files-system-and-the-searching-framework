CHAPTER SUMMARY
22.1 Prokaryotic Diversity
Prokaryotes existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. Hot springs and hydrothermal vents may
have been the environments in which life began. Microbial mats are thought to represent the earliest forms of life on Earth,
and there is fossil evidence of their presence about 3.5 billion years ago. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of
prokaryotes that grows at interfaces between different types of material, mostly on moist surfaces. During the first 2 billion
years, the atmosphere was anoxic and only anaerobic or
