stimate the acceleration due to gravity at the surface
of Europa (one of the moons of Jupiter) given that its 
mass is
and making the assumption that 
its mass per unit volume is the same as Earth’s.
35. (II) Given that the acceleration of gravity at the surface of
Mars is 0.38 of what it is on Earth, and that Mars’ radius is
3400 km, determine the mass of Mars.
36. (II) Find the net force on the Moon  
due to the gravitational attraction of both the Earth
and the Sun
assuming they are at right angles to each other, Fig. 5–43.
(mS = 1.99 * 1030 kg),
(mE = 5.98 * 1024 kg)
(mM = 7.35 * 1022 kg)
4.9 * 1022 kg
7.35 * 1022 kg.
1.74 * 106 m
43. (II) Determine the distance from the Earth’s center to a
point outside the Earth where the gravitational acceleration
due to the Earth is 
of its value at the Earth’s surface.
44. (II) A certain neutron star has five times the mass of our
Sun packed into a sphere about 10 km in radius. Estimate
the surface gravity on this monster.
