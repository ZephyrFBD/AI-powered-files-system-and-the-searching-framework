Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea
3 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objective listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective m
