into the mitochondria for oxidative
phosphorylation. The transport of NADH across the mitochondrial membrane reduces the net yield of each NADH
to only 2 ATP (Table 4-1). However, the total yield from 1 glucose molecule actually hovers around 30 ATP due to
variations in mitochondria efficiencies and competing biochemical processes.

A balance sheet accounting for ATP production from glucose by aerobic respiration. Total ATP production is
theoretically 36 ATP for each glucose processed.
Anaerobic Respiration
What if oxygen is not present? If oxygen is not present, no electron acceptor exists to accept the electrons at the end
of the electron transport
 
chain. If this occurs, then NADH accumulates. After all the NAD+ has been
 
converted to NADH, the Krebs cycle and glycolysis both stop (both need
 
NAD+to accept electrons). When this happens, no new ATP is produced,
 
and the cell may soon die.
Anaerobic respiration is a method cells use to escape this fate. Although the two c
