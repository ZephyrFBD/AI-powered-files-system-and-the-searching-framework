Watch an animated tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lac_operon) about the workings of lac operon here.
The E. coli bacteria can have several mutations that affect the lac operon system. One mutation inhibits the ability of
RNA polymerase to bind to the lac operon. How would this affect the cell?
a.
The cell would make more lactose.
b.
There would be no lactose outside of the cell.
c.
The cell would not be able to process tryptophan.
d.
The cell would not be able to process lactose.
Activity
Modeling the Operon. Use construction paper or more elaborate materials, such as Styrofoam noodles,
electrical tape, and Velcro tabs, to create a model of the lac and trp operons that include a regulator,
promoter, operator, and structural genes. Then use the model to show how the presence of substrate, e.g.,
allolactose or tryptophan, can change the
