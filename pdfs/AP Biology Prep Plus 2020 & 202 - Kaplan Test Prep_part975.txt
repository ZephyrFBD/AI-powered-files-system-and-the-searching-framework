A booster dose increases immunity against an antigen back to protective levels.
“remember” the antigen. The booster dose increases the immunity against
the antigen by stimulating antibody production back to protective levels.
2. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 2
(a) Construct an appropriately labeled graph to analyze the eﬀect of
temperature over time on oxygen consumption of germinating corn
seeds. (3 points)
Graph components (1 point each, 3 points maximum)
Here is a sample graph that would earn full credit:
Axes correctly labeled and scaled
Data separated into two temperature curves with oxygen consumption as the
dependent variable
Curves correctly labeled and points plotted accurately
(b) Based on the data, explain the diﬀerences in oxygen consumption
between non-germinating and germinating corn seeds. Describe the
most likely eﬀect of temperature on the rate of cellular respiration.
Predict the likely oxygen consumption for germinating corn a
