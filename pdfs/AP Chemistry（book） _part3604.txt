NITROGEN AND THE OTHER GROUP 5A ELEMENTS (SECTIONS 22.7 
 
AND 22.8) Nitrogen is found in the atmosphere as N2 molecules. 
Molecular nitrogen is chemically very stable because of the strong 
N â€šN bond. Molecular nitrogen can be converted into ammonia via 
the Haber process. Once the ammonia is made, it can be converted 
into a variety of different compounds that exhibit nitrogen oxida-
tion states ranging from -3 to +5. The most important industrial 
conversion of ammonia is the Ostwald process, in which ammonia is 
oxidized to nitric acid 1HNO32.
Nitrogen has three important oxides: nitrous oxide 1N2O2, ni-
tric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide 1NO22. Nitrous acid 1HNO22 is 
a weak acid; its conjugate base is the nitrite ion 1NO2
-2. Another im-
portant nitrogen compound is hydrazine 1N2H42.
Phosphorus is the most important of the remaining group 5A 
elements. It occurs in nature as phosphate minerals. Phosphorus has 
several allotropes, including white phosphorus,
