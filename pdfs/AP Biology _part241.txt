and NADPH. Oxygen is a waste product of the light reactions.
Water is split, and electrons (e–) are transferred along with protons
(H+) from water to CO2, reducing the CO2 to sugar.
The light-independent reactions only occur when there is light.
Although they do not use light directly, these reactions use the
products of the light-dependent reactions: ATP and protons carried
by NADPH from the light-dependent reactions. These substances
reduce CO2 to PGAL or G3P (3-carbon sugar). Carbon fixation,
which is a reduction of CO2, occurs during the Calvin cycle.
Plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and give off water vapor
and O2 all through the same openings—stomates in leaves. This
presents a problem. Plants must keep their stomates open long
enough to take in enough CO2 to make sugar but not so long that
they lose too much water vapor and dry out. Plants have evolved
different strategies to minimize water loss. One example is C-4
photosynthesis.
