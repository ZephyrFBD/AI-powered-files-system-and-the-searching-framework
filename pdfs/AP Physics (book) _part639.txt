investigation changes its height
during the problem, then choose a reference frame
with a convenient
level for gravitational
potential energy; the lowest point in the situation is
often a good choice.
If springs are involved, choose the unstretched
spring position to be x (or y) = 0.
y = 0
6â€“10 Power
Power is defined as the rate at which work is done. Average power equals the
work done divided by the time to do it. Power can also be defined as the rate at
which energy is transformed. Thus
(6;17)
The power rating of an engine refers to how much chemical or electrical energy
can be transformed into mechanical energy per unit time. In SI units, power is meas-
ured in joules per second, and this unit is given a special name, the watt (W):
We are most familiar with the watt for electrical devices, such as 
the rate at which an electric lightbulb or heater changes electric energy into light
or thermal energy. But the watt is used for other types of energy transformations
as well.
