anchorage dependence nor do they exhibit density-dependent inhibition, so choices (A) and (D) are incorrect.
Choice (C) is incorrect because noncancerous cells spend most of their time in interphase, not mitosis.
9. (D)  Mitosis is the distribution of genetic material between the daughter cells. Cytokinesis, not mitosis, is the
distribution of cytosol between the daughter cells, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because the
replication of DNA occurs during the S stage, not mitosis. Replication of cell organelles occurs during G1 and
G2, not mitosis, so choice (C) is incorrect.
10. (C)  Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm. In animal cytokinesis, a cleavage furrow is formed. In plant
cytokinesis, a cell plate is formed. DNA and cellular organelles are replicated during interphase, but the
cytoplasm is not yet divided. So choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because mitosis is the
distribution of genetic material between the daughter cells. G0 is th
