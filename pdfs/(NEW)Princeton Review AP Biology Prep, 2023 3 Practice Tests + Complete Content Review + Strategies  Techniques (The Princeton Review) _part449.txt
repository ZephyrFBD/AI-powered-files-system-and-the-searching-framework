ategists. Once they colonize an area,
they reproduce as quickly as possible. Why? They know they’ve got to multiply before competitors arrive on the
scene! The best way to ensure their survival is to produce lots of offspring. Typical examples are common weeds,
dandelions, and bacteria.
At the other end of the spectrum are the k-strategists. These organisms are best suited for survival in stable
environments. They tend to be large animals, such as elephants, with long lifespans. Unlike r-strategists, they
produce few offspring. Given their size, k-strategists usually don’t have to contend with competition from other
organisms.
ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION
Communities of organisms don’t just spring up on their own; they develop gradually over time. Ecological
succession refers to the predictable procession of plant communities over a relatively short period of time (decades
or centuries).
Centuries may not seem like a short time to us, but if you consider the enormous stretches of time over wh
