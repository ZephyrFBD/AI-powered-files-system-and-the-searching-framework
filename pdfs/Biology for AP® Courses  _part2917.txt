outh and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity.
Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells
lining the gastrovascular cavity.
The alimentary canal, shown in Figure 25.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one
end and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested
through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard
where it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the
waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.

shown in this hydra and in this jellyfish medusa. (b) An alime
