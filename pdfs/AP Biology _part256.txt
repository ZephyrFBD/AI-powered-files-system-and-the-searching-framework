would be the most efficient at turning the
indicator from yellow to blue. (SP 1)
(B) Plants use the CO2 they take in to make sugars. Therefore, as
photosynthesis continues, and sugar is manufactured, CO2 is used
up. You could also measure the amount of sugar that appears inside
a plant cell to monitor photosynthesis. However, watching an
indicator change color is much easier. (ENE-1)
(C) Bromothymol blue turns from yellow (in the presence of an acid)
to blue as a solution becomes basic. When CO2 dissolves in water, it
becomes carbonic acid, which makes the water acidic and turns
Bromothymol blue to yellow. Phenolphthalein is another pH
indicator. It turns from clear (in the presence of an acid) to strong
pink in the presence of a base. (SP 1)
(C) When electrons in PS II (P680) get excited by light, they are
captured by an electron acceptor and shunted into an electron
transport chain that produces ATP. These excited electrons end up in
PS I (P700). The process of photolysis removes ele
