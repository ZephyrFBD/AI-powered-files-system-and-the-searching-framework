olecules are the strongest. Thus, I2 has the highest melting point and boil-
ing point. At room temperature and 1 atm, I2 is a purple solid, Br2 is a red-brown liquid, 
and Cl2 and F2 are gases. 
 (Figure 7.28) Chlorine readily liquefies upon compression at 
room temperature and is normally stored and handled in liquid form under pressure in 
steel containers.

*Minerals are solid substances that occur in nature. They are usually known by their common 
names rather than by their chemical names. What we know as rock is merely an aggregate of 
different minerals.
Use the VSEPR model to predict the structure of XeF4.
Sample Exercise 22.3 
Predicting a Molecular Structure
SOLUTION
Analyze We must predict the geometrical structure given only the 
molecular formula.
Plan We must first write the Lewis structure for the molecule. We 
then count the number of electron pairs (domains) around the Xe 
atom and use that number and the number of bonds to predict 
the geo
