 In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a "folder" in which
to insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial
context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred
to as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.
Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable
traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been
repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as
insulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment
can be introduced via the multiple cloning site (MCS). The MCS is a short DNA
