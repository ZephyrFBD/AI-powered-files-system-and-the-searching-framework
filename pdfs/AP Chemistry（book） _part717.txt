mething we can either measure or calculate and because so many physical 
and chemical changes of interest to us occur at constant pressure, enthalpy is a more use-
ful function for most reactions than is internal energy. In addition, for most reactions the 
difference in ∆H and ∆E is small because P∆V is small.
When ∆H is positive (that is, when qP is positive), the system has gained heat from the 
surroundings (Table 5.1), which means the process is endothermic. When ∆H is negative, 
the system has released heat to the surroundings, which means the process is exothermic. 
To continue the bank analogy of Figure 5.7, under constant pressure, an endothermic pro-
cess deposits energy in the system in the form of heat and an exothermic process with-
draws energy in the form of heat (Figure 5.12).
