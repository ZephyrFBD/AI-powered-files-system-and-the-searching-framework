5–4 Nonuniform Circular Motion
Circular motion at constant speed occurs when the net force on an object is
exerted toward the center of the circle. If the net force is not directed toward the
center but is at an angle, as shown in Fig. 5–15a, the force has two components.
The component directed toward the center of the circle,
gives rise to the cen-
tripetal acceleration,
and keeps the object moving in a circle. The component
tangent to the circle,
acts to increase (or decrease) the speed, and thus gives
rise to a component of the acceleration tangent to the circle,
When the speed
of the object is changing, a tangential component of force is acting.
When you first start revolving a ball on the end of a string around your head,
you must give it tangential acceleration. You do this by pulling
