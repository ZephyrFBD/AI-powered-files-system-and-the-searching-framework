ied to the gravitational force (Chapter 5). Thus we
can say that a gravitational field exists for every object that has mass. One object
attracts another by means of the gravitational field. The Earth, for example,
can be said to possess a gravitational field (Fig. 16–33) which is responsible for
the gravitational force on objects. The gravitational field is defined as the 
force per unit mass. The magnitude of the Earth’s gravitational field at any point
above the Earth’s surface is thus 
where 
is the mass of the Earth,
r is the distance of the point from the Earth’s center, and G is the gravitational
constant (Chapter 5). At the Earth’s surface, r is the radius of the Earth and the
gravitational field is equal to g, the acceleration due to gravity. Beyond the Earth,
the gravitational field can be calculated at any point as a sum of terms due to Earth,
Sun, Moon, and other bodies that contribute significantly.
