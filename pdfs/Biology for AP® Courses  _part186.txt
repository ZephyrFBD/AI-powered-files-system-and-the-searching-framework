could exist at all.
The information presented and the examples highlighted in this section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined
in Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a
transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® Exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
