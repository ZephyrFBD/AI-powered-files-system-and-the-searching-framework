 these alleles. Being haploid, P.
falciparum needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.
In Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different
geographic regions. This is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant
mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other P. falciparum isolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-
resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an
over-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an
infection cycle, P. falciparum evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective
pressure of commonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop
new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.

According to this passage, why does P. falciparum only need one drug-resistant dhps allel
