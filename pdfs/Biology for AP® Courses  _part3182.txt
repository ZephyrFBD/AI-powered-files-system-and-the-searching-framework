 perceive natural electrical stimuli produced by other animals in its environment, a sense called electroreception.
This enhanced ability to sense prey gives the shark an evolutionary advantage over other fish. While it is helpful to this
underwater predator, electroreception is a sense not found in most land animals. You can read more about electroreception
in sharks at the Sharks info website (http://openstax.org/l/32sharks) .
Connection for AP® Courses
The content in this chapter is not within the scope of AP® other than to recognize the link between the sensory organs
and the nervous system. The ability to detect and respond to information is critical to an organism’s survival and
fitness. If time permits, you might explore the evolution of one type of sensory receptor (photoreceptors, chemoreceptor,
thermoreceptor, or proprioceptor) in several different animal species, with special consideration of the features that allow it
to convert a stimulus to a nerve impulse. (This task is
