hromosomes replicate during
the S phase of interphase. The cell contains the diploid chromosome
number, not the haploid number. (IST-1)
(C) Most of the life of a cell is spent in interphase. Therefore, the
largest slice of the pie chart should be interphase. It does not matter
that G1, S, and G2 are not labeled as part of interphase in choice C.
Choice B is not correct because, although it allocates a large amount

of the pie chart for interphase, it shows G1, S, and G2 as separate
slices rather than part of the interphase slice. Choices A and D
incorrectly show interphase as a small slice of the pie. (IST-1)
(A) See Figure 4.8. The M phase, which is triggered by MPF, occurs
after G2. Chiasmata are a significant feature of meiotic cell division.
If a cell begins meiosis with 12 chromosomes, after meiosis I, each
daughter cell will contain half that number, 6. Plant cells do not have
centrioles. (IST-1 & IST-3)
