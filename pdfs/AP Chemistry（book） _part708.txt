modynamic quantities, such as E, are state functions. Other 
quantities, such as q and w, are not. This means that, although ∆E = q + w 
does not depend on how the change occurs, the specific amounts of heat 
and work depend on the way in which the change occurs. Thus, if changing 
the path by which a system goes from an initial state to a final state increases 
 
the value of q, that path change will also decrease the value of w by exactly the 
same amount. The result is that ∆E is the same for the two paths.
We can illustrate this principle using a flashlight battery as our system. As 
the battery is discharged, its internal energy decreases as the energy stored in 
the battery is released to the surroundings. In Figure 5.10, we consider two pos-
sible ways of discharging the battery at constant temperature. In Figure 5.10(a), 
a wire shorts out the battery and no work is accomplished because nothing is 
moved against a force. All the energy lost from the battery is in the form of
