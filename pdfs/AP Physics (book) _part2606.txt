 magnitude of the magnification
of a concave mirror is less than 1 if the object is beyond 
the center of curvature 
and is greater than 1 
if the object is within 
23. (III) Show, using a ray diagram, that the magnification m of
a convex mirror is
just as for a concave mirror.
[Hint: Consider a ray from the top of the object that reflects
at the center of the mirror.]
24. (III) An object is placed a distance r in front of a wall,
where r exactly equals the radius of curvature of a certain
concave mirror. At what distance from the wall should this
mirror be placed so that a real image of the object is
formed on the wall? What is the magnification of the image?
23–4 Index of Refraction
25. (I) The speed of light in ice is 
What is the
index of refraction of ice?
26. (I) What is the speed of light in (a) ethyl alcohol, (b) lucite,
(c) crown glass?
27. (II) The speed of light in a certain substance is 82% of its
value in water. What is the index of refraction of that 
substance?
