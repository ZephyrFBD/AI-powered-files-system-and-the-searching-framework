Freshwater is the term used to denote natural waters that have low concentrations 
(less than 500 ppm) of dissolved salts and solids. Freshwater includes the waters of 
lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams. The United States is fortunate in its abundance of 
freshwater:1.7 * 1015 L (660 trillion gallons) is the estimated reserve, which is renewed 
by rainfall. An estimated 9 * 1011 L of freshwater is used every day in the United States. 
Most of this is used for agriculture (41%) and hydroelectric power (39%), with small 
amounts for industry (6%), household needs (6%), and drinking water (1%). An adult 
drinks about 2 L of water per day. In the United States, our daily use of water per per-
son far exceeds this subsistence level, amounting to an average of about 300 L/day for 
personal consumption and hygiene. We use about 8 L/person for cooking and drinking, 
about 120 L/person for cleaning (bathing, laundering, and housecleaning), 80 L>person 
for flushing toilets, and 80 L/person fo
