or precision”?
Give It Some Thought
A sample that has a mass of about 25 g is weighed on a balance that has a precision 
of 0.001 g. How many significant figures should be reported for this measurement?
To determine the number of significant figures in a reported measurement, read the 
number from left to right, counting the digits starting with the first digit that is not zero. 
In any measurement that is properly reported, all nonzero digits are significant. Because zeros 
can be used either as part of the measured value or merely to locate the decimal point, 
they may or may not be significant:
 t Zeros between nonzero digits are always significant—1005 kg (four significant figures); 
7.03 cm (three significant figures).
 t Zeros at the beginning of a number are never significant; they merely indicate the position 
of the decimal point—0.02 g (one significant figure); 0.0026 cm (two significant figures).
 t Zeros at the end of a number are significant if the number contains a
