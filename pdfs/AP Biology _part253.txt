photosynthesis, oxygen is released. In this experiment, aerobic
bacteria organize themselves close to an oxygen source—those cells
that carry out photosynthesis and are therefore releasing oxygen.
That leaves one question—which lights provide the highest rate of
photosynthesis? The answer is violet light and red light. Choice D
has more bacteria clustered in violet light and red light. Choices A
and B do not show that distribution and are thus incorrect. Choice C
is not correct because it shows the bacteria in a distribution that does
not make sense. (ENE-1 & SP 3)
(A) Carbon fixation produces sugars or G3P in the Calvin cycle of
light-independent reactions. Choices B, C, and D relate to light-
dependent reactions. (ENE-1)
(B) Photosystem II occurs first; PS I occurs second. PS II loses
electrons into the ETC and replaces them from water, which plants
take in. When PS I loses electrons into the ETC, it replaces them
with electrons from PS II. Choic
