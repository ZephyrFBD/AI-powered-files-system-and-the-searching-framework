, or photons as they are now called, as well as via
the waves predicted by Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. The photon theory of
light was also a radical departure from classical ideas. Einstein proposed a test of the
quantum theory of light: quantitative measurements on the photoelectric effect.

When light shines on a metal surface, electrons are found to be emitted from
the surface. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it occurs in many
materials, but is most easily observed with metals. It can be observed using the
apparatus shown in Fig. 27–6. A metal plate P and a smaller electrode C are
placed insi
