10. (I) An EM wave has a wavelength of 720 nm. What is its
frequency, and how would we classify it?
11. (I) An EM wave has frequency 
What is its
wavelength, and how would we classify it?
12. (I) A widely used “short-wave” radio broadcast band is
referred to as the 49-m band. What is the frequency of a
49-m radio signal?
13. (I) What is the frequency of a microwave whose wavelength
is 1.50 cm?
14. (II) Electromagnetic waves and sound waves can have the
same frequency. (a) What is the wavelength of a 1.00-kHz
electromagnetic wave? (b) What is the wavelength of a
1.00-kHz sound wave? (The speed of sound in air is 
)
