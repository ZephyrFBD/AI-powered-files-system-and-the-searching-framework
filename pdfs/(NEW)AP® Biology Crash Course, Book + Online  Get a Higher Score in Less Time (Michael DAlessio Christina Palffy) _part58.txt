e homeostatic temperature, the response will stop.
2. Positive feedback—occurs when a stimulus produces a result, and the result causes further
stimulation, thereby triggering an event.
i.
An example is labor and childbirth.
ii. When a baby’s head pushes on the uterine walls (the stimulus), a hormone called oxytocin is
released which causes muscles to contract which causes more pressure on the uterine wall.
iii. This occurs until the stimulus is gone after the baby exits the body.
F. Homeostatic mechanisms that are conserved or divergent across related organisms reflect either continuity
due to common ancestry or evolutionary change in response to distinct selective pressures.

Disruptions of Homeostasis
A. Biological systems are affected by disruptions in their dynamic homeostasis. These disruptions can occur
at the molecular level and affect the health of the organism, or at the level of the entire ecosystem,
affecting the survival of parts or all of the population.
B. Molecular a
