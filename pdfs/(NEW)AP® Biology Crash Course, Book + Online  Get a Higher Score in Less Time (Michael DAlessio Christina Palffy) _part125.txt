scent with Modification

scientific data and extrapolation. Several scientists began to use data to debunk natural theology as a
means for explaining scientific findings.
2. Charles Darwin built on the ideas of other scientists to develop his theory of “descent with
modification” by natural selection.
3. While examining the fossil record, both Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Darwin agreed that species evolve
over time, but each proposed a different mechanism:
i.
