red. If we don’t
overwhelm students with too much detail, especially at the start, maybe they can
find physics interesting, fun, and helpful—and those who were afraid may lose
their fear.
Chapter 1 is not a throwaway. It is fundamental to physics to realize that every
measurement has an uncertainty, and how significant figures are used. Converting
units and being able to make rapid estimates are also basic.
Mathematics can be an obstacle to students. I have aimed at including all steps
in a derivation. Important mathematical tools, such as addition of vectors and
trigonometry, are incorporated in the text where first needed, so they come with
a context rather than in a scary introductory Chapter. Appendices contain a review
of algebra and geometry (plus a few advanced topics).
Color is used pedagogically to bring out the physics. Different types of vectors
are given different colors (see the chart on page xix).
Sections marked with a star * are considered optional. These contain slight
