o identical waves, and their sum, as a function of time at three locations.
In (a) the two waves interfere constructively, in (b) destructively, and in (c) partially destructively.
†One wavelength, or one full oscillation, corresponds to 360 —see Section 11–3, just after Eq. 11–8c,
and also Fig. 11–7.

1–12 Standing Waves; Resonance
If you shake one end of a cord and the other end is kept fixed, a continuous wave
will travel down to the fixed end and be reflected back, inverted, as we saw in 
Fig. 11–33a. As you continue to oscillate the cord, waves will travel in both direc-
tions, and the wave traveling along the cord, away from your hand, will interfere
with the reflected wave coming back. Usually there will be quite a jumble. But 
if you oscillate the cord at just the right frequency, the two traveling waves will
interfere in such a way that a large-amplitude standing wave will be produced,
Fig. 11–40. It is called a “standing wave” because it does not appear to be traveling.
