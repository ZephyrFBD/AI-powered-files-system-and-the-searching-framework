amplifier known as a sounding board (piano) or sounding box (guitar, violin), which
acts to amplify the sound by putting a greater surface area in contact with the air
(Fig.12–9). When the strings are set into vibration, the sounding board or box is set
into vibration as well. Since it has much greater area in contact with the air, it can
produce a more intense sound wave. On an electric guitar, the sounding box is not
so important since the vibrations of the strings are amplified electronically.
Wind Instruments
Instruments such as woodwinds, the brasses, and the pipe organ produce sound
from the vibrations of standing waves in a column of air within a tube (Fig. 12–10).
Standing waves can occur in the air of any cavity, including the human throat, but
the frequencies present are complicated for any but very simple shapes such as the
uniform, narrow tube of a flute or an organ pipe. In some instruments, a vibrating
reed or the vibrating lip of the player helps to set up vibrations o
