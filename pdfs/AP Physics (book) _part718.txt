e balls exchange velocities as a result of the collision: ball B acquires
the velocity that ball A had before the collision, and vice versa.
(b) If ball B is at rest initially, so that  
we have
and
That is, ball A is brought to rest by the collision, whereas ball B acquires the
original velocity of ball A. See Fig. 7–14.
NOTE Our result in part (b) is often observed by billiard and pool players, and
is valid only if the two balls have equal masses (and no spin is given to the balls).

EXAMPLE 7;7
FIGURE 7;14 In this multiflash photo of a head-on
collision between two balls of equal mass, the white
cue ball is accelerated from rest by the cue stick and
then strikes the red ball, initially at rest. The white 
ball stops in its tracks, and the (equal-mass) red ball
moves off with the same speed as the white ball had
before the collision. See Example
