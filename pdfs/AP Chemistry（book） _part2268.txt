ume that most of the NOBr2 falls apart according to this reac-
tion. Thus, we have both the forward and reverse reactions of step 1 occurring much faster 
than step 2. Because they occur rapidly relative to step 2, the forward and reverse reactions 
of step 1 establish an equilibrium. As in any other dynamic equilibrium, the rate of the 
forward reaction equals that of the reverse reaction:
k3NO43Br24  =   k-13NOBr24
Solving for 3NOBr24, we have
3NOBr24 = k1
k-1
 3NO43Br24
Substituting this relationship into Equation 14.30, we have
Rate = k2
k1
k-1
3NO43Br243NO4 = k3NO423Br24
where the experimental rate constant k equals k2k1>k-1. This expression is consistent 
with the experimental rate law (Equation 14.27). Thus, our alternative mechanism 
(Equation 14.29), which involves two steps but only unimolecular and bimolecu-
lar processes, is far more probable than the single-step termolecular mechanism of 
Equation 14.28.
 
In general, whenever a fast step precedes a slow one, we can solve
