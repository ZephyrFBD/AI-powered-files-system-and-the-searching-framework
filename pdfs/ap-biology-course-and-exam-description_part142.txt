ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

Heritable information provides for continuity of life.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the events that 
occur in the cell cycle.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.B.1
In eukaryotes, cells divide and transmit genetic 
information via two highly regulated processes.
IST-1.B.2
The cell cycle is a highly regulated series of 
events for the growth and reproduction of cellsâ€” 
a. The cell cycle consists of sequential stages 
of interphase (G1, S, G2), mitosis, and 
cytokinesis.
b. A cell can enter a stage (G0) where it no 
longer divides, but it can reenter the cell 
cycle in response to appropriate cues. 
Nondividing cells may exit the cell cycle or be 
held at a particular stage in the cell cycle.
