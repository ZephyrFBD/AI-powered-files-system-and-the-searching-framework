onal to the
change in entropy during any process.
A natural outcome of the degradation of energy is the prediction that as time
goes on, the universe should approach a state of maximum disorder. Matter would
become a uniform mixture, and heat would have flowed from high-temperature
regions to low-temperature regions until the whole universe is at one temperature.
No work could then be done. All the energy of the universe would have degraded
to thermal energy. This prediction, called the heat death of the universe, has been
much discussed, but it would lie very far in the future. It is a complicated subject,
and some scientists question whether thermodynamics, as we now understand it,
actually applies to the universe as a whole, which is at a much larger scale.†

†When a star, like our Sun, loses energy by radiation, it becomes hotter (not cooler). By losing energy,
gravity is able to compress the gas of which the Sun is made—becoming
