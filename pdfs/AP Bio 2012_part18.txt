rmax = maximum per capita growth

Surface Area and Volume 
 
Volume of Sphere
V =  4/3  r3                       
 
Volume of a cube (or square column)
V = l w h 
 
Volume of a column
V =  r2 h 
 
Surface area of a sphere
A = 4  r2 
 
Surface area of a cube
A = 6 a  
 
Surface area of a rectangular solid
A =  (surface area of each side) 
r = radius  
l = length 
h = height 
w = width 
A = surface area 
V = volume 
=Sum of all 
a = surface area 
of one side of the 
cube 
Water Potential ()
 
 = p + s  
 
p = pressure potential 
 
s = solute potential 
 
The water potential will be equal to 
the solute potential of a solution in an 
open container, since the pressure 
potential of the solution in an open 
container is zero.   
 
The Solute Potential of the Solution 
s = – iCRT 
 
i = ionization constant (For sucrose 
this is 1.0 because sucrose does not 
ionize in water) 
 
C= molar concentration 
 
R= pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter 
bars/m
