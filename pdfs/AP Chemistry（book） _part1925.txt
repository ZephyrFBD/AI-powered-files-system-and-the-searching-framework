Polymers 
501
Some polymers, such as nylon and polyesters, both of which are thermosetting plas-
tics, can be formed into fibers that, like hair, are very long relative to their cross-sectional 
area. These fibers can be woven into fabrics and cords and fashioned into clothing, tire 
cord, and other useful objects.
Making Polymers
A good example of a polymerization reaction is the formation of polyethylene from 
ethylene molecules (Figure 12.35). In this reaction, the double bond in each ethylene 
molecule “opens up,” and two of the electrons originally in this bond are used to form 
new C ¬C single bonds with two other ethylene molecules. This type of polymeriza-
tion, in which monomers are coupled through their multiple bonds, is called addition 
polymerization.
We can write the equation for
