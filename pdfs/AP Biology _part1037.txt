Radioactive glucose is absorbed by the body in the same way
that nonradioactive, normal glucose is. It is used for cellular
respiration to provide ATP for all of a cell’s activities, and the
amount of glucose absorbed is a function of how active a cell is.
Brain cells are always active, even when you are asleep, but
they uptake even more glucose when you are engaged in a
specific task. In this experiment, the task was identifying names
of people, and an increase in glucose absorption indicated
increased activity in the brain cells of the hippocampus.
Refer to the graph below:
From looking at the Exercise Group bars and the Resting Group
bars for both Visit 1 and Visit 2 on the graph, it looks like the
Exercise Group did better than the Resting Group on the
memory task on both visits. However, it is important to look
deeper—specifically, at the error bars. With respect to Visit 1,
the error bars overlap at the upper limit of the Resting Group
bar (0.78) and on the lower limit o
