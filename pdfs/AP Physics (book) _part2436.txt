t relates electric field to its source,
electric charge (
Gauss’s law, Section 16–12);
(2) a similar law for the magnetic field, except that magnetic field lines are always
continuous—they do not begin or end (as electric field lines do, on charges);
(3) an electric field is produced by a changing magnetic field (Faraday’s law);
(4) a magnetic field is produced by an electric current (Ampère’s law), or by a
changing electric field.
Law (3) is Faraday’s law (see Chapter 21, especially Section 21–4). The first part
of law (4), that a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, was discovered by
Oersted, and the mathematical relation is given by Ampère’s law (Section 20–8).
But the second part of law (4) is an entirely new aspect predicted by Maxwell:
Maxwell argued that if a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, as
given by Faraday’s law, then the reverse might be true as well: a changing electric
field will produce a magnetic field. This was an hypothesis by Maxwell
