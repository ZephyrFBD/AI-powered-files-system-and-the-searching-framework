uction, is a continuous
process that starts at puberty. It begins as luteinizing hormone (LH)
induces the interstitial cells of the testes to produce testosterone.
Together with FSH, testosterone induces maturation of the seminiferous
tubules and stimulates the beginning of sperm production. In the
seminiferous tubules, each spermatogonium cell (2n) divides by mitosis
to produce two primary spermatocytes (2n). (For ease of understanding
and in order to keep the figure as simple and clear as possible, Figure 18.5
below only shows one primary spermatocyte undergoing meiosis.) Each
undergoes meiosis I to produce two secondary spermatocytes (n). Each
secondary spermatocyte then undergoes meiosis II, which yields 4
spermatids (n). These spermatids differentiate and move to the
epididymis where they become motile.
