d, they drew in air from the pipette,
and the level of the water in the pipette moved downward.
Below is a graph that shows the predicted data from this
experiment.
The glass beads were a control and showed no respiration. The
non-respiring (dry or dormant) seeds showed what looked like
a tiny amount of respiration, but that was probably just an odd
response to having gotten wet during the experiment. The
respiring (sprouted) seeds at 25°C showed a greater rate of
respiration than the respiring (sprouted) seeds at 0°C because
the increase in temperature caused an increased rate of enzyme
activity, which sped up all reactions within the respiring seeds.
Using the same apparatus, I could replace the peas with fruit
flies. Fruit flies are small, and the container is large enough to
provide them with adequate oxygen. I would place one
respirometer tube in 0°C of water and the other respirometer
tube in water that is 25°C. The flies in the respirometer tube
that is 25°C would have a faster
