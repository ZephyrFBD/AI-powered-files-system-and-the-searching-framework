s eventually
slow down and stop. Explain.
15. Can the diver of Fig. 8–28 do a somersault without having
any initial rotation when she leaves the board? Explain.
16. When a motorcyclist leaves the ground on a jump and
leaves the throttle on (so the rear wheel spins), why does
the front of the cycle rise up?
17. A shortstop may leap into the air to catch a ball and throw
it quickly. As he throws the ball, the upper part of his body
rotates. If you look quickly you will notice that his hips and
legs rotate in the opposite direction (Fig. 8–35). Explain.

CHAPTER 8
Rotational Motion
7. This book has three symmetry axes through its center, all
mutually perpendicular. The book’s moment of inertia
would be smallest about which of the three? Explain.
8. Can the mass of a rigid object be considered concentrated
at its CM for rotational motion? Explain.
9. The moment of inertia of a rotating solid disk about an axis
through its CM is 
(Fig. 8–20c). Suppose instead that
a parallel axis of rota
