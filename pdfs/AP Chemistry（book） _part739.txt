Sample Exercise 5.5 
Relating Heat, Temperature Change, and Heat Capacity
(a) How much heat is needed to warm 250 g of water (about 1 cup) from 22 °C (about room temperature) to 98 °C (near its 
boiling point)? (b) What is the molar heat capacity of water?
SOLUTION
Analyze In part (a) we must find the quantity of heat (q) needed 
to warm the water, given the mass of water (m), its temperature 
change 1∆T2, and its specific heat 1Cs2. In part (b) we must calcu-
late the molar heat capacity (heat capacity per mole, Cm) of water 
from its specific heat (heat capacity per gram).
Plan (a) Given Cs, m, and ∆T, we can calculate the quantity of 
heat, q, using Equat
