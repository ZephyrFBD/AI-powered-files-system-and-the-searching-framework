of ∆G° to calculate the Ksp values for the two salts at 298 K. (d) Sodium chloride is considered a soluble salt, whereas silver 
chloride is considered insoluble. Are these descriptions consistent with the answers to part (c)? (e) How will ∆G° for the solution 
process of these salts change with increasing T 
? What effect should this change have on the solubility of the salts?

Putting Concepts Together
SOLUTION
(a) We will use Equation 19.14 along with ∆Gf° values from Ap-
pendix C to calculate the ∆G°
soln values for each equilibrium. 
(As we did in Section 13.1, we use the subscript “soln” to indi-
cate that these are thermodynamic quantities for the forma-
tion of a solution.) We find
 ∆G°
soln1NaCl2 = 1-261.9 kJ>mol2 + 1-131.2 kJ>mol2
- 1-384.0 kJ>mol2
 = -9.1 kJ>mol
 ∆G°
soln1AgCl2 = 1+77.11 kJ>mol2 + 1-131.2 kJ>mol2
   - 1-109.70 kJ>mol2
 = +55.6 kJ>mol
(b) We can write ∆G°
soln as the sum of an enthalpy term, ∆H°
soln, 
and an entropy term, -T∆S°
