 Thus, the correct answer is (D). (A) is incorrect
because nondisjunction does not occur in interphase. (B) is incorrect
because nondisjunction in mitosis results in diploid (2N) cells, not
gametes, which are haploid (N). (C) is incorrect because
nondisjunction in meiosis I will result in two (N+1) gametes and two (N
–1) gametes.

Matter and energy are conserved in ecosystems. When consuming
phytoplankton, zooplankton take in 160 g/m2. The amount of carbon
released into the atmosphere through cellular respiration is 60 g/m2,
and 8 g/m2 are transferred to the small fish that consume
zooplankton. Therefore, the amount of carbon that is transferred back
to decomposers is 160 – 60 – 8 = 92 g/m2, so (D) is correct.

According to the information provided, producers pass on about 1% of
their available energy to primary consumers, who in turn pass on
about 10% of their available energy to secondary consumers. That
means that about 90% of the energy available for primary consumers
is
