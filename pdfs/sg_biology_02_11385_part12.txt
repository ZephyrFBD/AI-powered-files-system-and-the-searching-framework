ariables constant or indicated that all variables other than the independent variable 
are held constant. To earn the point for listing the variables being held constant, the student had to list 
at least two. 
1 point  Verified results with reasonable sample size (at least two bombats in each group), and/or repeated 
trials.  With repeated trials, the point was not awarded if the same bombat was used over and over. 
1 point  “Measured,” “recorded,” etc. (using quantitative terminology) bombat activity levels (dependent 
variable). If the student used the verb “observe,” then some measurement activity had to be specified. 
1 point  Included a mathematical and/or statistical comparison of control and experimental groups, or of 
observed and expected results. A specific kind of inferential statistic (chi square, t-test, etc.) did not 
need to be mentioned. A comparison of slopes of curves on a graph was also acceptable.
