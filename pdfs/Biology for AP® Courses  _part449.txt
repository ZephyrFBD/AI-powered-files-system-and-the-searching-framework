brane or endoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein
synthesis. Mitochondria participate in cellular respiration; they are responsible for the majority of ATP produced in the
cell. Peroxisomes hydrolyze fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles are storage and transport
compartments. In plant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.
Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The centrosome has two bodies perpendicular to each other, the
centrioles, and has an unknown purpose in cell division. Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells.
Plant cells and plant-like cells each have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary
component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis takes place
in chloroplasts. The central vacuole can expand without having to produce more cytoplasm.
