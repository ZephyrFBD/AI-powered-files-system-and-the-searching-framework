contrasting
alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive
allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on
homologous chromosome pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant
and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). The
recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals (Table 12.4).
