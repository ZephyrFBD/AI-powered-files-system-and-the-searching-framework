Community Hubs
Insert paragraph text here.OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education
(ISKME) to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons – a platform for instructors to share community-created resources
that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or
download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant
course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an
opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.
