weaken and coordination is effected, and eventually paralysis occurs.

ALS degenerates motor neurons that control voluntary muscle movement. As the lateral portion of the spine
that controls muscle movement hardens, signals are no longer sent to muscles. Initially, muscles weaken and
coordination is effected, and eventually paralysis occurs.
Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Neurodevelopmental disorders occur when the development of the nervous system is disturbed. There are several different
classes of neurodevelopmental disorders. Some, like Down Syndrome, cause intellectual deficits. Others specifically
affect communication, learning, or the motor system. Some disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder have complex symptoms.
