(A) is incorrect because too
much insulin would cause low blood sugar, not high blood sugar. Since
insulin release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood
glucose levels, it is unlikely that the presence of bacteria that also
release insulin in response to increased blood glucose levels would
completely stop the animal’s insulin production, eliminating (B).
Finally, the bacteria would not be able to sense that their insulin
secretion was killing their host, so they would have no cause for
downregulating it. Moreover, bacteria are incapable of simply
eliminating plasmids that contain “unnecessary” genes. As a result, (D)
is also incorrect.

Transduction is the process by which genetic material is transferred
from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage, either through
generalized or specific transduction. Thus, (D) is correct.
Transformation is the process by which a bacterial cell takes up foreign
DNA from its surroundings. Naturally, this oc
