Consider the following blood group data taken from a population in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the alleles responsible for
diﬀerent blood factors. All individuals in the population possess two
diﬀerent blood factors, each coded for by a dominant allele and a
recessive allele. For the first blood factor, allele R is dominant to allele r,
so both RR and Rr individuals test as blood type R, while rr individuals
test as blood type r. For the second blood factor, allele F is dominant to
allele f, so both FF and Ff individuals test as blood type F, while ﬀ
individuals test as blood type f. The frequencies observed for blood type
in the population are as follows:
Blood Types

R and F
0.60
R and f
0.15
r and F
0.24
r and f
