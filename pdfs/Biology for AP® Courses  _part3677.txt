1.3b. Exchange of fluids is assisted by the pulsing of the jellyfish body.
Figure 31.3 Simple animals consisting of a single cell layer such as the (a) sponge or only a few cell layers such as
the (b) jellyfish do not have a circulatory system. Instead, gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged by diffusion.
For more complex organisms, diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases, nutrients, and waste effectively through the
body; therefore, more complex circulatory systems evolved. Most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory
systems. In an open system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions
help to move fluids. The larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push
blood through their bodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and
are able to move rapidly to catch prey. Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of verte
