cid-dissociation constant, Ka, which is the equilibrium constant 
for the reaction HA1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + A-1aq2, which can also be 
written as HA1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆H3O+1aq2 + A-1aq2. The larger 
the value of Ka, the stronger is the acid. For solutions of the same 
concentration, a stronger acid also has a larger percent ionization. 
The concentration of a weak acid and its Ka value can be used to 
calculate the pH of a solution.
Polyprotic acids, such as H3PO4, have more than one ionizable 
proton. These acids have acid-dissociation constants that decrease 
in magnitude in the order Ka1 7 Ka2 7 Ka3. Because nearly all the 
H+1aq2 in a polyprotic acid solution comes from the first dissociation 
step, the pH can usually be estimated satisfactorily by considering 
only Ka1. Weak bases include NH3, amines, and the anions of weak ac-
ids. The extent to which a weak base reacts with water to generate the 
corresponding conjugate acid and OH- is measured by the base-dis-
sociation constant, Kb. Kb is
