el-plate capacitor (Section 17–9). If the voltage on the
capacitor is to be 850 V, what is the required capacitance?
(d) If this capacitor were to be made from activated carbon
(Section 17–7), the voltage would be limited to no more
than 10 V. In this case, how many grams of activated carbon
would be required? (e) Is this practical?
6. Capacitors can be used as “electric charge counters.” Con-
sider an initially uncharged capacitor of capacitance C with
its bottom plate grounded and its top plate connected to a
source of electrons. (a) If N electrons flow onto the capacitor’s
top plate, show that the resulting potential difference V across
the capacitor is directly proportional to N. (b) Assume the
voltage-measuring device can accurately resolve voltage
changes of about 1 mV. What value of C would be necessary
to resolve the arrival of an individual electron? (c) Using
modern semiconductor technology, a micron-size capacitor
can be constructed with parallel conducting plates separated
