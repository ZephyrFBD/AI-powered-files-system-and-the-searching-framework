10. (II) A star is 21.6 light-years from Earth. How long would
it take a spacecraft traveling 0.950c to reach that star as
measured by observers: (a) on Earth, (b) on the spacecraft?
(c) What is the distance traveled according to observers 
on the spacecraft? (d) What will the spacecraft occupants
compute their speed to be from the results of (b) and (c)?
11. (II) A fictional news report stated that starship Enterprise
had just returned from a 5-year voyage while traveling at
0.70c. (a) If the report meant 5.0 years of Earth time, how
much time elapsed on the ship? (b) If the report meant
5.0 years of ship time, how much time passed on Earth?
12. (II) A box at rest has the shape of a cube 2.6 m on a side.
This box is loaded onto the flat floor of a spaceship and 
the spaceship then flies past us with a horizontal speed of
0.80c. What is the volume of the box as we observe it?
13. (III) Escape velocity from the Earth is 
What
would be the percent decrease in length of a 68.2-m-long
