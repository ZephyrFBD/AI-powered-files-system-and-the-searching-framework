principle of thermochemistry:
Energy is released when chemical bonds are formed;
energy is consumed when chemical bonds are broken.
You may be wondering how these same principles apply to molecular substances 
such as water, H2O, and methane, CH4, that do not contain cations and anions. As we 
will learn in Chapters 8 and 9, the atoms in a molecule are held together by covalent 
bonds. While the link to electrostatic potential energy is less obvious, the forces that 
underlie covalent bonds are also electrostatic in nature. Just like ionic bonds, energy 
must be provided to break covalent bonds and is released when they form.
5.2 ∣ The First Law of Thermodynamics
Energy comes in many different forms, including kinetic energy, which we encountered 
in Chapter 1, and various types of potential energy. You don’t have to look far to find 
processes that involve conversions from one form of energy to another. Dropping a stone 
down a deep well converts gravitational potential energy into ki
