light with wavelength
That light travels more slowly in matter than in vacuum can be explained at
the atomic level as being due to the absorption and reemission of light by atoms
and molecules of the material.

23–5 Refraction: Snell’s Law
When light passes from one transparent medium into another with a different
index of refraction, some or all of the incident light is reflected at the boundary.
The rest passes into the new medium. If a ray of light is incident at an angle to the
surface (other than perpendicular), the ray changes direction as it enters the new
medium. This change in direction, or bending, of the light ray is called refraction.
Figure 23–21a shows a ray passing from air into water. Angle 
is the angle
the incident ray makes with the normal (perpendicular) to the surface and is called
the angle
