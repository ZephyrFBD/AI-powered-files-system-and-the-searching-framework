However, because 
340-nm light falls in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
increasing the energy of the band gap will only shift the light deeper 
into the UV.

page 527 Entropy increases as the ink molecules disperse into 
water. page 528 The lattice energy of NaCl(s) must be overcome 
to separate Na+ and Cl- ions and disperse them into a solvent. 
C6H14 is nonpolar. Interactions between ions and nonpolar mol-
ecules tend to be very weak. Thus, the energy required to separate 
the ions in NaCl is not recovered in the form of ion–C6H14 interac-
tions. page 530 (a) Separating solvent molecules from each other 
requires energy and is therefore endothermic. (b) Forming the sol-
ute–solvent interactions is exothermic. page 531 The added solute 
provides a template for the solid to begin to crystallize from solu-
tion, and a precipitate will form. page 534 The solubility in  
water would be considerably lower because there would no longer  
be hydrogen bonding with wa
