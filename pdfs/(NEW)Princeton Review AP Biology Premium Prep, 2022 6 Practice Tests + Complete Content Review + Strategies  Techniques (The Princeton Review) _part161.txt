ice that only two amino acids contain the atom sulfur: methionine and cysteine.
We’ve included this reference page so you can familiarize yourself with these
common acids. But don’t worry! You don’t have to memorize all these
structures.
Polypeptides
When two amino acids join, they form a dipeptide. The carboxyl group of one amino acid combines with the amino
group of another amino acid. Here’s an example:
This is the same dehydration synthesis process we saw earlier. Why? Because a water molecule is removed to form
a bond. By the way, the bond between two amino acids has a special name—a peptide bond. If a group of amino
acids is joined together in a “string,” the resulting organic compound is called a polypeptide. Once a polypeptide
chain twists and folds on itself, it forms a three-dimensional structure called a protein.
Building a Chain
The new amino acid is always added on the carboxyl end of the existing chain.
The specific order of amino acids in a peptide can change the identit
