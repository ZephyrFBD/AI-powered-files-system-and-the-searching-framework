on to an earlier state. When the condition returns to its earlier state, the process is terminated. Negative
feedback is a mechanism that helps maintain homeostasis, or the maintenance of stable, internal conditions within
narrow limits. Every organ system uses this kind of regulation. An example follows:
For thermoregulation, humans respond to hot temperatures by sweating. Evaporation of water cools the body. When
the body returns to the set point temperature, sweating stops. Should body temperature drop below a comfortable
value, the body responds by shivering. Shivering stops when the body is adequately warmed. (An expanded review
of thermoregulation is provided later in this chapter.)
2. In positive feedback, a change in a condition initiates a process that intensifies the condition so that it is driven
further beyond normal limits. Although uncommon, some important positive feedback mechanisms occur.
