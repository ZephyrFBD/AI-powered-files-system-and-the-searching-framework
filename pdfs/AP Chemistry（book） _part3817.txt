presents a CH group, not a CH2 group.)
Carbon rings containing fewer than five carbon atoms are strained because the 
C ¬C ¬C bond angles must be less than the 109.5 
° tetrahedral angle. The amount of 
strain increases as the rings get smaller. In cyclopropane, which has the shape of an equi-
lateral triangle, the angle is only 60 
°; this molecule is therefore much more reactive than 
propane, its straight-chain analog.

The general formula for straight-chain alkanes is CnH2n +2.

(Table 24.2). There are two alkyl groups specified, an ethyl group 
(two carbon atoms, C2H5) and a methyl group (one carbon atom, 
CH3). Counting from left to right alo
