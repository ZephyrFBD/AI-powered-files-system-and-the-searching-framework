of the virus to infect the bacterium.
In 1961, Nirenberg and Matthaei conducted a series of
experiments to better understand the flow of genetic
information from gene to protein. They discovered that in
solutions containing the contents of ruptured E. coli
bacterial cells from which DNA had been removed,
polymers containing only one repeating amino acid,
phenylalanine, would be synthesized if synthetic mRNA
composed of only the single nucleotide, uracil (U), was
added to the solution in which phenylalanine was also
present. In solutions containing mRNA with only adenine
(A) or cytosine (C) and the amino acids lysine or proline,
polymers containing only these amino acids would be
synthesized. The researchers found that when ribosomes
were removed by filtration, these polymers did not form.
Nirenberg and Leder (1964) extended this work to include
other nucleotides.
