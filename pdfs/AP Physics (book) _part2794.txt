ntacts are placed directly on the cornea, we would not subtract out the 2.0 cm
for the image distances. That is, for distant objects 
so
The new near point would be 41 cm. Thus we see that a
contact lens and an eyeglass lens will require slightly different powers, or focal
lengths, for the same eye because of their different placements relative to the eye.
We also see that glasses in this case give a better near point than contacts.
EXERCISE C What power of contact lens is needed for an eye to see distant objects if its
far point is 25 cm?
Underwater Vision
When your eyes are under water, distant underwater objects look blurry because
at the water–cornea interface, the difference in indices of refraction is very small:
for water, 1.376 for the cornea. Hence light rays are bent very little and
are focused far behind the retina, Fig. 25–15a. If you wear goggles or a face mask,
you restore an air–cornea interface (
and 1.376, respectively) and the
rays can be focused, Fig. 25–15b.
