1 gives, for all the elements, the ground-state electron configurations 
for the outer-shell electrons. You can use this figure to check your answers as you 
practice writing electron configurations. We have written these configurations with 
 
orbitals listed in order of increasing principal quantum number. As we saw in Sample 
Exercise 6.9, the orbitals can also be listed in order of filling, as they would be read 
off of the periodic table.
Figure 6.31 allow us to reexamine the concept of valence electrons. Notice, for 
 
example, that as we proceed from Cl 13Ne43s23p52 to Br 13Ar43d104s24p52 we add a com-
plete subshell of 3d electrons to the electrons beyond the [Ar] core. Although the 3d 
electrons are outer-shell electrons, they are not involved in chemical bonding and are 
therefore not considered valence electrons. Thus, we consider only the 4s and 4p elec-
trons of Br to be valence electrons. Similarly, if we compare the electron configurations of 
Ag (element 47) and Au (ele
