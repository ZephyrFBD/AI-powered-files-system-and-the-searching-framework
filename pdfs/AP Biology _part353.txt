genes in vitro (in the laboratory). The branch
of science that uses recombinant DNA techniques for practical purposes
is called biotechnology or genetic engineering.
Many tools and techniques have been developed to manipulate and
engineer genes. The following sections contain a discussion of the uses for
genetic engineering, an explanation of some techniques that are used, and
a brief discussion of some ethical issues within the field.
The potential uses of recombinant DNA or gene cloning are many:
To produce a protein product, such as human insulin, in large
quantities as an inexpensive pharmaceutical.
To replace a nonfunctioning gene in a personâ€™s cells with a
functioning gene by gene therapy. Scientists are currently
conducting clinical trials in this area with disappointing results.
Sometimes the human subjects become ill from the viral vector
used to carry the gene. Other times, the gene is inserted successfully
and begins to produce the necessary protein but stops working in a
