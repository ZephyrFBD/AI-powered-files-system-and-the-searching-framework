mitochondria and chloroplasts are all characteristics of
prokaryotic cells. Choices (C) and (D) are eukaryotic cells because they both have linear chromosomes and
membrane-bound organelles.
34. (D) Cell D has both linear chromosomes and chloroplasts. Thus, of the four cells, cell D is most closely related
to modern plants. Choice (A) is incorrect because it has circular chromosomes, which are a characteristic of
prokaryotic cells. Choices (B) and (C) both do not contain chloroplasts, so neither is closely related to modern
plants.
35. (A) Two species that occupy different habitats cannot interbreed and will remain separate species. Choice (B) is
incorrect because temporal isolation occurs when organisms are active at different times of the day or have
breeding seasons at different times of the year. Behavioral isolation involves different mating behaviors, for
example mating dances or bird calls, so choice (C) is incorrect. Mechanical isolation occurs when
morphological differences pre
