balancing redox equations (Sections 20.1 and 20.2) earlier, 
after the introduction of redox reactions in Section 4.4. Finally, 
some instructors like to cover organic chemistry (Chapter 24) 
right after bonding (Chapters 8 and 9). This, too, is a largely 
seamless move.
We have brought students into greater contact with descrip-
tive organic and inorganic chemistry by integrating examples 
throughout the text. You will find pertinent and relevant exam-
ples of “real” chemistry woven into all the chapters to illustrate 
principles and applications. Some chapters, of course, more 
directly address the “descriptive” properties of elements and 
their compounds, especially Chapters 4, 7, 11, 18, and 22–24. We 
also incorporate descriptive organic and inorganic chemistry in 
the end-of-chapter exercises.
