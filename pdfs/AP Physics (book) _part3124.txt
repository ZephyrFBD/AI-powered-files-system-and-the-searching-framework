his: if we treat electrons (and other
particles) as if they were waves, then 
represents the wave amplitude. If we
treat them as particles, then we must treat them on a probabilistic basis. The
square of the wave function,
gives the probability of finding a given electron
at a given point. We cannot predict—or even follow—the path of a single 
electron precisely through space and time.
28–3 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
Whenever a measurement is made, some uncertainty is always involved. For
example, you cannot make an absolutely exact measurement of the length of a
table. Even with a measuring stick that has markings 1 mm apart, there will be an
inaccuracy of perhaps 
or so. More precise instruments will produce more
precise measurements. But there is always some uncertainty involved in a
measurement, no matter how good the measuring device. We expect that by
using more precise instruments, the uncertainty in a measurement can be made
indefinitely small.
But according to quantu
