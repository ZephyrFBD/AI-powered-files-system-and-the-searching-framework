-level diagram (Figure 9.41) for homonuclear 
diatomic molecules of the elements boron through neon, all of which have valence 2s 
and 2p atomic orbitals. The following features of the diagram are notable:
t The 2s atomic orbitals are substantially lower in energy than the 2p atomic orbitals. 
 (Section 6.7) Consequently, both MOs formed from the 2s orbitals are lower in 
energy than the lowest-energy MO derived from the 2p atomic orbitals.

▲ Figure 9.41  Energy-level diagram for MOs of period 2 homonuclear diatomic molecules. The 
diagram assumes no interaction between the 2s atomic orbital on one atom and the 2p atomic 
orbitals on the other atom, and experiment shows that it fits only for O2, F2, and Ne2.
