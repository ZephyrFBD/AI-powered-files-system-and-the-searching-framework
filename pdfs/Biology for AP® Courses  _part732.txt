by cellular conditions, such as temperature and pH. They are
also regulated through their location within a cell, sometimes being compartmentalized so that they can only catalyze
reactions under certain circumstances. Inhibition and activation of enzymes via other molecules are other important ways
that enzymes are regulated. Inhibitors can act competitively, noncompetitively, or allosterically; noncompetitive inhibitors
are usually allosteric. Activators can also enhance the function of enzymes allosterically. The most common method by
which cells regulate the enzymes in metabolic pathways is through feedback inhibition. During feedback inhibition, the
products of a metabolic pathway serve as inhibitors (usually allosteric) of one or more of the enzymes (usually the first
committed enzyme of the pathway) involved in the pathway that produces them.
