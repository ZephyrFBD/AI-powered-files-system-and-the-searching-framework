ontaining a cylindrical cage was used as an animal chamber. An opening at one end of the
chamber was sealed with a stopper. Passing through the stopper was a graduated burrette. Gas production or
consumption inside the chamber could be measured by movements of a solution rising or falling inside the burrette.
Potassium
hydroxide (KOH) was added to the chamber to absorb any CO2 produced.
Twenty hamsters were weighed and put into one of 20 chambers. Half of the chambers were maintained at 10°C,
and half were maintained at 25°C. Oxygen consumption in ml was recorded for each hamster every 30 seconds and
plotted as ml per gram of hamster weight. The data are shown in the graph that follows.
21. The data in the graph above are consistent with which of the
following conclusions?
 
A. As time progresses, respiration rate increases in hamsters.
B. The rate of respiration for hamsters increases with increases in environmental temperature.
C. Temperature increases with increases in the weights o
