both p-type and n-type semiconductors have no net charge on them.
According to the band theory (Section 29–7), in a doped semiconductor the
impurity provides additional energy states between the bands as shown in
Fig. 29–28. In an n-type semiconductor, the impurity energy level lies just below
the conduction band, Fig. 29–28a. Electrons in this energy level need only about
0.05 eV in Si to reach the conduction band which is on the order of the thermal
energy,
At room temperature, the small % of electrons
in this donor level 
can readily make the transition upward. This
energy level can thus supply electrons to the conduction band, so it is called a
donor level. In p-type semiconductors, the impurity energy level is just above the
valence band (Fig. 29–28b). It is called an acceptor level because electrons from
the valence band can jump into it with only average thermal energy. Positive
holes are left behind in the valence band, and as other electrons move into these
holes, the holes mo
