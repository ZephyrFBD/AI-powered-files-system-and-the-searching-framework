incorrect because NAD+ is not reduced and oxygen is not produced during oxidative phosphorylation.
6. (B) The vast majority of ATP produced in cellular respiration is produced by chemiosmosis (approximately 34
ATPs per glucose molecule!), and glycolysis and the Krebs cycle each produce a net gain of 2 ATPs per glucose
molecule. Choice (A) is incorrect because the oxidation of pyruvate does not produce any ATP. Fermentation
does not produce ATP, so choices (C) and (D) are incorrect.
7. (B) Oxygen is the final (or terminal) electron acceptor in cellular respiration; oxygen combines with electrons
and protons to form water. While carbon dioxide is a product of cellular respiration, oxygen does not combine
with carbon during cellular respiration to produce carbon dioxide. Thus, choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (C) is
incorrect because oxygen neither removes carbon from glucose nor does it form pyruvate during cellular
respiration. Removing a carbon from pyruvate to form an alcohol is what h
