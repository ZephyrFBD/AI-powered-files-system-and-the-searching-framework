 mutant allele is expressed as black (b). The second mutation, for wing structure, transforms normal
wings (V) into vestigial wings (v) (small, underdeveloped, and nonfunctional). (Note that for Drosophila mutations,
the gene notation uses letters that denote the name for the mutation.) Since these two genes are linked, a fly
heterozygous for a gray body and normal wings (called gray-normal), indicated by BbVv, would have the BV on one
chromosome and the bv on the homologous chromosome. If the linkage between these genes were not known, then
the expected results from a cross between this gray-normal fly (BbVv) and a black fly with vestigial wings (called
black-vestigial, bbvv) would be ¼BbVv, ¼bbvv, ¼Bbvv, and ¼bbVv (Figure 8-6). However, since the two genes are
on the same chromosome and cannot assort independently, the gray-normal fly produces only two kinds of gametes,
BV and bv. Bv and bV gametes are not produced. Taking linkage into consideration, the expected offspring would be
