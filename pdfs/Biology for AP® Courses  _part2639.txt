nown as the mesophyll, or “middle leaf.” The mesophyll of most
leaves typically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells: the palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma (Figure
23.26). The palisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may
be present in one, two, or three layers. Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape.
These are the cells of the spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma
cells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. In aquatic plants, the
intercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma help the leaf float. Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts.
Guard cells are the only epidermal cells to contain chloroplasts.
