 the prokaryotes and eukaryotes use similar organelles, namely, mitochondria.
b.
Yes, because it suggests the eukaryotes possess traits that were likely conserved from prokaryotic ancestors.
c.
No, because mitochondrial DNA is very different from the DNA within a eukaryote’s nucleus.
d.
No, because mitochondrial DNA is not used by the eukaryotic cells.
Clades can vary in size depending on which branch point is being referenced. The important factor is that all of the
organisms in the clade or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. This can be remembered because
monophyletic breaks down into “mono,” meaning one, and “phyletic,” meaning evolutionary relationship. Figure 20.11
shows various examples of clades. Notice how each clade comes from a single point, whereas the non-clade groups show
branches that do not share a single point.
