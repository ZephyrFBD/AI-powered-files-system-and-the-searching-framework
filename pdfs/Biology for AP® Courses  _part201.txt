ll” on the water column. This pull results from the
tendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them,
and so they are pulled along. Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves.
Without these properties of water, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require. In
another example, insects such as the water strider, shown in Figure 2.19, use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on
the surface layer of water and even mate there.

Activity
During a process called transpiration, water evaporates through a plant’s leaves. Water in the ground travels
up from the roots to the leaves.
