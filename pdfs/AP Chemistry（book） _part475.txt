allium reacts with arsenic to form the semiconductor, 
gallium arsenide, GaAs, used in light–emitting diodes and 
solar cells:
Ga1l2 + As1s2 ¡ GaAs1s2
If 4.00 g of gallium is reacted with 5.50 g of arsenic, how many 
grams of the excess reactant are left at the end of the reaction? 
(a) 1.20 g As (b) 1.50 g As (c) 4.30 g As (d) 8.30 g Ga
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
When a 2.00-g strip of zinc metal is placed in an aqueous  
solution containing 2.50 g of silver nitrate, the reaction is
Zn1s2 + 2 AgNO31aq2 ¡ 2 Ag1s2 + Zn1NO3221aq2
(a) Which reactant is limiting? (b) How many grams of  
Ag form? (c) How many grams of Zn1NO322 form? (d) How 
many grams of the excess reactant are left at the end of the 
reaction?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to calculate the amount of a product, given 
the amounts of two reactants, so this is a limiting reactant problem.
Plan To identify the limiting reactant, we can calculate the number 
of moles of each reactant and compare their ratio with the ratio of 
coef
