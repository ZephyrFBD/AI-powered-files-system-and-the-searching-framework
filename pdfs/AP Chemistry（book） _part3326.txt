alf-reactions and overall cell reaction repre-
sented by Zn& Zn2+ & & H+ &H2; calculate the standard cell emf 
using data in Appendix E and use Pt for the hydrogen elec-
trode. (c) Using the notation just described, represent a cell 
based on the following reaction:
ClO3
-1aq2 + 3 Cu1s2 + 6 H+1aq2
 
¡ Cl-1aq2 + 3 Cu2+1aq2 + 3 H2O1l2
Pt is used as an inert electrode in contact with the ClO3
- 
and Cl-. Calculate the standard cell emf given: ClO3
-1aq2 +
6 H+1aq2 + 6 e- ¡ Cl-1aq2 + 3 H2O1l2; E° = 1.45 V.
 
20.99  Predict whether the following reactions will be spon-
taneous in acidic solution under standard conditions: 
 
(a) oxidation of Sn to Sn2+ by I2 (to form I-), (b) reduction 
of Ni2+ to Ni by I- (to form I2), (c) reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ 
by H2O2, (d) reduction of Cu2+ to Cu by Sn2+ (to form Sn4+).
