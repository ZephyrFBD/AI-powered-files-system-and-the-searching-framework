 energy is transformed to
thermal energy (via collisions 
between moving electrons and atoms
of the wire), which causes the wire’s
temperature to become so high that 
it glows. In halogen lamps
(tungsten–halogen), shown on the
right, the tungsten filament is
surrounded by a halogen gas such as
bromine or iodine in a clear tube.
Halogens, via chemical reactions,
restore many of the tungsten atoms
that were evaporated from the 
hot filament, allowing longer life,
higher temperature (typically 2900 K
versus 2700 K), better efficiency, and
whiter light.
Electric current and electric power
in electric circuits are of basic
importance in everyday life. We
examine both dc and ac in this
Chapter, and include the microscopic
analysis of electric current.
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
The conductors shown are all made of copper and are at the same temperature.
Which conductor would have the greatest resistance to the flow of charge entering
from the left? Which would offer the least resist
