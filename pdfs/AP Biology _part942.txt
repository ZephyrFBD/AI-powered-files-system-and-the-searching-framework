parameters to measure in this type of experiment are O2
consumption, or the amount of CO2 that is given off, not CO2
consumption.
(A) Choice B is incorrect because prokaryotes do not have internal

volume ratio of cells varies with the cellâ€™s size. Smaller cells have a
greater surface-to-volume ratio.
(C) UAA codes for a stop sequence. Translation would cease at that
point in the process.
(B) Rainforests are responsible for the cycle of rain, absorption of
