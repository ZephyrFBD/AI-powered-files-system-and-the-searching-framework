survival possible) depends entirely on the prey population. 
•  The rate of change of a population is proportional to its size. 
Generally, these assumptions will not affect the basic generation of a model because they 
are embedded implicitly. 
■ Part 3: The FOXRAB Game: 
Abstracting the Word Equations into Arithmetic Equations 
Word equation (1): The change in the rabbit population is equal to plus one-half the 
original number of rabbits minus an estimate of the interaction between rabbits and foxes 
in this environment.

Where Ri is the initial number of rabbits and Fi is the initial number of foxes, ΔR is the 
change in the size of the rabbit population. 
Similarly, word equation (2): The change in the fox population is equal to minus one-
quarter the original number of foxes plus an estimate of the interaction between rabbits and 
foxes in this environment. 
Arithmetic equation (2): ΔF = -(1/4)Fi + (1/40)RiFi 
As before, Fi is the initial number of foxes and Ri is the ini
