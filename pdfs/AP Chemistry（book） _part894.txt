If the frequency of the incoming light 
is increased, will the energy of the 
ejected electrons increase, decrease, 
or stay the same?

CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
The idea that the energy of light depends on its frequency helps us understand 
the diverse effects that different kinds of electromagnetic radiation have on matter. For 
 
example, because of the high frequency (short wavelength) of X rays (Figure 6.4), X-ray 
photons cause tissue damage, which is why warning signs are posted around X-ray 
equipment.
Although Einstein’s theory of light as a stream of photons rather than a wave 
explains the photoelectric effect and a great many other observations, it also poses 
a dilemma. Is light a wave, or does it consist of particles? The only way to resolve this 
dilemma is to adopt what might seem to be a bizarre position: We must consider that 
light possesses both wave-like and particle-like characterist
