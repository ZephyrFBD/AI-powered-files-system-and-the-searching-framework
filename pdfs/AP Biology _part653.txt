OSMOREGULATION
Osmoregulation is the management of the body’s water and solute
concentration. Organisms in different environments face different
problems maintaining the proper concentration of body fluids.
For marine vertebrates, like bony fish, the ocean is a strongly
dehydrating environment because it is very hypertonic to the organisms

living in it. Fish constantly lose water through their gills and skin to the
surrounding environment. To counteract the problem, they produce very
little urine and drink large amounts of seawater. The extra salt that is taken
in with the seawater is actively transported out through the gills.
The osmoregulation problems faced by freshwater organisms are the
opposite of those living in salt water. The environment is hypotonic to the
organisms, and they are constantly gaining water and losing salt.
Freshwater fish excrete copious amounts of dilute urine.
