tion, the number of the vaccines sent to 
the epidemic areas in one week equals to the number of one-week output of 
the medication. With the advance of technology, supply will first grow with 
high-increasing speed and then grows with low-increasing speed. Finally, the 
speed will become stable as a result of more and more constraints. When 
supply meets demand, though more medication is able to be produced, supply 
will change with the demand in the future in order to avoid waste.  
4.3 Delivery model: 
Our delivery model consists of vertical transport（drugs distribute from the 
treatment center to epidemic areas）and lateral transport(drugs distribute from 
one epidemic area to another). We take Sierra Leone as an example, making 
assumptions that one week is a vertical transport cycle and every country has 
one treatment center. During every vertical transport cycle, we use lateral 
transport. Firstly, we estimate the weight of each city in country according to 
the infective and su
