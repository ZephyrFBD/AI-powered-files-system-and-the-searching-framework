he pH of most natural waters containing living organisms is between 6.5 and 
8.5, but as Figure 18.8 shows, freshwater pH values are far below 6.5 in many parts of 
the continental United States. At pH levels below 4.0, all vertebrates, most inverte-
brates, and many microorganisms are destroyed. The lakes most susceptible to damage 
are those with low concentrations of basic ions, such as HCO3
-, that would act as a 
buffer to minimize changes in pH. Some of these lakes are recovering as sulfur emis-
sions from fossil fuel combustion decrease, in part because of the Clean Air Act. In 
the period 1980â€“2014 the average ambient air concentration of SO2 nationwide has 
declined by 80%.
Because acids react with metals and with carbonates, acid rain is corrosive both to 
metals and to stone building materials. Marble and limestone, for example, whose major 
constituent is CaCO3, are readily attacked by acid rain (Figure 18.9). Billions of dollars 
each year are lost because of corrosion due
