ecretes materials to the
outside of the cell.
ii. Endocytosis—the cell takes in the molecules via vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane.
iii. Pinocytosis—uptake of liquids
iv. Phagocytosis—uptake of solids

Energy
I.
Chemistry of Life—Energy Changes
A. Energy—capacity to do work.
1. First Law of Thermodynamics—energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can change from one
form to another and be transferred.
Example: Plants convert light energy from the sun to make glucose, a form of chemical energy.
2. Second Law of Thermodynamics—every energy transfer increases entropy of the universe (disorder).
i.
All living systems will not violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
B. Free Energy—energy available in a system to do work; organisms need this free energy to maintain
organization, to grow, and to reproduce.
1. Exergonic reactions release free energy.
i.
In catabolic reactions, reactant(s) are broken down to produce product(s) containing le
