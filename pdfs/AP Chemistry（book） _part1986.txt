b) “Al-
loy” is just another word for “a chemical compound of fixed 
composition that is made of two or more metals.” (c) Interme-
tallics are compounds of two or more metals that have a defi-
nite composition and are not considered alloys. (d) If you mix 
two metals together and, at the atomic level, they separate into 
two or more different compositional phases, you have created 
a heterogeneous alloy. (e) Alloys can be formed even if the at-
oms that comprise them are rather different in size.
 12.42  Determine if each statement is true or false: (a) Substitu-
tional alloys are solid solutions, but interstitial alloys are 
heterogenous alloys. (b) Substitutional alloys have “solute” 
atoms that replace “solvent” atoms in a lattice, but intersti-
tial alloys have “solute” atoms that are in between the “sol-
vent” atoms in a lattice. (c) The atomic radii of the atoms 
in a substitutional alloy are similar to each other, but in an 
interstitial alloy, the interstitial atoms are a lot s
