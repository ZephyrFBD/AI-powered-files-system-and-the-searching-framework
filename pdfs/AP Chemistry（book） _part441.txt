the chemical formula for calcium nitrate is Ca1NO322. Adding the 
atomic weights of the elements in the compound gives a formula 
weight of 164.1 amu. Using 1 mol Ca1NO322 = 164.1 g Ca1NO322 
to write the appropriate conversion factor, we have
Grams Ca1NO322 = 10.433 mol Ca(NO322)a
164.1 g Ca1NO322
1 mol Ca1NO322
b
= 71.1 g Ca1NO322
Check The number of moles is less than 1, so the number of grams 
must be less than the molar mass, 164.1 g. Using rounded num-
bers to estimate, we have 0.5 * 150 = 75 g, which means the 
magnitude of our answer is reasonable. Both the units (g) and the 
number of significant figures (3) are correct.
 
Check Because 5.380 g is less than the molar mass, an answer less 
than 1 mol is reasonable. The unit mol is appropriate. The original 
data had four significant figures, so our answer has four significant 
figures.
