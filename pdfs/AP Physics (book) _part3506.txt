1–8 Emission Tomography:
PET and SPECT
The images formed using the standard techniques of nuclear medicine, as briefly
discussed in the previous Section, are produced from radioactive tracer sources
within the volume of the body. It is also possible to image the radioactive
emissions from a single plane or slice through the body using the computed
tomography techniques discussed in Section 25–12. A gamma camera measures
the radioactive intensity from the tracer at many points and angles around the
patient. The data are processed in much the same way as for X-ray CT scans
(Section 25–12). This technique is referred to as single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT), or simply SPET (single photon emission tomography).
Another important technique is positron emission tomography (PET),
which makes use of positron emitters such as
