ches the ground below.
5. Examine x and y motions. In the horizontal (x) direction, the acceleration
so the velocity is constant. The value of x when the motorcycle
reaches the ground is
In the vertical direction, the accelera-
tion is the acceleration due to gravity,
The value of
y when the motorcycle reaches the ground is
The initial veloc-
ity is horizontal and is our unknown,
the initial vertical velocity is zero,
6. List knowns and unknowns. See the Table in the margin. Note that in addition
to not knowing the initial horizontal velocity 
(which stays constant until
landing), we also do not know the time 
when the motorcycle reaches the
ground.
7. Apply relevant equations.The motorcycle maintains constant 
as long as it
is in the air. The time it stays in the air is determined by the y motionâ€”when
it reaches the ground. So we first find the time using the y motion, and then
use this time value in the x equations. To find out how long it takes the
motorcycle to reach the ground bel
