65. Consider the street pattern shown in Fig. 2â€“46. Each inter-
section has a traffic signal, and the speed limit is 
Suppose you are driving from the west at the speed limit.
When you are 10.0 m from the first intersection, all the lights
turn green. The lights are green for 13.0 s each. (a) Calculate
the time needed to reach the third stoplight. Can you make
it through all three lights without stopping? (b) Another car
was stopped at the first light when all the lights turned green.
It can accele
