ed carbon and reduced energy carriers. 
 
 
  As shown in the diagram above, when there is low fixed nitrogen in the environment, an increase in the 
concentration of free calcium ions and 2-oxyglutarate stimulates the expression of genes that produce  
two transcription factors (NtcA and HetR) that promote the expression of genes responsible for heterocyst 
development. HetR also causes production of a signal, PatS, that prevents adjacent cells from developing as 
heterocysts. 
  Based on your understanding of the ways in which signal transmission mediates cell function, which of the 
following predictions is most consistent with the information given above? 
(A) In an environment with low fixed nitrogen, treating the Anabaena cells with a calcium-binding compound 
should prevent heterocyst differentiation. 
(B) A strain that overexpresses the patS gene should develop many more heterocysts in a low fixed nitrogen 
environment. 
(C) In an environment with abundant fixed nitrogen, free
