and the mass number by 4; beta emission, which increases the atomic 
number by 1 and leaves the mass number unchanged; and positron 
emission and electron capture, both of which reduce the atomic num-
ber by 1 and leave the mass number unchanged.
PATTERNS OF NUCLEAR STABILITY (SECTION 21.2) The 
neutron-to-proton ratio is an important factor determining nu-
clear stability. By comparing a nuclideâ€™s neutron-to-proton ratio 
with those of stable nuclei, we can predict the mode of radioactive 
decay. In general, neutron-rich nuclei tend to emit beta particles; 
proton-rich nuclei tend to either emit positrons or undergo electron 
capture; and heavy nuclei tend to emit alpha particles. The presence 
of magic numbers of nucleons and an even number of protons and 
neutrons also help determine the stability of a nucleus. A nuclide 
may undergo a series of decay steps before a stable nuclide forms. 
This series of steps is called a radioactive decay chain or a nuclear disin-
