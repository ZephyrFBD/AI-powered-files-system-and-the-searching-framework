Capacitor calculations. (a) Calculate the capacitance of a
parallel-plate capacitor whose plates are 
and are separated by a
1.0-mm air gap. (b) What is the charge on each plate if a 12-V battery is connected
across the two plates? (c) What is the electric field between the plates? (d) Esti-
mate the area of the plates needed to achieve a capacitance of 1 F, assuming the
air gap d is 100 times smaller, or 10 microns (1 micron
.
APPROACH The capacitance is found by using Eq. 17–8,
The
charge on each plate is obtained from the definition of capacitance, Eq. 17–7,
The electric field is uniform, so we can use Eq.17–4b for the magnitude
In (d) we use Eq. 17–8 again.
SOLUTION (a) The area 
.
The capacitance C is then
(b) The charge on each plate is
(c) From Eq. 17–4b for a uniform electric field, the magnitude of E is
(d) We solve for A in Eq. 17–8 and substitute
and 
to find that we need plates with an area
NOTE This is the area of a square 
or 1 km o
