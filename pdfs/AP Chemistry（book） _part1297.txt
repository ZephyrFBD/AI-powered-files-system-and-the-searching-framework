Sample Exercise 8.10
Resonance Structures
Which is predicted to have the shorter sulfur–oxygen bonds, SO3 or SO3
2 -?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of these statements about resonance is true?
(a)  
When you draw resonance structures, it is permissible  
to alter the way atoms are connected.
(b)  
The nitrate ion has one long N ¬ O bond and two short 
N ¬O bonds.
(c)  
“Resonance” refers to the idea that molecules are  
resonating rapidly between different bonding patterns.
(d)  
The cyanide ion has only one dominant resonance 
structure.
(e) All of the above are true.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Draw two equivalent resonance structures for the formate ion, 
HCO2
-.
SOLUTION
The sulfur atom has six valence electrons, as does oxygen. Thus, 
SO3 contains 24 valence electrons. In writing the Lewis structure, 
we see that three equivalent resonance structures can be drawn:
Our analysis of the Lewis structures thus far leads us to conclude 
that SO3 should have the shorter S ¬ O bonds and SO3
