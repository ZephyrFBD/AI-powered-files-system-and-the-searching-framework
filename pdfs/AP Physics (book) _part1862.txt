We already saw that water (Fig. 16–4) is a polar molecule, and we have encoun-
tered others in our discussion of molecular biology (Section 16–10). Table 17–2
gives the dipole moments for several molecules. The 
and 
signs indicate on
which atoms these charges lie. The last two entries are a part of many organic
molecules and play an important role in molecular biology.

‡ These last two groups often appear on
larger molecules; hence the value for the
dipole moment will vary somewhat,
depending on the rest of the molecule.
