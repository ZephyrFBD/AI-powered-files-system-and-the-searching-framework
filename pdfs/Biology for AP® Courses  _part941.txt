lity decrease and change with depth. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on
the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of the
sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation (Figure 8.14).

concentrations of their chlorophyll pigments. (credit: Jason Hollinger)
When studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption
spectra. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb.
Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption. By extracting pigments from leaves
and placing these samples into a spectrophotometer, scientists can identify which wavelengths of light an organism can
absorb. Additional methods for the identification of pla
