lves. Things on autosomes get inherited the same in males and females because they each have the
same number of autosomes.
Question 6
a. Describe how you can determine that tortoises raised at 34°C had the highest variability in enzyme reaction
rates.
Russian tortoises raised at 34°C had the largest error bars and therefore the largest variability.
b. Reptiles in the study needed to have a gertimtonase reaction rate exceeding 10 mmol/s for an observed
improvement in water retention. Describe the range of temperatures that Russian tortoises could be raised in to
achieve this benefit.
Russian tortoises could be raised between 37°C and 30°C for gertimtonase to have the water retention effect.
c. Desert tortoises live in environments where the ground temperature can exceed 60°C. Using the data above,
predict and justify how the graph would look for desert tortoise gertimtonase.
The graph’s peak would shift to the higher temperatures. Because the tortoise has lived in the desert for many
