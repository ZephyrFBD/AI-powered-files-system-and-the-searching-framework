 The rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod. Collaterals from the
visual pathways innervate the pineal gland. During the day photoperiod, little melatonin is produced; however, melatonin
production increases during the dark photoperiod (night). In some mammals, melatonin has an inhibitory affect on
reproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm, oocytes, and reproductive organs. Melatonin is
an effective antioxidant, protecting the CNS from free radicals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Lastly, melatonin
is involved in biological rhythms, particularly circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and eating habits.
Gonads
The gonads—the male testes and female ovaries—produce steroid hormones. The testes produce androgens, testosterone
being the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm
cells. The ovaries produce estradiol and progesterone, which cause secondary s
