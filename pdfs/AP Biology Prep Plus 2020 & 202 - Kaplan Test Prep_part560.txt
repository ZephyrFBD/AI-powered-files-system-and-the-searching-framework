5. The mRNA encoding the insulin polypeptide is translated on
ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).
Studies show that the protein encoded by the mRNA contains
almost twice as many amino acids as the active insulin. Insulin is
secreted into the bloodstream, along with an inactive peptide, at
a 1:1 molar ratio.
Which of the following best explains the observed results?
The precursor of insulin contains a signal sequence and an
internal region that are excised a»áer translation.
(A)
Insulin contains hydrophobic core residues that allow the
molecule to be embedded in the RER membrane.
(B)
Insulin is translated as a dimer and digested into monomers.
(C)
Insulin is degraded in the RER into amino acids that are later
reassembled prior to secretion.
(D)
6. A study shows that an isolated nucleic acid polymer contains 32%
adenine, 15% guanine, and 25% cytosine. Which of the following
conclusions is most probable based on this data?
The percentage of uracil
