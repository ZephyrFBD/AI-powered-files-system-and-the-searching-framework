s for the 100 °C sample but slightly less than 5 * 102 m>s for 
the 0 °C sample. Notice that the distribution curve broadens as we go to a higher tem-
perature, which tells us that the range of molecular speeds increases with temperature. 
The rms speed is important because the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules 
in a sample is equal to 1
2 m1urms22. 
 (Section 1.4) Because mass does not change with 
temperature, the increase in the average kinetic energy 1
2 m1urms22 as the temperature 
increases implies that the rms speed of the molecules (as well as uav and ump) increases as 
temperature increases.
Application of Kinetic-Molecular Theory to the Gas Laws
The empirical observations of gas properties as expressed by the various gas laws are read-
ily understood in terms of the kinetic-molecular theory. The following examples illus-
trate this point:
1. An increase in volume at constant temperature causes pressure to de-
crease. A constant temperature means that the average kin
