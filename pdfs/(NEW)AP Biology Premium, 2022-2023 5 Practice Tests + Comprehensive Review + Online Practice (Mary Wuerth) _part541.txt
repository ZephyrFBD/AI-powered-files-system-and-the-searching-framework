rate of smaller organisms may require that these small organisms consume more food per
gram of body weight, so choice (D) is incorrect.
7. (D) Producers transfer energy to other trophic levels and do not receive energy from any trophic level. IV is the
only member of this food web that sends energy to other members but does not receive energy from other
members of the food web.
8. (A) Primary consumers get energy from producers, and secondary consumers get energy from primary
consumers (herbivores). In this food web, IV is a producer, I and III are both primary consumers, and I, II, and
V are secondary consumers. Choice (A) is the only member of this food web that is both a primary and
secondary consumer.
9. (A) Ectothermic animals have a higher metabolism at higher environmental temperatures. Since species X’s
consumption of oxygen is greater at 30°C than at 5°C, it is most likely ectothermic. Choice (B) correctly states
that species X is ectothermic but gives incorrect reasoning; ect
