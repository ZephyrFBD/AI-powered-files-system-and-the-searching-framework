(2–11a through 2–11c) separately for the vertical and
horizontal components of the motion. These equations are shown separately for
the x and y components of the motion in Table 3–1, for the general case of two-
dimensional motion at constant acceleration. Note that x and y are the respective
displacements, that 
and 
are the components of the velocity, and that 
and 
are the components of the acceleration, each of which is constant.

We can simplify Eqs.2–11 to use for projectile motion because we can set
See Table 3–2, which assumes y is positive upward, so

If the projection angle 
is chosen relative to the

In doing Problems involving projectile motion, we must consider a time interval for
which our chosen object is in the air, influenced only by gravity. We do not consider
the throwing (or projecting) process, nor the time after the object lands or is caught,
because then other in
