 24.80  Which statement best explains the chemical differences 
between DNA and RNA? (a) DNA has two different sugars 
in its sugar–phosphate backbone, but RNA only has one. 
(b) Thymine is one of the DNA bases, whereas RNA’s cor-
responding base is thymine minus a methyl group. (c) The 
RNA sugar–phosphate backbone contains fewer oxygen 
atoms than DNA’s backbone. (d) DNA forms double helices 
but RNA cannot.
