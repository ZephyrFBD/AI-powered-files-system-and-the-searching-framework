 grating, or sometimes a prism. A prism works because of dispersion
(Section 24–4), bending light of different wavelengths into different angles. A prism
is not a linear device and must be calibrated because is not
; see Fig.24–14.
An important use of a spectrometer is for the identification of atoms or 
molecules. When a gas is heated or an electric current is passed through it, the gas
emits a characteristic line spectrum. That is, only certain discrete wavelengths of
light are emitted, and these are different for different elements and compounds.†
Figure 24–28 shows the line spectra for a number of elements in the gas state.
Line spectra occur only for gases at high temperatures and low pressure and 
density. The light from heated solids, such as a lightbulb filament, and even from
a dense gaseous object such as the Sun, produces a continuous spectrum including
a wide range of wavelengths.
Figure 24–28 also shows the Sun’s “continuous spectrum,”which contains a num-
ber of dark line
