battery is to produce a potential difference, which can then
make charges move. When a continuous conducting path is connected between
the terminals of a battery, we have an electric circuit, Fig. 18–6a. On any diagram
of a circuit, as in Fig. 18–6b, we use the symbol 
or
[battery symbol]
to represent a battery. The device connected to the battery could be a lightbulb,
a heater, a radio, or some other device. When such a circuit is formed, charge can
move (or flow) through the wires of the circuit, from one terminal of the battery
to the other, as long as the conducting path is continuous. Any flow of charge
such as this is called an electric current.
More precisely, the electric current in a wire is defined as the net amount of
charge that passes through the wire’s full cross section at any point per unit time.
Thus, the current I is defined as

where 
is the amount of charge that passes through the conductor at any loca-
tion during the time interval
