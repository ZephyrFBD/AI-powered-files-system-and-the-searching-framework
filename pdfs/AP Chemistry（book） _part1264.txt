(a) The charge on each atom is the electronic charge, 
e = 1.60 * 10-19 C. The separation is 1.27 Å. The 
dipole moment is therefore:
Thus, the experimental dipole moment indicates 
that the charge separation in the HCl molecule is:

(b) We know the value of m, 1.08 D, and the value of 
r, 1.27 Å. We want to calculate the value of Q:

Table 8.2 presents the bond lengths and dipole moments of the hydrogen halides. 
Notice that as we proceed from HF to HI, the electronegativity difference decreases 
and the bond length increases. The first effect decreases the amount of charge sepa-
rated and causes the dipole moment to decrease fro
