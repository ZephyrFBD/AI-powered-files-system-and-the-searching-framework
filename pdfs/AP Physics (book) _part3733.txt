A basic assumption in cosmology has been that on a large scale, the universe
would look the same to observers at different places at the same time. In other
words, the universe is both isotropic (looks the same in all directions) and
homogeneous (would look the same if we were located elsewhere, say in another
galaxy). This assumption is called the cosmological principle. On a local scale,
say in our solar system or within our Galaxy, it clearly does not apply (the sky
looks different in different directions). But it has long been thought to be valid 
if we look on a large enough scale, so that the average population density of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies ought to be the same in different areas of the sky.
This seems to be valid on distances greater than about 700 Mly. The expansion of
the universe (Fig. 33–22) is consistent with the cosmological principle; and the
near uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation (discussed in
Section 33–6) suppor
