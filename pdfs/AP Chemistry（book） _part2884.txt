Sulfur dioxide is harmful to both human health and property; furthermore, atmo-
spheric SO2 can be oxidized to SO3 by several pathways (such as reaction with O2 or O3). 
When SO3 dissolves in water, it produces sulfuric acid:
 
SO31g2 + H2O1l2 ยก H2SO41aq2 
Many of the environmental effects ascribed to SO2 are actually due to H2SO4.
The presence of SO2 in the atmosphere and the sulfuric acid it produces result in 
the phenomenon of acid rain. (Nitrogen oxides, which form nitric acid, are also major 
contributors to acid rain.) Uncontaminated rainwater generally has a pH value of about 
5.6. The primary source of this natural acidity is CO2, which reacts with water to form 
carbonic acid, H2CO3. Acid rain typically has a pH value of about 4. This shift toward 
greater acidity has affected many lakes in northern Europe, the northern United States, 
and Canada, reducing fish populations and affecting other parts of the ecological net-
work in the lakes and surrounding forests.
