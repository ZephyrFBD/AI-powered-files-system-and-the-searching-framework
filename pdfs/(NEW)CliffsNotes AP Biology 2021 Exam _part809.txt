al variable.
Prepare one additional potometer for normal conditions, a control to which the transpiration rate for the applied
environmental condition can be compared.
3. Collect data. Record the change in water level in the pipette over several intervals of time. If you are using gas
pressure sensors, the associated computer software will generate a transpiration rate. If you are using an entire plant,
weigh the plant at various intervals over a period of several days while maintaining constant environmental
conditions. After recording this data, you will need to remove the leaves to determine their total surface area because
the number of leaves and the sizes of leaves will influence the amount of transpiration.
4. Calculate transpiration rate. Calculate water loss per surface area per
 
time (e.g., ml/cm2/min) by dividing water loss by the total surface area
 
and by the time recorded for the intervals. If using gas pressure sensors, divide the computer generated transpiration
rate
