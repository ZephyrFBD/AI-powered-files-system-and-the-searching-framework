ster ochraceus, of the northwestern United States is a keystone
species (Figure 36.31). Studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, populations of their
natural prey (mussels) increase, completely altering the species composition and reducing biodiversity. Another keystone
species is the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic
nutrient, to the rest of the community. If these fish were to become extinct, the community would be greatly affected.

Invasive Species
Invasive species are non-native organisms that, when introduced to an area out of their native range,
threaten the ecosystem balance of that habitat. Many such spe
