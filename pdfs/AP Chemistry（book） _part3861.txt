al. A carbon atom with four different attached groups is called a 
chiral center. For example, consider 2-bromopentane:
CH3
CH2CH2CH3
C
H
Br
All four groups attached to the second carbon are different, making that carbon a chi-
ral center. Figure 24.14 illustrates the nonsuperimposable mirror images of this molecule. 
Imagine moving the molecule shown to the left of the mirror over to the right of the mir-
ror. If you then turn it in every possible way, you will conclude that it cannot be super-
imposed on the molecule shown to the right of the mirror. Nonsuperimposable mirror 
images are called either optical isomers or enantiomers. 
 (Section 23.4) Organic chem-
ists use the labels R and S to distinguish the two forms. We will not go into the rules for 
deciding on the labels.

The two members of an enantiomer pair have identical physical properties and iden-
tical chemical properties when they react with nonchir
