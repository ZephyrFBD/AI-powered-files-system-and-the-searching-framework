ion proteins attach cells to neighboring cells or provide anchors for the internal filaments and tubules that
give stability to the cell.
3. Cholesterol molecules distributed throughout the phospholipid bilayer provide some stability to the plasma
membranes of animal cells. At higher temperatures, cholesterol helps maintain firmness, but at lower temperatures,
it helps keep the membrane flexible.
Organelles are bodies within the cytoplasm that serve to physically separate the various metabolic reactions that
occur within eukaryotic cells. Within these bodies, chemical reactions are isolated and can take place without
interference or competition with other reactions that might be occurring nearby. Many of these bodies also provide
large surface areas to maximize the space over which these chemical reactions can take place. Also, cells can be
specialized for specific functions depending on the kinds and number of organelles in that cell. Descriptions of the
important organelles as well a
