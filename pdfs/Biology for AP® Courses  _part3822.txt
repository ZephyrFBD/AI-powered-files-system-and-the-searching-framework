. Flame cells are found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. They
also maintain the organismâ€™s osmotic balance.
Figure 32.11 In the excretory system of the (a) planaria, cilia of flame cells propel waste through a tubule formed
by a tube cell. Tubules are connected into branched structures that lead to pores located all along the sides of the
body. The filtrate is secreted through these pores. In (b) annelids such as earthworms, nephridia filter fluid from the
coelom, or body cavity. Beating cilia at the opening of the nephridium draw water from the coelom into a tubule. As
the filtrate passes down the tubules, nutrients and other solutes are reabsorbed by capillaries. Filtered fluid containing
nitrogenous and other wastes is stored in a bladder and then secreted through a pore in the side of the body.
Earthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia, illustrated in Figure 32.11b. A
pair of nephridia is present on e
