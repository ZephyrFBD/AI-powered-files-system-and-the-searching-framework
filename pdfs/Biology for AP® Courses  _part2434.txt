than it does today and was subjected to strong radiation; thus, the first organisms would have flourished where
they were more protected, such as in ocean depths or beneath the surface of the Earth. At this time too, strong volcanic
activity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms—the first prokaryotes—were adapted to very high
temperatures. Early Earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by
mutagenic radiation from the sun. The first organisms were prokaryotes that could withstand these harsh conditions.
Microbial Mats
Microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth; there is fossil evidence of their presence
starting about 3.5 billion years ago. A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 22.2) that includes
mostly bacteria, but also archaea. Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow where different types
