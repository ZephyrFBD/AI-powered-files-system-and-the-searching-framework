 cup that holds 500 mL of 
hot water, initially at 83 °C. What is the final temperature 
in the cup? The density of liquid water is 1.00 g>mL; the 
specific heat capacity of ice is 2.03 J>g@C; the specific heat 
capacity of liquid water is 4.184 J>g@C; the enthalpy of 
fusion of water is 6.01 kJ>mol.
 19.108  Carbon disulfide 1CS22 is a toxic, highly flammable sub-
stance. The following thermodynamic data are available 
for CS21l2 and CS21g2 at 298 K:

 (a) Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule. What do you 
predict for the bond order of the C ¬ S bonds? (b) Use the 
VSEPR method to predict the structure of the CS2 mole-
cule. (c) Liquid CS2 burns in O2 with a blue flame, forming 
CO21g2 and SO21g2. Write a balanced equation for this reac-
tion. (d) Using the data in the preceding table and in Appen-
dix C, calculate ∆H° and ∆G° for the reaction in part (c). 
 
Is the reaction exothermic? Is it spontaneous at 298 K?
