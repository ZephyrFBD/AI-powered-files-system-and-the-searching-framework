n also must be done in a special way. All
these relativistic effects are significant only at high speeds,
close to the speed of light, which itself is the ultimate speed in
the universe.

CHAPTER 26
The Special Theory of Relativity
15. An electron is limited to travel at speeds less than c. Does
this put an upper limit on the momentum of an electron?
If so, what is this upper limit? If not, explain.
16. Can a particle of nonzero mass attain the speed of light?
Explain.
17. Does the equation 
conflict with the conservation
of energy principle? Explain.
18. If mass is a form of energy, does this mean that a spring has
more mass when compressed than when relaxed? Explain.
19. It is not correct to say that “matter can neither be created
nor destroyed.” What must we say instead?
20. Is our intuitive notion that velocities simply add, as in
Section 3–8, comple
