at each resonant
frequency is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency on a vibrating string.
Because a standing wave is equivalent to two traveling waves moving in
opposite directions, the concept of wave velocity still makes sense and is given by
Eq. 11–13 in terms of the tension 
in the string and its mass per unit length
That is,
for waves traveling in either direction.

CHAPTER 11
†The term “harmonic” comes from music, because such integral multiples of frequencies “harmonize.”
Piano string. A piano string 1.10 m long has mass 9.00 g.
(a) How much tension must the string be under if it is to vibrate at a fundamental
frequency of 131 Hz? (b) What are the frequencies of the first four harmonics?
