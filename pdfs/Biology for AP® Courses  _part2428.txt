In the recent past, scientists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms based on several criteria, including the absence
or presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, the absence or presence of cell walls, multicellularity, and
so on. As we learned earlier, prokaryotes were the first cells to evolve on Earth 3.5 to 4.5 millions of years ago and lacked
a nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles. In the late 20th century, scientists compared sequences of small-subunit ribosomal
RNA, which resulted in a more fundamental way to group organisms on Earth. Based on the differences in the structure of
the cell membranes and in rRNA, Carl Woese and his colleagues proposed the three domain system. The domain Bacteria
comprises all organisms in the kingdom Eubacteria (bacteria),
