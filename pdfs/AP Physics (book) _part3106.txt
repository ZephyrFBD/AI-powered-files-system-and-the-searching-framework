electrons that are produced as photoelectrons?
86. Photons of energy 6.0 eV are incident on a metal. It is
found that current flows from the metal until a stopping
potential of 3.8 V is applied. If the wavelength of the
incident photons is doubled, what is the maximum kinetic
energy of the ejected electrons? What would happen if the
wavelength of the incident photons was tripled?
87. What would be the theoretical limit of resolution for an
electron microscope whose electrons are accelerated
through 110 kV? (Relativistic formulas should be used.)
88. Assume hydrogen atoms in a gas are initially in their
ground state. If free electrons with kinetic energy 12.75 eV
collide with these atoms, what photon wavelengths will be
emitted by the gas?
89. Visible light incident on a diffraction grating with slit
spacing of 0.010 mm has the first maximum at an angle of
3.6Â° from the central peak. If electrons could be diffracted
by the same grating, what electron velocity would produce
the same diff
