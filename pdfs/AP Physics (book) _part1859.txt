
(a) Set (iii) has a positive potential energy because the charges have the same
sign. (b) Both (i) and (ii) have opposite signs of charge and negative 
.
Because r is smaller in (i), the 
is most negative for (i). (c) Set (i) will require
the most work for separation to infinity. The more negative the potential
energy, the more work required to separate the charges and bring the 
up to
zero 
as in Fig. 17–9b.
