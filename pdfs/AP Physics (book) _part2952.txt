If you are given a particle’s mass m and its kinetic energy ke, you can do a
quick calculation to determine if you need to use relativistic formulas or if classical
ones are good enough. You simply compute the ratio 
because (Eq. 26–5b)
If this ratio comes out to be less than, say, 0.01, then
and relativistic
equations will correct the classical ones by about 1%. If your expected precision
is no better than 1%, classical formulas are good enough. But if your precision is
1 part in 1000 (0.1%) then you would want to use relativistic formulas. If your
expected precision is only 10%, you need relativity if

need to be treated
relativistically? [Hint: The mass of an electron is 0.511 MeV.]
