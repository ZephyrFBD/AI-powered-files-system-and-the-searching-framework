in Rome produced many previously unknown isotopes by
bombarding different elements with neutrons. Fermi realized that if the heaviest
known element, uranium, is bombarded with neutrons, it might be possible to
produce new elements with atomic numbers greater than that of uranium. After
several years of hard work, it was suspected that two new elements had been
produced, neptunium 
and plutonium 
The full confirmation
that such “transuranic” elements could be produced came several years later at
the University of California, Berkeley. The reactions are shown in Fig. 31–1.
It was soon shown that what Fermi had actually observed when he bom-
barded uranium was an even stranger process—one that was destined to play an
extraordinary role in the world at large. We discuss it in Section 31–2.
Cross Section
Some reactions have a higher probability of occurring than others. The reaction
probability is specified by a quantity called the collision cross section. Although
the size of a nucleus, li
