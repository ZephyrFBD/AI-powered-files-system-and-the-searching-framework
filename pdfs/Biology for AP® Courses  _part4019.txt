bring about this disease?
a.
The body produces antibodies against nerve
cells, which prevents the nerve cells from
releasing acetylcholine during signal
transmissions to muscle.
b.
The body produces antibodies against
acetylcholine, which prevents acetylcholine
from transmitting signals from nerves to muscle.
c.
The body produces antibodies against receptors
in muscle, which prevents acetylcholine from
binding and completing nerve signal
transmission.
d.
The body produces antibodies against
acetylcholine, which prevents acetylcholine
from breaking down after signal transmission is
complete.
