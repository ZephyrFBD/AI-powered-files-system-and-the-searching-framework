 end that will not interact with
water. (The fatty acid is completely hydrophilic.) Therefore,
phospholipids can form bilayers in water while fatty acids
cannot.
(C)
Translation of mRNA by ribosomes produces fatty acids. The
sequence of carbon atoms incorporated in the polymer chain
determines whether or not the fatty acid will be able to form a
bilayer.
(D)
7. One hypothesis for an evolutionary pathway that would lead to
modern membranes includes a step in which early membranes
were composed of fatty acids. Which of the following best
explains why fatty acids are a good candidate for a component of
early membranes?
Since fatty acids are capable of catalyzing reactions and are
simpler than protein-based enzymes, they are likely to have
evolved first.
(A)
Phospholipids likely evolved into fatty acids because the
complex structure of the phospholipid was unnecessary.
(B)
