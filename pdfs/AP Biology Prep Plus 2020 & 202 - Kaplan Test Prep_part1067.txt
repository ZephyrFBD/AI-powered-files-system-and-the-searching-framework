Description (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Protein structure and function depend upon the tertiary structure of a protein, which is
formed from the interactions between the R groups of amino acids. Changing the amino acid
sequence of a protein may affect the interactions between the R groups, and thereby affect
the overall protein structure and function.
(b)Â Based on the figure, identify the polarity of the solvent that the protein molecules
were exposed to. (1 point)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The figure shows that the fraction of hydrophobic amino acids buried is greater than the
fraction of hydrophilic amino acids buried. A protein in an aqueous environment will fold so
that the hydrophilic R groups are at the surface and the hydrophobic R groups are on the
inside of the protein. Thus, the solvent that the prote
