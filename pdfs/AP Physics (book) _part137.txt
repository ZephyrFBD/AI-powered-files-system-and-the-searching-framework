ng back (west) a
distance of 30 m (see Fig. 2–4). The total distance traveled is 100 m, but the
displacement is only 40 m since the person is now only 40 m from the starting point.
Displacement is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Such
quantities are called vectors, and are represented by arrows in diagrams. For
example, in Fig. 2–4, the blue arrow represents the displacement whose magni-
tude is 40 m and whose direction is to the right (east).
We will deal with vectors more fully in Chapter 3. For now, we deal only with
motion in one dimension, along a line. In this case, vectors which point in one direc-
tion will be positive (typically to the right along the x axis). Vectors that point
in the opposite direction will have a negative sign in front of their magnitude.
Consider the motion of an object over a particular time interval. Suppose that
at some initial time, call it 
the object is on the x axis at the position 
in the
coordinate system shown in Fig. 2–5. At som
