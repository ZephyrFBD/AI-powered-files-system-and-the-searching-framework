then nickel, then silver. 
(b) The platinum cube is smallest, then gold, then lead. 1.9 (a) 7.5 cm; 
 
two signiﬁcant ﬁgures (sig ﬁgs) (b) 72 mi  >  hr (inner scale, two sig-
niﬁcant ﬁgures) or 115 km  >  hr (outer scale, three signiﬁcant ﬁgures)  
1.11 464 jelly beans. The mass of an average bean has 2 decimal plac-
es and 3 sig ﬁgs. The number of beans then has 3 sig ﬁgs, by the rules 
for multiplication and division. 1.13 (a) Heterogeneous mixture 
(b) homogeneous mixture (heterogeneous if there are undissolved 
particles) (c) pure substance (d) pure substance. 1.15 (a) S (b) Au 
(c) K (d) Cl (e) Cu (f) uranium (g) nickel (h) sodium (i) aluminum 
(j) silicon 1.17 C is a compound; it contains both carbon and oxy-
gen. A is a compound; it contains at least carbon and oxygen. B is not 
deﬁned by the data given; it is probably also a compound because few 
elements exist as white solids. 1.19 Physical properties: silvery white; 
lustrous; melting point = 649 °C, boiling point = 1105 °C;
