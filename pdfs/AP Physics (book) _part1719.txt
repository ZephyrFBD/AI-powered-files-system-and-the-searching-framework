 attracts the opposite type. That is: unlike charges attract; like charges repel.
The two types of electric charge were referred to as positive and negative by
the American statesman, philosopher, and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790).
The choice of which name went with which type of charge was arbitrary. Franklin’s
choice set the charge on the rubbed glass rod to be positive charge, so the charge
on a rubbed plastic ruler (or amber) is called negative charge. We still follow this
convention today.
Franklin argued that whenever a certain amount of charge is produced on one
object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced on another
object. The positive and negative are to be treated algebraically, so during any
process, the net change in the amount of charge produced is zero. For example,
when a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel, the plastic acquires a negative
charge and the towel acquires an equal amount of positive charge. The charges
are separated,
