ence of arabinose. 
  If a gene that encodes a green fluorescent protein (GFP) is substituted for the structural genes of the operon, 
activation of the regulatory sequences can be assayed by GFP expression. A culture of E. coli cells underwent a 
transformation procedure with a plasmid containing the regulatory sequences of the ara operon directly upstream 
of the gene encoding the GFP. The plasmid also confers ampicillin resistance to bacteria. Samples were then 
plated on different types of culture media. (Note: The GFP fluoresces only under UV light, not under white 
light.) The table below shows the results.
