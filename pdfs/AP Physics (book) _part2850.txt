percent): that is, 4 represents twice 
as much absorption as 2. But we cannot directly measure these values—they are
the unknowns we want to solve for. All we can measure are the projections—the
total absorption along each beam line—and these are shown in Fig. 25–45 out-
side the yellow squares as the sum of the absorptions for the pixels along each
line at four different angles. These projections (given at the tip of each arrow) are
what we can measure, and we now want to work back from them to see how close
we can get to the true absorption value for each pixel. We start our analysis with
each pixel being assigned a zero value, Fig. 25–46a. In the iterative technique, we
use the projections to estimate the absorption value in each square, and repeat
for each angle. The angle 1 projections are 7 and 13 (Fig. 25–45). We divide each of
these equally between their two squares: each square in the left column of Fig.25–46a
gets 
(half of 7), and each square in the right column gets 
(half
