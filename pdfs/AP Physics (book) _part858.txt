8–9 Vector Nature of 
Angular Quantities
Up to now we have considered only the magnitudes of angular quantities such 
as 
and L. But they have a vector aspect too, and now we consider the 
directions. In fact, we have to define the directions for rotational quantities. We
consider first the angular velocity,
Consider the rotating wheel shown in Fig. 8–30a. The linear velocities of 
different particles of the wheel point in all different directions. The only unique
direction in space associated with the rotation is along the axis of rotation, perpen-
dicular to the actual motion. We therefore choose the axis of rotation to be the
direction of the angular velocity vector,
Actually, there is s
