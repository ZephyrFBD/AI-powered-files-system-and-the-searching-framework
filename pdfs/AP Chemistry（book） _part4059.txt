orces, (d) temperature and (e) density of the liquid affect vapor 
pressure of a liquid. 
11.51 (a) CBr4 6 CHBr3 6 CH2Br2 6 CH2Cl2 6 CH3Cl 6 CH4.
(b) CH4 6 CH3Cl 6 CH2Cl2 6 CH2Br2 6 CHBr3 6 CBr4 (c) By anal-
ogy to attractive forces in HCl, the trend will be dominated by disper-
sion forces, even though four of the molecules are polar. The order 
of increasing boiling point is the order of increasing molar mass and 
increasing strength of dispersion forces. 11.53 (a) The temperature 
of the water in the two pans is the same. (b) Vapor pressure does not 
depend on either volume or surface area of the liquid. At the same 
temperature, the vapor pressures of water in the two containers are
