27. Name one natural and one human-related type of
disturbance. Why are they of concern to conservationists?
a.
Lightening is a type of natural disturbance
whereas pollution is a human related
disturbance. Both are of concern to
conservationists because they affect the entire
ecosystem.
b.

agriculture is a human related disturbance. Both
types are of concern to conservationists because
ecosystems cannot bounce back from a
disturbance.
c.
Pollution is a type of natural disturbance
whereas lightening is a human related
disturbance. Both are of concern to
conservationists because they alter ecosystems.
d.
Lightening is a type of natural disturbance
