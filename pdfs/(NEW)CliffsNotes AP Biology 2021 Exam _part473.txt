ed (within the same family) or some of which may be distantly related (in
different families or even different orders), it contains organisms at least some of which may be very distantly
related. However, there must be some general characteristic shared by all organisms in a class that allows them to be
grouped at the class level.
2. A. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use the same four nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) to
construct DNA. In contrast, the flagella of prokaryotes are made of the globular protein flagellin, whereas those of
eukaryotes are made of the protein tubulin (in microtubules arranged in a “9 + 2” pattern). A prokaryotic
chromosome consists of a circular DNA molecule; chromosomes of eukaryotes are linear.
The cell division of eukaryotes consists of mitosis (or meiosis), which divides the chromosomes and the nucleus,
followed by cytokinesis. Since they have no nucleus, cell division in prokaryotes is by binary fission (chromosome
replication follo
