 be the last formal course in chemistry 
that you will take. Regardless of the career path you plan to take—
whether it is chemistry, one of the biomedical fields, engineering, 
the liberal arts, or another field—we hope that this text has increased 
your appreciation of the chemistry in the world around you. As you 
will observe, chemistry is everywhere, from food and pharmaceuti-
cals to solar cells and sports equipment.
We have also tried to give you a sense that chemistry is a 
dynamic, continuously changing science. Research chemists 
synthesize new compounds, develop new reactions, uncover 
chemical properties that were previously unknown, find new 
applications for known compounds, and refine theories. The 
understanding of biological systems in terms of the underlying 
chemistry has become increasingly important as new levels of 
complexity are uncovered. Solving the global challenges of sus-
tainable energy and clean water requires the work of many chem-
ists. We encourage you
