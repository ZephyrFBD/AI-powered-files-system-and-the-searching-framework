ction of the ratio between rate and substrate
concentration (v/[S]). The y-intercept is Vmax (the maximum rate of
reaction) and the absolute value of the slope is Km (the aﬀinity for
substrate by an active enzyme). A high Km indicates low substrate
aﬀinity. The figure below shows a plot of competitive,
noncompetitive, and no inhibition.
Competitive inhibition prevents the substrate from binding the
enzyme, whereas noncompetitive inhibition inactivates the
enzyme. Based on the figure, which of the following correctly
describes the characteristics of enzyme inhibition?
Noncompetitive inhibition reduces Vmax and the amount of
substrate needed to reach half Vmax.
(A)
Competitive inhibition increases Km, so more substrate is
needed to reach Vmax.
(B)
Noncompetitive inhibition has a lower Vmax and a higher Km
than competitive inhibition.
(C)
In competitive inhibition, a small amount of substrate is
needed to saturate the enzyme.
(D)
