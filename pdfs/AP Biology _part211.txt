substrate level phosphorylation, which is carried out with the help
of an allosteric kinase, phosphofructokinase.
The citric acid cycle utilizes the pyruvate from glycolysis to
produce ATP by substrate level phosphorylation. It releases a
small amount of ATP and the waste product CO2. The important
products are NADH and FADH2, which carry protons and
electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) in the cristae
membrane where oxidative phosphorylation occurs.
Oxidative phosphorylation includes the ETC and chemiosmosis.
The ETC pumps protons and electrons through the cristae
membrane against a gradient through a series of REDOX reactions
to create a proton gradient.
Chemiosmosis is the process by which a proton gradient powers
the production of ATP as protons flow down the gradient through
the ATP synthase channel.
Oxidative phosphorylation, more specifically the ETC, couples two
reactions within the cristae membraneâ€”an exergonic one
(electrons are strongly pulled toward oxygen)
