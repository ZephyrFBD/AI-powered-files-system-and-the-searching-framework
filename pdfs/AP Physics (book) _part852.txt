ith those for energy and linear momentum.
When there is zero net torque acting on an object, and the object is rotating
about a fixed axis or about an axis through its center of mass whose direction
doesn’t change, we can write
(8;20)
and 
are the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively, about that
axis at some initial time 
and I and 
are their values at some other time.
The parts of the object may alter their positions relative to one another, so that I
changes. But then 
changes as well, so that the product 
remains constant.
