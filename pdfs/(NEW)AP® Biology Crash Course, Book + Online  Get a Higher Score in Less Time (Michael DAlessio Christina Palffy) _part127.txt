 this situation applied more generally to all species and further proposed that
the availability of limited resources led to competition between members of a species.
B. Natural Selection
1. By studying 12 different types of finches on the Galapagos Islands, Darwin made a link between the
origin of a new species and the environment in which these species reside.
2. Theory of Natural Selection—reproductive success of an organism depends on its ability to adapt to
the environment in which it resides. For example, several of the finches in the Galapagos Islands
adapted their beak structure to find food.
3. Postulates of Natural Selection—
i.
Every population has variation in phenotypes due to genetic mutations.
ii. If the environment cannot support the individuals who occupy it, then competition occurs between
members of a species and affects the production of offspring. If an aspect of the environment
causes some organisms to survive over others, it is said to exert selective pressure.
