As expected from Grahamâ€™s law, helium escapes from containers through tiny pinhole 
leaks more rapidly than other gases of higher molecular weight (Figure 10.15).
Diffusion and Mean Free Path
Although diffusion, like effusion, is faster for lower-mass molecules than for higher-mass 
ones, molecular collisions make diffusion more complicated than effusion.
Grahamâ€™s law, Equation 10.22, approximates the ratio of the diffusion rates of two 
gases under identical conditions. We can see from the horizontal axis in Figure 10.13 that 
the speeds of molecules are quite high. For example, the rms speed of molecules of N2 
gas at room temperature is 515 m/s. In spite of this high speed, if someone opens a vial 
of perfume at one end of a room, some time elapsesâ€”perhaps a few minutesâ€”before the 
scent is detected at the other end of the room. This tells us that the diffusion rate of gases
