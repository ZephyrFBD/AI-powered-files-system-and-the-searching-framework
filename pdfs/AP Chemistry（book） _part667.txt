nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. UF6 is made from the 
reaction of elemental uranium with ClF3, which also pro-
duces Cl2 as a by-product.
 
 (a)  
Write the balanced molecular equation for the conver-
sion of U and ClF3 into UF6 and Cl2.
 
 (b)  
Is this a metathesis reaction?
 
 (c)  
Is this a redox reaction?
 4.92 The accompanying photo shows the reaction between a 
solution of Cd1NO322 and one of Na2S. (a) What is the iden-
tity of the precipitate? (b) What ions remain in solution? 
 
(c) Write the net ionic equation for the reaction. (d) Is this a 
redox reaction?
 4.93 Suppose you have a solution that might contain any or all 
of the following cations: Ni2+, Ag+, Sr2+, and Mn2+. Addition 
of HCl solution causes a precipitate to form. After filtering 
off the precipitate, H2SO4 solution is added to the resulting 
solution and another precipitate forms. This is filtered off, 
and a solution of NaOH is added to the resulting solution. 
No precipitate is observed. Which ions ar
