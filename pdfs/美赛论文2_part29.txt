3.5.2.4 The Foundation of Model 
The treatment center would estimate the different demand for drugs of 14 cities, 
then, make the distribution of drugs. Considering that there is certain error between 
the prediction and the actual situation, there would be a case that drugs are sufficient 
for an epidemic area, but not sufficient for the other. The distance of the two cities is 
much shorter than the distance from the treatment center to the two cities. In this case,

medication transport between the two cities (lateral transport) is much more 
reasonable, which saves time and cost. Thus, it is necessary to combine the drug 
distribution from the treatment center to epidemic areas with drug transport between 
epidemic areas. Such distribution plan can improve the efficiency.2 
So we build a model based on both the vertical and lateral tra
