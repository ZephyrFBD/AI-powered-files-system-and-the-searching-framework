on average, nearly
constant. To calculate the force due to all the molecules in the container, we have
to add the contributions of each. If all N molecules have the same mass m, the net
force on the wall is
where 
means 
for molecule number 1 (we arbitrarily assign each molecule 
a number) and the sum extends over the total number of molecules N in the 
container. The average value of the square of the x component of velocity is
(13;5)
where the overbar 
means “average.” Thus we can write the force as

We know that the square of any vector is equal to the sum of the squares of its
components (theorem of Pythagoras). Thus
