lood into the pulmonary artery, through the pulmonary semilunar valve, and toward the
lungs. When the ventricles contract, the AV valve closes and prevents blood moving backward into the atrium.
When the ventricles relax, the semilunar valve prevents backflow from the pulmonary artery back into the
ventricles.
3. Left atrium. After the lungs, the oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.
4. Left ventricle. Passing through the left AV valve (also called the mitral or bicuspid valve), the blood moves into
the left ventricle. From here, the muscular left ventricle pumps the blood into the largest artery, the aorta, through
the aortic semilunar valve, and throughout the body. Similar to the valves on the right side of the heart, the left AV
valve prevents movement of blood into the atrium, and the semilunar valve prevents backflow into the ventricle.
The blood pathway between the right side of the heart, to the lungs, and back to the left side of the heart is
