Given their definitions, frequency and
period are inversely related, as we saw earlier (Eqs. 5–2 and 8–8):

For example, if the frequency is 2 cycles per second, then each cycle takes
EXERCISE B If an oscillating mass has a frequency of 1.25 Hz, it makes 100 oscillations
in (a) 12.5 s, (b) 125 s, (c) 80 s, (d) 8.0 s.
The oscillation of a spring hung vertically is similar to that of a horizontal spring;
but because of gravity, the length of a vertical spring with a mass m on the end will
be longer at equilibrium than when that same spring is horizontal. See Fig. 11–3.
The spring is in equilibrium when
so the spring stretches
an extra amount
to be in equilibrium. If x is measured from this new
equilibrium position, Eq. 11–1 can be used directly with the same value of k.
