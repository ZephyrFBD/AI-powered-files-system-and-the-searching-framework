 feed on these zooplankton. Runoff from herbicides can pollute the waters,
reducing the number of phytoplankton. This can lead to a reduction in the zooplankton population size and the
animals that depend on the zooplankton for food, thereby reducing the biodiversity of the ecosystem. This is an
example of bottom-up regulation.
Animals at higher trophic levels may help limit the population sizes at lower levels. If these top predators are
removed from an ecosystem, the population sizes of other trophic levels may exceed the producersâ€™ ability to
produce enough food to support them, and the food web may collapse. This is called top-down regulation. An
example of top-down regulation can be seen in the rain forests of Venezuela. Manmade construction of dams created
isolated islands of rain forests, some of which contained top predators like crocodiles, while others were left without
top predators. After a few years, the biodiversity of the sections of rain forests without top predators wa
