Somatosensory Receptors
Sensory receptors are classified into five categories: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, proprioceptors, pain receptors,
and chemoreceptors. These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces. What is commonly
referred to as “touch” involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor. Mechanoreceptors in
the skin are described as encapsulated (that is, surrounded by a capsule) or unencapsulated (a group that includes free nerve
endings). A free nerve ending, as its name implies, is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron. Free nerve endings
are the most common nerve endings in skin, and they extend into the middle of the epidermis. Free nerve endings are
sensitive to painful stimuli, to hot and cold, and to light touch. They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive
to abrupt changes in stimulation.
There are three classes of mechanoreceptors:
