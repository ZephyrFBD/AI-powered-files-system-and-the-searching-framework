ENE-1.B: Explain the effect 
of surface area-to-volume 
ratios on the exchange of 
materials between cells 
or organisms and the 
environment.
Cell Size
(A) 
Correct. Diffusion happens very quickly in cells that have a high 
surface area-to-volume ratio. The data in the table show that the simple 
squamous cell has the highest ratio.
(B) 
Incorrect. Diffusion happens very quickly in cells that have a high 
surface area-to-volume ratio. The data in the table show that the simple 
cuboidal cell does not have the highest ratio.
(C) 
Incorrect. Diffusion happens very quickly in cells that have a high 
surface area-to-volume ratio. The data in the table show that the simple 
columnar cell does not have the highest ratio.
(D) 
Incorrect. Diffusion happens very quickly in cells that have a high 
surface area-to-volume ratio. The data in the table show that the simple 
spherical cell does not have
