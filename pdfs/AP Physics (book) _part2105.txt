 This may not happen when fibrillation occurs because, once
started, it can be hard to stop. Fibrillation may also occur as a result of a heart attack or during heart
surgery. A device known as a defibrillator (described in Section 17–9) can apply a brief high current to
the heart, causing complete heart stoppage which is often followed by resumption of normal beating.

19–7 Electric Hazards
Excess electric current can overheat wires in buildings and cause fires, as discussed 
in Section 18–6. Electric current can also damage the human body or even be fatal.
Electric current through the human body can cause damage in two ways: (1) heating
tissue and causing burns; (2) stimulating nerves and muscles, and we feel a “shock.”
The severity of a shock depends on the magnitude of the current, how long it acts,
and through what part of the body it passes. A current passing through vital o
