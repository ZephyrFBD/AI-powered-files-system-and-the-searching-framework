 the distance between the charges, and the constant 
is
equal to 
If the two charges have the same sign, the potential
energy is positive for all values of r, and a graph of PE versus r in this case is
shown in Fig. 29–7a. The force is repulsive (the charges have the same sign) and
the curve rises as r decreases; this makes sense because if one particle moves
freely toward the other (r getting smaller), the repulsion slows it down so its KE
gets smaller, meaning PE gets larger. If, on the other hand, the two charges are of
the opposite sign, the potential energy is negative because the product 
is
negative. The force is attractive in this case, and the graph of PE
versus r
looks like Fig. 29–7b. The potential energy becomes more negative as r decreases.
Now let us look at the potential-energy diagram for the formation of a cova-
lent bond, such as for the hydrogen molecule,
The potential energy PE of one
H atom in the presence of the other is plotted in Fig. 29–8. Starting at large r,
