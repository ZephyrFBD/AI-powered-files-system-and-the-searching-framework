73. A 950-kg car strikes a huge spring at a speed of 
(Fig. 11–57), compressing the spring 4.0 m. (a) What is 
the spring stiffness constant of the spring? (b) How long 
is the car in contact with the spring before it bounces off 
in the opposite direction?

74. A mass attached to the end of a spring is stretched a 
distance 
from equilibrium and released. At what dis-
tance from equilibrium will it have (a) velocity equal to half
its maximum velocity, and (b) acceleration equal to half its
maximum acceleration?
75. Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule. The carbon–oxygen
bonds in this molecule act very much like springs.
Figure 11–58 shows one possible way the oxygen atoms 
in this molecule can oscillate: the oxygen atoms oscillate
symmetrically in and out, while the central carbon atom
remains at rest. Hence each oxygen a
