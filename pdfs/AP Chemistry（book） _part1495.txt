larger than those for bonding pairs. (iii) The hybridization 
that corresponds to a trigonal planar electron-domain geom-
etry is sp2. [Section 9.2]

The molecule shown here is difluoromethane 1CH2F22, which is 
used as a refrigerant called R-32. (a) Based on the structure, how 
many electron domains surround the C atom in this molecule? 
(b) Would the molecule have a nonzero dipole moment? (c) If 
the molecule is polar, which of the following describes the di-
rection of the overall dipole moment vector in the molecule: 
(i) from the carbon atom toward a fluorine atom, (ii) from the 
carbon atom to a point midway between the fluorine atoms, 
 
(iii) from the carbon atom to a point midway betw
