FIGURE 20–5 The Earth acts like a 
huge magnet. But its magnetic poles 
are not at the geographic poles (on
the Earth’s rotation axis).
EXERCISE A Does the Earth’s magnetic field have a greater magnitude near the poles
or near the equator? [How can you tell using the field lines in Fig. 20–5?]
Uniform Magnetic Field
The simplest magnetic field is one that is uniform—it doesn’t change in magni-
tude or direction from one point to another. A perfectly uniform field over a large
area is not easy to produce. But the field between two flat parallel pole pieces 
of a magnet is nearly uniform if the area of the pole faces is large compared 
to their separation, as shown in Fig. 20–7. At the edges, the field “fringes” out
somewhat: the magnetic field lines are no longer quite parallel and uniform. The
parallel evenly spaced field lines in the central region of the gap ind
