J>K2 = 2.6 J>K 
If the temperature of the surroundings were not 310 K but rather some temperature infini-
tesimally above 273 K, the melting would be reversible instead of irreversible. In that case, 
the entropy change of the surroundings would equal -22.0 J>K and ∆Suniv would be zero.
In general, any irreversible process results in an increase in the entropy of the uni-
verse, whereas any reversible process results in no change in the entropy of the universe:
Reversible Process:   
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr = 0
Irreversible Process:   
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr 7 0

These equations summarize the second law of thermodynamics. Because sponta-
neous processes are irreversible, we can also state the second law this way:
The entropy of the universe increases for any spontaneous process.
Give It Some Thought
The rusting of iron is spontaneous and is accompanied by a decrease in the entropy 
of the system (the iron and oxygen). What can we conclude about the entropy 
change of the surrou
