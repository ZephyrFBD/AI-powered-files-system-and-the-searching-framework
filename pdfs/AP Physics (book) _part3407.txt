icles from a given alpha-emitting nuclide
are generally monoenergetic; that is, they all have the same
kinetic energy. But the beta particles from a beta-emitting
nuclide have a spectrum of energies. Explain the difference
between these two cases.

CHAPTER 30
Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity
1. Elements of the Periodic Table are distinguished by
(a) the number of protons in the nucleus.
(b) the number of neutrons in the nucleus.
(c) the number of electrons in the atom.
(d) Both (a) and (b).
(e) (a), (b), and (c).
2. A nucleus has
(a) more energy than its component neutrons and protons
have.
(b) less energy than its component neutrons and protons
have.
(c) the same energy as its component neutrons and
protons have.
(d) more energy than its component neutrons and 
protons have when the nucleus is at rest but less
energy than when i
