mechanisms that maintain homeostasis. Which of the
following demonstrates negative feedback by the
endocrine system?
a.
During labor, the fetus exerts pressure on the
uterine wall, inducing the production of
oxytocin, which stimulates uterine wall
contraction. The contractions cause the fetus to
further push on the wall, increasing the
production of oxytocin.
b.
After a meal, blood glucose levels become
elevated, stimulating beta cells of the pancreas to
release insulin into the blood. Excess glucose is
then converted to glycogen in the liver, reducing
blood glucose levels.
c.
At high elevation, atmospheric oxygen is
scarcer. In response to signals that oxygen is
low, the brain decreases an individualâ€™s rate of
respiration to compensate for the difference.
d.
A transcription factor binds to the regulating
region of a gene, blocking the binding of another
transcription factor required for expression.
