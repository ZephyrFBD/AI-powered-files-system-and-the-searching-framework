 the motion of molecules, increasing the frequency and force with which they
collide; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state. For this reason,
heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently. Increasing the pressure on a
system has the same effect. Once reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition
state, the reaction will proceed.
The activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed. The higher the activation energy,
the slower the chemical reaction will be. The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. This reaction
occurs slowly over time because of its high EA. Additionally, the burning of many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will
take place at a negligible rate unless their activation energy is overcome by sufficient heat from a spark. Once they begin to
burn, howe
