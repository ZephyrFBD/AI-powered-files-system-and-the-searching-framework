ts
direction in wire M is opposite to that in wires N and P
(Fig. 20–73). (a) Determine the magnetic force per unit
length on each wire due to the other two. (b) In Fig. 20–73,
determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic
field at the midpoint
of the line between
wire M and wire N.

91. You want to get an idea of the magnitude of magnetic fields
produced by overhead power lines. You estimate that a
transmission wire is about 13 m above the ground. The local
power company tells you that the lines operate at 240 kV and
provide a maximum power of 46 MW. Estimate the magnetic
field you might experience walking under one such power
line, and compare to the Earth’s field.
92. Two long parallel wires 8.20 cm apart carry 19.2-A currents
in the same direction. Deter-
mine the magnetic field
vector at a point P, 12.0 cm
from one wire and 13.0 cm
from the other (Fig. 20–74).
