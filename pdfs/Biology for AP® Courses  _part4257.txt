cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784.
Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate. When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth,
gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere, as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from
escaping. The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and ozone.
Approximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the Earth. This
radiation is converted into thermal radiation on the Earth’s surface, and then a portion of that energy is re-radiated back
into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, however, reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earth’s surface. The more
greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth’s surface. Greenhouse
gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important fa
