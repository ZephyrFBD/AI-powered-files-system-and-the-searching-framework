regardless if they also have
a t or i allele. Only individuals that are tt or ii will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. As shown in
Figure 12.19, you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/
inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Notice from the grid that when considering the tall/dwarf and inflated/
constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios.
Figure 12.19 This figure shows all possible combinations of offspring resulting from a dihybrid cross of pea plants
that are heterozygous for the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted alleles.
Test the hypothesis: You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross the offspring. For best results, this is
repeated with hundreds or even thousands of pea plants. What special precautions should be taken in the crosses and
in growing the plants?
Analyze your data: You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F2 genera
