han biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized
treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side
effects that the individual may experience. Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.
The National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. The Clinical
Proteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein signatures
specific to different types of cancers. The Biomedical Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein signatures and
design effective therapies for cancer patients.
