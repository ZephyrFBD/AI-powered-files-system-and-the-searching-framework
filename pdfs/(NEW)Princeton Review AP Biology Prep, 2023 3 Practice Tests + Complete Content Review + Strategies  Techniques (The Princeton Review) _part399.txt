ne of the phenotypes was favored at one of
the extremes of the normal distribution.
In other words, directional selection “weeds out” one of the phenotypes. In our case, dark moths were favored, and
light moths were practically eliminated. Here’s one more thing to remember: directional selection can happen only if
the appropriate allele—the one that is favored under the new circumstances—is already present in the population.
Two other types of selection are stabilizing selection and disruptive selection. Stabilizing selection means that
organisms in a population with extreme traits are eliminated. This type of selection favors organisms with average or
medium traits. It “weeds out” the phenotypes that are less adaptive to the environment. A good example is birth
weight in human babies. An abnormally small baby has a higher chance of having birth defects; conversely, an
abnormally large baby will have a challenge in terms of a safe birth delivery.
Disruptive selection, on the other hand
