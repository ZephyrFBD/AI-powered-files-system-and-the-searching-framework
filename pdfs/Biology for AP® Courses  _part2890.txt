37. Ectotherms and endotherms have different strategies
for generating and maintaining body heat. Explain why
ectotherms are more dependent on the environment for
body heat than endotherms and how endotherms are able
to generate and maintain body temperature.
a.
Ectotherms use external thermal heat whereas
endotherms use metabolically generated heat to
help regulate and maintain body temperatures.
b.
Ectotherms use external heat to help regulate
and maintain body temperatures whereas
endotherms have constantly varying internal
temperatures.
c.
Ectotherms use metabol
