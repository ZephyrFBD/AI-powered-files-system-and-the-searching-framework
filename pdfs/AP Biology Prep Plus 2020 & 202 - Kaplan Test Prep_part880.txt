Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
According to Table 1, Species C and D differ at positions 18 and 12. Species C
differs from Species A, B, and D at position 18, and Species D differs from
Species A, B, and C at position 12. Thus, a change at nucleotide position 18
corresponds with the branch point that leads to Species C.
A change at nucleotide position 18 in the
branch leads to Species C 
Species C and D diﬀer at positions 18 and 12;
Species C diﬀers from Species A, B, and D at
position 18, while Species D diﬀers from
Species A, B, and C at position 12

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p + q = 1, where p and q represent the allele
frequencies. A population in Hardy-Weinberg
