bench close to each
other. Estimate the magnitude of the gravitational force each exerts on the other.
APPROACH This is an estimate: we let the distance between the centers of the
two people be
(about as close as you can get).
SOLUTION We use Eq. 5–4, which gives
rounded off to an order of magnitude. Such a force is unnoticeably small unless
extremely sensitive instruments are used (
of a pound).

What is the force of gravity acting on a
2000-kg spacecraft when it orbits two Earth radii from the Earth’s center (that is,
a distance  
above the Earth’s surface, Fig. 5–19)? The mass of the
Earth is
APPROACH We could plug all the numbers into Eq. 5–4, but there is a simpler
approach. The spacecraft is twice as far from the Earth’s center as when it is 
at the surface of the Earth. Therefore, since the
