32. A student performed an experiment to investigate how many drops of different liquids could be placed on a
penny before the liquids would overflow off of the surface of the penny. The table shows the data obtained.
Liquid
Mean Number of Drops (±2 SEM*)
Ethanol
22 ± 1.26
Vegetable Oil
6 ± 1.16
Distilled Water
28 ± 1.26
0.5 Molar NaCl
16 ± 1.08
*Standard Error of the Mean
Which of the following best explains the experimental results?
(A) Vegetable oil forms more hydrogen bonds than the other liquids tested.
(B) Distilled water forms more hydrogen bonds than the other liquids tested.
(C) The ions in NaCl are repelled by the metal in the penny.
(D) Ethanol is a larger molecule than water, so ethanol forms more hydrogen bonds than water.
