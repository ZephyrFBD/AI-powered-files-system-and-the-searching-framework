ecause it passes through our body undigested. Why can't fiber be digested and why is it
important to our diet?
a.
The enzymes required to digest cellulose are not produced in human body; undigested fiber adds bulk to the
food easing bowel movements.
b.
The enzymes that digests cellulose cannot bind to the cellulose due to altered active sites; undigested fiber
adds bulk to the food easing bowel movements.
c.
The enzymes required to digest cellulose are not produced in human body; fiber produces energy for the
metabolism.
d.
Competitive inhibitors are not the reason that fiber is indigestible.

Activity
Use a molecular model kit to construct a polysaccharide from several different monosaccharide monomers.
Explain how the structure of the polysaccharide determines its primary function as an energy storage
molecule. Then use your model to describe how changes in structure result in changes in function.
