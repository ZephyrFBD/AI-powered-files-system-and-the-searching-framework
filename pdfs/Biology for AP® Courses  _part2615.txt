 is a result of rapidly dividing cells in
the apical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip. Subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary growth. The growth
of shoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water (roots) or sunlight (shoots).

The influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance, which diminishes the growth of
axillary buds that form along the sides of branches and stems. Most coniferous trees exhibit strong apical dominance,
thus producing the typical conical Christmas tree shape. If the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start
forming lateral branches. Gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus
encouraging the axillary buds to grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape.
