) Transduction involves the transfer of genetic material by viral transmission. Transformation, transposition,
and conjugation do not involve viruses, so choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect.
Short Free-Response
11. (a) Operators serve as binding sites for repressor proteins. Promoters are binding sites for RNA polymerase.
(b) When the repressor is bound to the operator, it blocks RNA polymerase’s access to the structural genes, and
the operon is shut down.
(c) The level of expression of the lac operon will be high.
(d) Lactose is the inducer and will bind to the repressor, removing it from the operator and allowing the operon
to be expressed. Low glucose levels will lead to high levels of cAMP, which will activate the catabolite
activator protein, increasing the expression of the lac operon even more.
12. (a) Based on the data in the table, fructose appears to have no effect on the level of transcription.
(b) The level of transcription is higher when lysine is absent and lower when
