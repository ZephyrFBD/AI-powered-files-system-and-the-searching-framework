t
mean, however, that no power is needed or that no heat is produced in a resistor.
Electrons do move back and forth, and do produce heat. Indeed, the power
transformed in a resistance R at any instant is (Eq. 18–7b)
Because the current is squared, we see that the power is always positive, as
graphed in Fig. 18–22. The quantity 
varies between 0 and 1; and it is not
too difficult to show† that its average value is
as indicated in Fig. 18–22. Thus,
the average power transformed,
is
Since power can also be written 
we also have that
the average power is
The average or mean value of the square of the current or voltage is thus what 
is important for calculating average power:
and
The square
root of each of these is the rms (root-mean-square) value of the current or voltage:
