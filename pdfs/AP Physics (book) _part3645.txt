(or boson) has a corresponding boson (or fermion) partner.

1. Give a reaction between two nucleons, similar to Eq. 32–4,
that could produce a 
2. If a proton is moving at very high speed, so that its kinetic
energy is much greater than its rest energy 
can it
then decay via
3. What would an “antiatom,” made up of the antiparticles to
the constituents of normal atoms, consist of? What might
happen if antimatter, made of such antiatoms, came in
contact with our normal world of matter?
4. What particle in a decay signals the electromagnetic
interaction?
5. (a) Does the presence of a neutrino among the decay prod-
ucts of a particle necessarily mean that the decay occurs
via the weak interaction? (b) Do all decays via the weak
interaction produce a neutrino? Explain.
6. Why is it that a neutron decays via the weak interaction
even though the neutron and one of its decay products
(proton) are strongly interacting?
