 that break down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. In animals, they are common
in liver and kidney cells.
Cytoskeleton
Have you ever wondered what actually holds the cell together and enables it to keep its shape? The shape of a cell is
determined by a network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton. The most important fibers you’ll need to know
are microtubules and microfilaments.
Microtubules, which are made up of the protein tubulin, participate in cellular division and movement. These small
fibers are an integral part of three structures: centrioles, cilia, and flagella. We’ve already mentioned that centrioles
help chromosomes separate during cell division.
Microfilaments, like microtubules, are important for movement. These thin, rodlike structures are composed of the
protein actin. Actin monomers are joined together and broken apart as needed to allow microfilaments to grow and
shrink. Microfilaments assist during cytokinesis, muscle contraction, and formation of pseudop
