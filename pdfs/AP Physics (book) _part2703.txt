ntensity of a light beam is proportional to the square of the amplitude
(Sections 11–9 and 22–5), the intensity of a plane-polarized beam transmitted by
a polarizer is proportional to (
)2, a relation called Malus’ law,
(24;5)
where 
is the incoming intensity and 
is the angle between the polarizer trans-
mission axis and the plane of polarization of the incoming wave.
A Polaroid can be used as a polarizer to produce plane-polarized light 
from unpolarized light, since only the component of light parallel to the axis is 
transmitted. A Polaroid can also be used as an analyzer to determine (1) if light is
polarized and (2) the plane of polarization. A Polaroid acting as an analyzer will
pass the same amount of light independent of the orientation of its axis if the
light is unpolarized; try rotating one lens of a pair of Polaroid sunglasses while
looking through it at a lightbulb. If the light is polarized, however, when you
rotate the Polaroid the transmitted light will be a maximum wh
