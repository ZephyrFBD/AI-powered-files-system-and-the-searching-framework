21. (II) A 2500-kg trailer is attached to a stationary truck at
point B, Fig. 9–61. Determine the normal force exerted by
the road on the rear tires at A, and the vertical force
exerted on the trailer by the support B.
22. (II) A 20.0-m-long uniform beam weighing 650 N rests on
walls A and B, as shown in Fig. 9–62. (a) Find the maxi-
mum weight of a person who can walk to the extreme 
end D without tipping the beam. Find the forces that the
walls A and B exert on the beam when the person is stand-
ing: (b) at D; (c) 2.0 m to the right of A.

23. (II) A 0.75-kg sheet is centered on a clothesline as shown in
Fig.9–63. The clothesline on either side of the hanging sheet
makes an angle of 3.5° with the horizontal. Calculate the
tension in the clothesline (ignore its mass)
