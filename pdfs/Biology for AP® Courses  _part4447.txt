oal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely
independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. Innate
behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. They are “hard wired” into
the system. On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to
changes in the environment.
Innate Behaviors: Movement and Migration
Innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli. The simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary
and rapid response to stimulus. To test the “knee-jerk” reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a
rubber hammer. The stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. This is similar to
the reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually
