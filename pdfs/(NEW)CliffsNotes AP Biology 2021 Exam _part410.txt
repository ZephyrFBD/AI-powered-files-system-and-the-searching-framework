gene pool.
4. Outbreeding, or mating with unrelated partners, increases the possibility of mixing different alleles and creating
new allele combinations.
5. Balanced polymorphism is the maintenance of different phenotypes in a population. Often, a single phenotype
provides the best adaptation, while other phenotypes are less advantageous. In these cases, the alleles for the
advantageous trait increase in frequency, while the remaining alleles decrease. However, examples of polymorphism
(the coexistence of two or more different phenotypes) are observed in many populations. These polymorphisms can
be maintained in the following ways:
Heterozygote advantage occurs when the heterozygous condition bears a greater selective advantage than either
homozygous condition. As a result, both alleles and all three phenotypes are maintained in the population by
selection. For example, the alleles for normal and sickle-cell hemoglobin
proteins (HbA and HbS, respectively) produce three genotypes:
 
HbA
