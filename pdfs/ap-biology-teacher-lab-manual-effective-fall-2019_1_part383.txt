proximately four lab periods of about 45 minutes 
each — one period for students to assemble microrespirometers, if they choose that 
system; one period to conduct Procedures (using respirometers to measure respiration); 
and approximately two periods to conduct their own investigations (Designing and 
Investigation 6 T107

Conducting Your Investigation). If gas pressure sensors are available and students know 
how to use them, they can assemble them in about 10 minutes and proceed directly 
to Procedures. Alternatively, students can design their experiment(s) as a homework 
assignment, and lab groups can communicate through various social networking sites or 
by email. Teachers should allow time for students to share their results and conclusions 
with the class by appropriate means, such as a mini-poster session or traditional lab 
report. Students can work in pairs or small groups to accommodate different class sizes.
