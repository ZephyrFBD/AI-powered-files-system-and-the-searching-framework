ommon metabolic pathways,
alcohol and lactic acid fermentation, are slightly different, the objective of both processes is to
replenish NAD+so that glycolysis can proceed once again. Anaerobic respiration occurs in the cytosol alongside
glycolysis.
Alcohol Fermentation
Alcohol fermentation (or sometimes, just fermentation) occurs in plants, fungi (such as yeasts), and bacteria. The
steps, illustrated in Figure 4-3, are as follows:
1. Pyruvate to acetaldehyde. For each pyruvate, 1 CO2 and 1 acetaldehyde are produced. The CO2 formed is the
source of
 
carbonation in fermented drinks like beer and champagne. 2. Acetaldehyde to ethanol. The important part of this
step is that the
 
energy in NADH is used to drive this reaction, releasing NAD+. For each acetaldehyde, 1 ethanol is made and 1
NAD+ is produced. The
 
ethanol (ethyl alcohol) produced here is the source of alcohol in beer and wine.
It is important that you recognize the objective of this pathway. At first glance, you should wond
