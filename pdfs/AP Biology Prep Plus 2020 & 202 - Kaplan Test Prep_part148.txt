brane only because they subsequently have a lipid molecule
attached to their structure.
Transmembrane proteins are involved not only in carrying materials
across the membrane, but also in cell recognition, cell adhesion, cell
signaling, and enzymatic reactions. Recall that most proteins sticking up
from the surface of the membrane are covered in carbohydrates on the
extracellular surface. The term used to describe the protein- and
carbohydrate-rich coating on the cell surface is glycocalyx. Keep in mind
that these sugars reside exclusively on the exterior of the membrane.

MEMBRANE TRANSPORT MECHANISMS
Membranes are selectively permeable, which means that they allow
some things to pass through, but not others. The main limiting factors
that determine whether a molecule will be able to pass through a cellâ€™s
membrane are the size of the particle and its charge (polarity). Simply
stated, the molecules quickest to pass through the lipid bilayer are those
that are small and non
