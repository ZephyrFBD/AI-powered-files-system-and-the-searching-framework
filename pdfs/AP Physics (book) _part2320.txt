losed loop of
wire there will also be an induced current, which implies there is an electric field
in the wire causing the electrons to start moving. Indeed, this and other results
suggest the important conclusion that
a changing magnetic flux produces an electric field.
This result applies not only to wires and other conductors, but is a general result
that applies to any region in space. Indeed, an electric field will be produced
at any point in space where there is a changing magnetic field.
We can get a simple formula for E in terms of B for the case of electrons in
a moving conductor, as in Fig. 21–11. The electrons feel a force (upwards in
Fig. 21–11b); and if we put ourselves in the reference frame of the conductor, this
force accelerating the electrons implies that there is an electric field in the
conductor. Electric field is defined as the force per unit charge,
where

(Eq. 20–4). Thus the effective field E in the rod must be
(21;4)
which is a useful result.
