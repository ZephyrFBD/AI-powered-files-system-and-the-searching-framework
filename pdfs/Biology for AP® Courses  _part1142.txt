e sections using the scanning objective of your microscope. Notice that the section
is a circle composed of dozens of closely packed individual cells.
3.
Switch to the low-power objective and refocus. With this objective, individual cells are visible.
4.
Switch to the high-power objective and slowly move the slide left to right, and up and down to view all the cells
in the section (Figure 10.10). As you scan, you will notice that most of the cells are not undergoing mitosis but
are in the interphase period of the cell cycle.
Figure 10.10 Slowly scan whitefish blastula cells with the high-power objective as illustrated in image (a)
to identify their mitotic stage. (b) A microscopic image of the scanned cells is shown. (credit “micrograph”:

5.
Practice identifying the various stages of the cell cycle, using the drawings of the stages as a guide (Figure 10.7).

Once you are confident about your identification, begin
