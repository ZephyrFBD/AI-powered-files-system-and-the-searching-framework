st leaves are usually green,
due to the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells. However, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant
pigments that mask the green chlorophyll.
The thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment. Each variation helps a plant species maximize its
chances of survival in a particular habitat. Usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface
areas than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to
minimize water loss.
Structure of a Typical Leaf
Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to
the plant stem by a petiole. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile
leaves. Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules. Most leaves have a midrib,
which tra
