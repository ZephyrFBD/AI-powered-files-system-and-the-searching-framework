at ionize, we see 
that, in this particular case, less than 1% of the acetic acid molecules ionize:
 
Percent ionization of CH3COOH = 0.0023 M
0.30 M
* 100% = 0.77% 
As a general rule, if x is more than about 5% of the initial concentration value, it is better to 
use the quadratic formula. You should always check the validity of any simplifying assump-
tions after you have finished solving a problem.
We have also made one other assumption, namely, that all of the H+ in the solution 
comes from ionization of CH3COOH. Are we justified in neglecting the autoionization of 
H2O? The answer is yesâ€”the additional [H+4 due to water, which would be on the order 
of 10-7 M, is negligible compared to the [H+4 from the acid (which in this case is on the 
order of 10-3 M). In extremely precise work, or in cases involving very dilute solutions of 
acids, we would need to consider the autoionization of water more fully.
Give It Some Thought
Would a 1.0 * 10-8M solution of HCl have pH 6 7, pH = 7, or
