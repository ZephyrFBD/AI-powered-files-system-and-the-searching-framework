d is released to the atmosphere. So rather than discussing
nutrient acquisition, (C) is discussing the process by which plants give
up water to the atmosphere, making it incorrect. Root nodules are
composed of root cells that contain vesicles filled with nitrogen-fixing
bacteria. These bacteria convert nitrogen from the Earth’s atmosphere
into ammonia that can then be used by the plant. Because this process
involves the acquisition of nitrogenous nutrients from the
environment, (D) is correct.

The hypothesis is that the short-rooted parent is heterozygous.
Therefore, the other parent’s genotype must be homozygous recessive.
Crossing the two should theoretically result in a population that is 50%
long-rooted and 50% short-rooted. With 38 seeds, this means that 19
should develop into long-rooted plants and 19 should develop into
short-rooted plants. These are the expected values. The question stem
states that the observed values were 24 short-rooted and 14 l
