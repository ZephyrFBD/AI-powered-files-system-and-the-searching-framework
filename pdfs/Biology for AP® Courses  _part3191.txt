Just-Noticeable Difference
It is easy to differentiate between a one-pound bag of rice and a two-pound bag of rice. There is a one-
pound difference, and one bag is twice as heavy as the other. However, would it be as easy to differentiate
between a 20- and a 21-pound bag?
Question: What is the smallest detectible weight difference between a one-pound bag of rice and a larger
bag? What is the smallest detectible dif
