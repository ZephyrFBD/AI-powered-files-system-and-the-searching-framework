will become extinct. Human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the
exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and
the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra’s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species
of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo
is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of
thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber
and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 38.11). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics,
and biodiesel in Europe. A five-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years 2000–2005 was 3.1 percent. In the
