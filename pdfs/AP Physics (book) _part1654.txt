In fact,
the entropy of a system can be considered a measure of the disorder of the system.
Then the second law of thermodynamics can be stated simply as:
natural processes tend to move toward a state of greater disorder.
Exactly what we mean by disorder may not always be clear, so we now consider a
few examples. Some of these will show us how this very general statement of the
second law applies beyond what we usually consider as thermodynamics.
Let us look at the simple processes mentioned in Section 15–4. First, a jar
containing separate layers of salt and pepper is more orderly than a jar in which the
salt and pepper are all mixed up. Shaking a jar containing separate layers results in
a mixture, and no amount of shaking brings the orderly layers back again. The
natural process is from a state of relative order (layers) to one of relative disorder
(a mixture), not the reverse. That is, disorder increases. Second, a solid coffee cup
is a more “orderly” and useful object than the pie
