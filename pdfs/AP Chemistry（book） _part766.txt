different reactions in our two-step version. As long as we can write 
a series of equations, each with a known value of ∆H, that add up 
to the equation we need, we can calculate the overall ∆H.
*The definition of the standard state 
for gases has been changed to 1 bar 
(1 atm =  
1.013 bar), a slightly lower pressure 
than 1 atm. For most purposes, this change 
makes very little difference in the standard 
enthalpy changes.

By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of the most stable form of any element 
is zero because there is no formation reaction needed when the element is already in its 
standard state. Thus, the values of ∆Hf° for C(graphite), H21g2, O21g2, and the standard 
states of other elements are zero by definition.
