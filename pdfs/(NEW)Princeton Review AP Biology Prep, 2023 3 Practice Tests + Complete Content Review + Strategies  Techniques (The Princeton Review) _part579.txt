This question tests your ability to associate what happens when enzymes are denatured and what would happen
in the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. If
acetylcholinesterase is denatured, acetylcholine will still be released from the presynaptic membrane (the nerve
before the cleft) and continue to diffuse across the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine will still bind to the
postsynaptic membrane (on the nerve after the cleft) because acetylcholine is not degraded. Therefore, you can
eliminate (A), (B), and (C).

B
The ratio of purines to pyrimidines should be constant because purines always bind with pyrimidines, no
matter which ones they may be.

D
Feedback inhibition occurs when something created by a process then inhibits that process. Choices (A) and
(B) involve stimulations, so they can be eliminated. Choice (C) doesn’t make sense because it says that “C” is
an enzyme and the passage says that the enzymes ar
