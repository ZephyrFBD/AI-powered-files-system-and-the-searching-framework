the cell, then the water potential inside the vacuole
would have been higher than outside the cell. High water potential means the water wants to move.
Choice (C) says the water potential would be lower.

This question tests your ability to associate what happens when enzymes are denatured and what would
happen in the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine in the synaptic
cleft. If acetylcholinesterase is denatured, acetylcholine will still be released from the presynaptic
membrane (the nerve before the cleft) and continue to diffuse across the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine will
still bind to the postsynaptic membrane (on the nerve after the cleft) because acetylcholine is not
degraded. Therefore, you can eliminate (A), (B), and (C).

The ratio of purines to pyrimidines should be constant because purines always bind with pyrimidines, no
matter which ones they may be.
