 the strategy is efficient or not. Based on the
data and simulation, we use our model to find the best strategy of having a hot bath.
Besides, we need to consider many additional factors such as the bathtub, the
person and the bubble. We use controlling variables method and sensitivity analysis to
describe and analyze the influences additional factors have on the strategy. We
surprisingly find that many additional factors will have huge impacts on the initial
best strategy. This reminds us of the difficulty to evenly maintain the initial
temperature without wasting too much water, which proves that our model works but
some parameters are greatly sensitive to the model, so it may be wise for the user to
have a spa-style tub with a secondary heating system if he often gets a bath.
Moreover, we make improvements about the process of cooling to revise the
rough detail. We deeply know that our model approximatively simulate the scene of
the problem and strike out the main body of the proble
