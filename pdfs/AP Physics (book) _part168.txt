on time,” part (1), the car moves at constant
speed of 
so  
Once the brakes are applied, part (2), the acceler-
ation is  
and is constant over this time interval. For both parts
a is constant, so we can use Eqs. 2–11.
SOLUTION Part (1). We take  
for the first time interval, when the driver
is reacting (0.50 s): the car travels at a constant speed of 
so
See Fig. 2–16 and the Table in the margin. To find x, the position of the car 
at
(when the brakes are applied), we cannot use Eq. 2–11c because
x is multiplied by a, which is zero. But Eq. 2–11b works:
Thus the car travels 7.0 m during the driver’s reaction time, until the instant
the brakes are applied. We will use this result as input to part (2).
Part (2). During the second time interval, the brakes are applied and the car is
brought to rest. The initial position is 
(result of part (1)), and other
variables are shown in the second Table in the margin. Equation 2–11a doesn’t
contain x; Eq. 2–11b contains x but also the unknown
