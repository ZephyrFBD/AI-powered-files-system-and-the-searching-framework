ax stem are made up of parenchyma cells. Inside the
cortex is a layer of sclerenchyma cells, which make up the fibers in flax rope and clothing. Humans have grown
and harvested flax for thousands of years. In (b) this drawing, fourteenth-century women prepare linen. The (c)
flax plant is grown and harvested for its fibers, which are used to weave linen, and for its seeds, which are the
source of linseed oil. (credit a: modification of work by Emmanuel Boutet based on original work by Ryan R.

Students are examining stem cross-sections under the microscope and sketching their observations. As they are
labeling the different tissues, they realize that they labeled different parts of the stem as parenchyma. Which part of the
stem is made of parenchyma cells?
a.
The cortex and pith are made of parenchyma cells.
b.
The companion cells of the phloem are parenchyma cells.
c.
Fiber cells of the sclerenc
