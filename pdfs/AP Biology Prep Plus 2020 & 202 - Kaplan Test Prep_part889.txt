Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
When tryptophan levels are high, E. coli does not need to synthesize
tryptophan. Tryptophan activates the repressor, which binds to the operator
and blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and thereby blocks
gene expression.
(b) Describe how the trp operon is turned on when tryptophan levels are
low. (1 point)
Description (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
When tryptophan levels are low, E. coli needs to synthesize tryptophan. Thus,
the repressor is inactive and RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, which
promotes gene expression.
At high tryptophan levels, tryptophan activates the repressor protein, which binds to the
operator and blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, inhibiting gene expression
At low tryptophan levels, the repressor protein is inactive, so RNA polymerase is able to bind to
the promoter, promoting gene expression
