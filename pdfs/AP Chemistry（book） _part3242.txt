acid Battery
A 12-V lead–acid automotive battery consists of six voltaic cells in series, each producing 
2 V. The cathode of each cell is lead dioxide 1PbO22 packed on a lead grid (Figure 20.19). 
The anode of each cell is lead. Both electrodes are immersed in sulfuric acid.
The reactions that occur during discharge are
Cathode:  
     PbO21s2 + HSO4
-1aq2 + 3 H+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ PbSO41s2 + 2 H2O1l2
Anode:   
 
  Pb1s2 + HSO4
-1aq2 ¡ PbSO41s2 + H+1aq2 + 2 e-
Overall: PbO21s2 + Pb1s2 + 2 HSO4
-1aq2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ 2 PbSO41s2 + 2 H2O1l2

The standard cell potential can be obtained from the standard reduction 
potentials in Appendix E:

The reactants Pb and PbO2 are the electrodes. Because these reactants are 
solids, there is no need to separate the cell into half-cells; the Pb and PbO2 
cannot come into contact with each other unless one electrode touches 
another. To keep the electrodes from touching, woo
