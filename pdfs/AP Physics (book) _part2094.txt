the equivalent capacitance.
Then we find the charge on each separate capacitor and the voltage across each.
Each step uses Eq. 17–7,
SOLUTION The 4.0-V battery behaves as if it is connected to a capacitance
Therefore the charge Q that leaves the battery,
by Eq. 17–7, is
From Fig. 19–19a, this charge arrives at the negative plate of
so
The charge Q that leaves the positive plate of the battery is split evenly between
and 
(symmetry:
) and is
Next, the volt-
ages across 
and 
have to be the same. The voltage across each capacitor is
obtained using
So

V = QC.

Q = CV.
V = 4.0 V.
