of the cord is fixed to a peg. (b) The end of
the cord is free to move.
Consider next a pulse that travels along a cord which consists of a light section
and a heavy section, as shown in Fig. 11–34. When the wave pulse reaches the
boundary between the two sections, part of the pulse is reflected and part is trans-
mitted, as shown. The heavier the second section of the cord, the less the energy
that is transmitted. (When the second section is a wall or rigid support, very little
is transmitted and most is reflected, as in Fig. 11–33a.) For a sinusoidal wave, the
frequency of the transmitted wave does not change across the boundary because
