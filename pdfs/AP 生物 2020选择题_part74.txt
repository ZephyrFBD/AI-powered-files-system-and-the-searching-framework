 have a high melting temperature; however, this

Learning Objective
Topic
2.A: Describe characteristics of 
a biological concept, process, or 
model represented visually.
ENE-2.H: Explain how 
concentration gradients 
affect the movement 
of molecules across 
membranes.
Tonicity and  
Osmoregulation
(A) 
Correct. Distilled water from chamber B will move to chamber A 
because chamber A has a higher solute concentration.
(B) 
Incorrect. This arrangement would result in no net movement of water 
into chamber A.
(C) 
Incorrect. This arrangement would result in net movement of water into 
chamber B, not chamber A. Distilled water from chamber A will move 
to chamber B because chamber B has a higher solute concentration.
(D) 
Incorrect. This arrangement would result in no net movement of water 
into chamber A.
