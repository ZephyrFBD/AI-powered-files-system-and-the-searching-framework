f 125 mm on the sensor becomes 
per mm on the print.
Hence an 
print would be a sharp photograph. We could go 50%
larger—11
14 or maybe even 12
18 inches.
In order to make very large photographic prints, large-format cameras are used
such as 
film or sensor—and even 
and 
(using sheet film or glass plates).
EXERCISE B The criterion of 0.030 mm as the diameter of a circle of confusion as
acceptable sharpness is how many dots per mm on the sensor?
Telephotos and Wide-angles
Camera lenses are categorized into normal, telephoto, and wide angle, according
to focal length and film size. A normal lens covers the sensor or film with a field
of view that corresponds approximately to that of normal vision. A “normal” lens
for 35-mm film has a focal length of 50 mm. The best digital cameras aim for a
sensor of the same size†
. (If the sensor is smaller, digital cam-
eras sometimes specify focal lengths to correspond with classic 35-mm cameras.)
Telephoto lenses act like telescopes to magnify imag
