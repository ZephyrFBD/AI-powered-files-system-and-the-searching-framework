pheric pressure, defined as the force exerted by the atmosphere on a given surface area.
You can demonstrate the existence of atmospheric pressure with an empty plastic 
water bottle. If you suck on the mouth of the empty bottle, chances are you can cause 
the bottle to partially cave in. When you break the partial vacuum you have created, the 
bottle pops out to its original shape. The bottle caves in because, once youâ€™ve sucked out 
some of the air molecules, the air molecules in the atmosphere exert a force on the out-
side of the bottle that is greater than the force exerted by the lesser number of air mole-
cules inside the bottle. 
We can calculate the magnitude of the atmospheric pressure using Equation 10.1. 
The force, F, exerted by any object is the product of its mass, m, and its acceleration, a : 
F = ma. When applied to our atmosphere, the force is the gravitational force, which is 
also commonly called weight. The acceleration is that due to gravity, g = 9.8 m>s2. Thus,
