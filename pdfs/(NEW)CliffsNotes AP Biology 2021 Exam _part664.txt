Population cycles are fluctuations in population size in response to varying effects of limiting factors. For example,
since many limiting factors are density-dependent, they will have a greater effect when the population size is large
as compared to when the population size is small. In addition, a newly introduced population may grow
exponentially beyond the carrying capacity of the habitat before limiting factors inhibit growth (Figure 16-5). When
limiting factors do bring the population under control, the population size may decline to levels lower than the
carrying capacity (or it may even crash to extinction). Once reduced below carrying capacity, however, limiting
factors may ease, and population growth may renew. In some cases, a new carrying capacity, lower than the original,
may be established (perhaps because the habitat was damaged by the excessively large population). The population
may continue to fluctuate about the carrying c
