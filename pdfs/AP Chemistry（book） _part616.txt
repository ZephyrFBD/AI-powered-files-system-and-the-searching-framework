 13.0 M)1Vconc2 = 10.10 M)1450 mL2 
 1Vconc2 =
10.10 M)1450 mL2
3.0 M
= 15 mL
Either way, we see that if we start with 15 mL of 3.0 M H2SO4 and 
dilute it to a total volume of 450 mL, the desired 0.10 M solution 
will be obtained.
Check The calculated volume seems reasonable because a small 
volume of concentrated solution is used to prepare a large volume 
of dilute solution.
Comment The first approach can also be used to find the final 
concentration when two solutions of different concentrations 
are mixed, whereas the second approach, using Equation 4.33, 
can be used only for diluting a concentrated solution with pure 
solvent.
