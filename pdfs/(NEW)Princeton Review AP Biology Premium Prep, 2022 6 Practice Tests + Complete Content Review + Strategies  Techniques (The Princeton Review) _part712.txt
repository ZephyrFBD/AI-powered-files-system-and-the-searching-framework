The Weddell seal stores twice as much oxygen as humans. Calculate the liters per kilograms weight for
both the seal and man using the information at the bottom of the chart. The Weddell seal stores 0.058
liters/kilograms (25.9 liters/450 kilograms) compared to 0.028 liters/kilograms (1.95 liters/70 kilograms)
in humans.

C
The most plausible answer is that blood is redirected toward the central nervous system, which permits
the seal to navigate for long durations. Choice (A) is incorrect; the seal does not need to increase the
number of red blood cells in the nervous system. Choice (B) can also be eliminated, as the seal does not
need to increase the amount of oxygen to the skeletal system. Eliminate (D) because the diversion of
blood does not increase the concentration of oxygen in the lungs.

When the level of CTP is low in a cell, the metabolic traffic down the pathway increases. This pathway is
controlled by feedback inhibition. The f
