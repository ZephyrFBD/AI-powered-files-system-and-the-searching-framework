a black sheep could be BB × BB, BB × Bb, BB × bb, or Bb × Bb. Thus, there is no one single genotype for
either parent. Answer choice D is incorrect because although one parent would always be black, you cannot be
certain whether the second parent is black or white.
7. D. In the CCSS × ccss cross, CCSS produces only CS gametes, and ccss produces only cs gametes. Thus, all
offspring are CcSs.
8. B. The cross of CcSs × CcSs is the same kind of cross illustrated in Figure 8-5. Among the 16 genotypes in the
Punnett square, only one would be ccss.
9. C. The cross of CcSs × CcSs is the same kind of cross illustrated in Figure 8-5. Among the 16 genotypes in the
Punnett square, 9 would be normal for both traits (1 of CCSS, 2 of CCSs, 2 of CcSS, and 4 of CcSs).
10. A. The question involves the progeny of the cross ttRR × TTR′R′. Since ttRR produces only tR gametes, and TTR
′R′ produces only TR′ gametes, all progeny will be TtRR′. The Tt genotype codes for tall, and RR′ codes for pink.
