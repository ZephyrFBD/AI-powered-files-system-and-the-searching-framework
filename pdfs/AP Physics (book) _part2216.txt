If we use right-hand-rule-1 of Fig. 20–8d, we see that the lines of 
are as shown 
in Fig. 20–26b. Then using right-hand-rule-2 of Fig. 20–11c, we see that the force
exerted on 
will be to the left in Fig. 20–26b. That is,
exerts an attractive force
on 
(Fig. 20–27a). This is true as long as the currents are in the same direction.
If 
is in the opposite direction from 
right-hand-rule-2 indicates that the force 
is in the opposite direction. That is,
exerts a repulsive force on 
(Fig. 20–27b).
Reasoning similar to that above shows that the magnetic field produced by 
exerts an equal but opposite force on 
We expect this to be true also from
Newton’s third law. Thus, as shown in Fig. 20–27, parallel currents in the sam
