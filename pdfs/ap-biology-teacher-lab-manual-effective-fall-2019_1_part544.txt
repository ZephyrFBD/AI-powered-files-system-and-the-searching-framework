ion is “bacterium,” you are on the right track. 
 Genetic 
transformation of bacteria most often occurs when bacteria take up plasmids from 
their environment. Plasmids are not part of the main DNA of a bacterium. They are 
small, circular pieces of DNA that usually contain genes for one or more traits that 
may be beneficial to survival. Many plasmids contain genes that code for resistance to 
antibiotics like ampicillin and tetracycline. [Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are responsible 
for a number of human health concerns, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
 
aureas (MRSA) infections.] Other plasmids code for an enzyme, toxin, or other protein 
that gives bacteria with that plasmid some survival advantage. 
 In nature, bacteria may 
swap these beneficial plasmids from time to time. This process increases the variation
