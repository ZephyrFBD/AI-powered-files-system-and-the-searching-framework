20.1 | Organizing Life on Earth
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
Why do scientists need a comprehensive classification system to study living organisms?
•
What are the different levels of the taxonomic classification system?
•
How are systematics and taxonomy related to phylogeny?
•
What are the components and purpose of a phylogenetic tree?
Connection for AP® Courses
In prior chapters we explored how all organisms on Earth, extant and extinct, evolved from common ancestry. Supporting
this claim are core features and processes, such as a common genetic code and metabolic pathways, which evolved billions
of years ago and are widely distributed among organisms living today. The evolutionary history and relationship of an
organism or a group of organisms is called phylogeny. Scientists often construct phylogenetic trees based on evidence
drawn from multiple disciplines to illustrate evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms.
