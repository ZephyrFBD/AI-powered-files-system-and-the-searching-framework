lectively
modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER: the rough
ER and the smooth ER, respectively.
The hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space. The membrane of the ER, which is a
phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.
Rough ER
The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a
studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope (Figure 4.19).

Ribosomes transfer their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the RER where they undergo structural modifications,
such as folding or the acquisition of side chains. These modified proteins will be incorporated into cellular membranesâ€”the
