s), it does not explain
anything about glycolysis. In fact, choice D explains the process by
which aerobic respiration evolved in early life, but it does not
explain when that process occurred. (ENE-1)
(D) Choices A, B, and C all describe events that occur during cell
respiration and lead up to the production of ATP. However, the most
important event in respiration is the production of ATP. (ENE-1)
(A) This is a fact. No CO2 is produced during oxidative
phosphorylation. (ENE-1)
(C) Glycolysis occurs in the first phase of cell respiration and does
not require oxygen. The first organisms on Earth were probably
anaerobes because no free oxygen was available in the atmosphere.
Choices A, B, and D all require free oxygen. (ENE-1)
(A) Choices Bâ€“D are all correct statements about respiration, but they
are not examples of a feedback mechanism. Choice A is an example
of negative feedback because when plenty of ATP is available in the
cell to meet demand, respiration slows down, conserving valua
