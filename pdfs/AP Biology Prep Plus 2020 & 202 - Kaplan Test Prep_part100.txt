lecule of heredity. It is replicated and
passed to oï¬€spring. The RNA viruses that use RNA as their
genomes use RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) made of
protein to copy RNA from RNA. In 2013, Antonio C. Ferretti and
Gerald F. Joyce reported on a pair of RNA enzymes they had
designed that were capable of copying themselves. The doubling
rate of these RNA-based RdRPs was about 20 minutes (about the
same as that of many bacteria). What is the significance of this
finding?
It proved beyond any doubt that RNA evolved first.
(A)
It showed that neither DNA nor protein were required for the
replication of heritable information.
(B)
It demonstrated that spontaneous generation was possible.
(C)
It disproved the RNA world hypothesis because it showed that
RNA could be useful only as an intermediate between DNA and
protein.
(D)
5. A popular criticism of the theory of evolution is the assertion that
adaptations seen in nature could not have evolved by random
chance. Which of the following best
