ns and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent. Instead, these changes are
temporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open
or closed) as needed. A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins
and DNA. If a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region
encoding that gene. This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called
transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription. If a
gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed
chromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access
to the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.7).
