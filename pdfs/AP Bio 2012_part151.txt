Essential Knowledge
3.A.2: In eukaryotes, heritable information is passed to 
the next generation via processes that include the cell 
cycle, mitosis, or meiosis plus fertilization.
Science Practice
5.3: The student can evaluate the evidence provided by 
data sets in relation to a particular scientific question.
Learning Objective 
3.11: The student is able to evaluate evidence provided by 
data sets to support the claim that heritable information 
is passed from one generation to another generation 
through mitosis, or meiosis followed by fertilization. 
(A)
This option is incorrect because if the environment determined the flower  
color, then the occasional white and pink flower would not be seen in the  
original environment.
(B)
This option is incorrect because there is no indication of the stages of flower 
development, and the 3:1 ratios in the first two crosses would not be seen if the 
stage of flower development were the controlling factor.
(C)
