open. At excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the
membraneâ€”a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory
cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na+ channels in the axon hillock
open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell (Figure 26.10 and Figure 26.11). Once the sodium channels open, the neuron
completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are considered an "all-or nothing"
event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. Once depolarization is
complete, the cell must now "reset" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish this, the Na+ channels
close and cannot be opened. Thi
