Apparent brightness. Suppose a star has luminosity equal
to that of our Sun. If it is 10 ly away from Earth, how much dimmer will it appear?
APPROACH We use the inverse square law in Eq. 33–1 to determine the relative
brightness 
since the luminosity L is the same for both stars.
SOLUTION Using the inverse square law, the star appears dimmer by a factor
