igure, calculate the fraction of 
the volume in a container actually occupied by Ar atoms 
(a) at STP
, (b) at 200 atm pressure and 0 °C. (Assume for 
simplicity that the ideal-gas equation still holds.)

Large amounts of nitrogen gas are used in the manufac-
ture of ammonia, principally for use in fertilizers. Suppose 
120.00 kg of N21g2 is stored in a 1100.0-L metal cylinder 
at 280 °C. (a) Calculate the pressure of the gas, assuming 
ideal-gas behavior. (b) By using the data in Table 10.3, 
calculate the pressure of the gas according to the van der 
Waals equation. (c) Under the conditions of this problem, 
which correction dominates, the one for finite volume of 
gas molecules or the one for attractive interactions?

Cyclopropane, a gas used with oxygen as a general anes-
thetic, is composed of 85.7% C and 14.3% H by mass. (a) 
If 1.56 g of cyclopropane has a volume of 1.00 L at 0.984 
atm and 50.0 °C, what is the molecular formula of cyclo-
propane? (b) Jud
