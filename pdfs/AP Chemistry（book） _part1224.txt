them in the periodic table. The noble gases have very stable 
electron arrangements, as evidenced by their high ionization energies, low affinity for 
additional electrons, and general lack of chemical reactivity. 
 (Section 7.8) Because 
all the noble gases except He have eight valence electrons, many atoms undergoing 
reactions end up with eight valence electrons. This observation has led to a guide-
line known as the octet rule: Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons until they are 
surrounded by eight valence electrons.
An octet of electrons consists of full s and p subshells in an atom. In a Lewis symbol, 
an octet is shown as four pairs of valence electrons arranged around the element symbol, 
as in the Lewis symbols for Ne and Ar in Figure 8.2. There are exceptions to the octet rule, 
as we will see in Section 8.7, but it provides a useful framework for introducing many
