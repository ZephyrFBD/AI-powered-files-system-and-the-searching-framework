Digestive Phases
The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. The first phase of ingestion, called the cephalic phase, is
controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects—such as sight, sense, and smell—trigger
the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic
phase can also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato
chip, the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach
to receive food.
The gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic
phase. Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the
stomach, (2) a decrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the pr
