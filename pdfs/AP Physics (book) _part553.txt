). What is the ratio of a person’s apparent
weight to her real weight at (a) the top, and (b) the bottom?
55. (II) At what rate must a cylindrical spaceship rotate if occu-
pants are to experience simulated gravity of 0.70 g? Assume
the spaceship’s diameter is 32 m, and give your answer as
the time needed for one revolution. (See Question 9,
Fig 5–33.)

of a planet with period T, the density (
mass per unit
volume) of the planet is

the surface orbits with a period of 85 min. Approximate
the Earth as a uniform sphere.

37. (II) A hypothetical planet has a mass 2.80 times that of
Earth, but has the same radius. What is g near its surface?
38. (II) If you doubled the mass and tripled the radius of a
planet, by what factor would g at its surface change?
39. (II) Calculate the effective value of g, the a
