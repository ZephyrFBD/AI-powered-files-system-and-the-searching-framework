their results as the relative increase or decrease in body size
relative to present size. Temperatures are below average during
glacial periods and above average during interglacial periods.

6. The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH),
which causes the anterior pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) in the bloodstream. The thyroid gland responds to
TSH by secreting the hormone thyroxine, which contains iodine.
When iodine is missing in a d
