e the pH and percentage of HF molecules ionized in a 0.10 M HF solution.
Sample Exercise 16.13 
Using the Quadratic Equation to Calculate pH and Percent Ionization
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to calculate the percent ionization of a solu-
tion of HF
. From Appendix D, we find Ka = 6.8 * 10-4.
Plan We approach this problem as for previous equilibrium 
problems: We write the chemical equation for the equilibrium 
and tabulate the known and unknown concentrations of all 
species. We then substitute the equilibrium concentrations into 
the equilibrium-constant expression and solve for the unknown 
concentration of H+.
Polyprotic Acids
Acids that have more than one ionizable H atom are known as polyprotic acids. Sulfu-
rous acid 1H2SO32, for example, can undergo two successive ionizations:
 
H2SO31aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + HSO3
-1aq2                      Ka1 = 1.7 * 10-2 
[16.31]
 
HSO3
-1aq2 ∆ H+1aq2 + SO3
2-1aq2                        Ka2 = 6.4 * 10-8 
[16.32]
Note that the acid-dissociation const
