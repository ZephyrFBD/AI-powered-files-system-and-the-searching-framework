tivating and manipulating fungal cells.
Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978.
Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of
differences in the gene product. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children.
The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.
Transgenic Animals
Although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a
eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such
as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic
animals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are express
