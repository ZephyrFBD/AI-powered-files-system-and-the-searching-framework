ves down a concentration gradient (from high to low concentration)
using integral membrane proteins
describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components including phospholipids,
cholesterol, proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids (sugar chains attached to proteins or lipids, respectively),
resulting in a fluid character (fluidity)
combination of carbohydrates and lipids
combination of carbohydrates and proteins
molecule with the ability to bond with water; “water-loving”
molecule that does not have the ability to bond with water; “water-hating”
situation in which extracellular fluid has a higher osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell, resulting in water
moving out of the cell
situation in which extracellular fluid has a lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell, resulting in water
moving into the cell
protein integrated into the membrane structure that interacts extensively with the hydrocarbon chains of
membrane lipids and often spans the membrane; these
