Loading the Gel 
Before loading your gel with samples of DNA, you should practice using the pipette 
or other loading device. One easy way to do this is to slowly aspire a sample of buffer 
and expel it into a “pretend well” on a paper towel (“pretend gel”). Your teacher might 
suggest another method for practicing how to load gels. Keep practicing until you feel 
comfortable loading and expelling a sample. 
Make sure you record the order in which you load the samples. Be sure to use a fresh 
loading device (either plastic micropipette or other type of pipette) for each sample. Be 
sure you know how to use the pipette properly. When in doubt, ask your teacher. Take 
care not to puncture the bottom of the well with the pipette tip when you load your 
samples. 
Step 1 Load 15–20 μL of each sample of DNA into a separate well in the gel, as shown in 
Figure 4.
