Filling the Unit Cell
The lattice by itself does not define a crystal structure. To generate a crystal structure, 
we need to associate an atom or group of atoms with each lattice point. In the simplest 
case, the crystal structure consists of identical atoms, and each atom lies directly on 
a lattice point. When this happens, the crystal structure and the lattice points have 
identical patterns. Many metallic elements adopt such structures, as we will see in Sec-
tion 12.3. Only for solids in which all the atoms are identical can this occur; in other 
words, only elements can form structures of this type. For compounds, even if we were 
to put an atom on every lattice point, the points would not be identical because the 
atoms are not all the same.
In most crystals, the atoms are not exactly coincident with the lattice points. 
Instead, a group of atoms, called a motif, is associated with each lattice point. The unit 
cell contains a speci
