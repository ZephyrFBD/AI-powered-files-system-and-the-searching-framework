addition, by binding to surface antigens of nonself cells, antibodies stimulate complement proteins to bring about the
lysis of pathogens.
When B cells encounter antigens that specifically bind to their antibodies, the B cells proliferate, producing two
kinds of daughter B cells, as follows:
Plasma cells are B cells that release their specific antibodies,
which then circulate through the body, binding to antigens.
Memory cells are long-lived B cells that do not release their
antibodies in response to the immediate antigen invasion. Instead,
the memory cells circulate in the body and respond quickly to
eliminate any subsequent invasion by the same antigen. This
mechanism provides immunity to many diseases after the first
occurrence of the disease.
2. T cells. T cells are lymphocytes that originate in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus gland(remember T
cell for thymus). Like B cells, the plasma membranes of T cells have antigen receptors. However, these receptors are
not antibodi
