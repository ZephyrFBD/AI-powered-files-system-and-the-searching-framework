 idea
that ribosomal RNA both encodes and synthesizes
proteins.
B. Describe a hypothesis for the origin of life on Earth
that combines the dual functionality of RNA and the
function of retroviral reverse transcriptase to propose a
mechanism leading to an ancient, acellular lineage of very
large, double-stranded DNA viruses and a first DNA-
based cellular life form.
C. Like viruses, the nucleus of a eukaryote uses the
machinery of the cell to transcribe DNA and synthesize
proteins. Evaluate the possibility of the origin of Eukarya
by specialization of a very large double-stranded DNA
virus.
50. Viruses evolve but leave no fossil evidence that can be
used to construct phylogenies. However, viral DNA,
especially that of retroviruses, is commonly found in the
host genome. By comparing sequences from the same
virus integrated at different points in time, the evolutionary
history of the virus can be constructed. The viral genomes
are typically found incomplete, in segments, and
interrupted b
