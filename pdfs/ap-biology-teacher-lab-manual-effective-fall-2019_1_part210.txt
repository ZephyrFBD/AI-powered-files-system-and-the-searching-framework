•  5A: Perform Mathematical Calculations 
■ ARE STUDENTS READY TO COMPLETE A SUCCESSFUL 
INQUIRY-BASED, STUDENT-DIRECTED INVESTIGATION? 
Students will be challenged to think about an idealized life cycle of a population of 
hypothetical organisms that serves as the basis for the modeling exercise. You might wish 
to review life cycles, even though this topic is generally taught in elementary grades. It is 
not unusual for students to have an incomplete understanding of an organism’s life cycle. 
Try working through an idealized life cycle and population as a class before 
the students view the investigation. Specifically, use the modeling guidelines and 
assumptions described in the student investigation as a road map for your instruction as 
you and your students try to conceptualize this idealized population. Use questions such 
as the following: 
•  Can you describe the life cycle of an organism?  
•  How does this life cycle work in a population?  
•  How would you tr
