th the
aerobic phase
In a hydroelectric power plant, the energy of falling water turns a
turbine, converting kinetic energy to mechanical energy. Next a
generator converts the mechanical energy from the turbine into
electrical energy. Which process in the production of ATP in
cellular respiration is most similar to this process in a hydroelectric
plant?
citric acid cycle
glycolysis
oxidative phosphorylation
fermentation
Answers Explained
(D) Oxidation is the loss of protons, hydrogen, or electrons, while
reduction is the gain of protons, hydrogen, or electrons. In the case
of aerobic respiration, glucose loses hydrogen to oxygen, and water
vapor is formed and released. Animals breathe out this waste water
vapor. (ENE-1)
(D) Oxygen is a raw material. This reaction is not endergonic
because energy in the form of ATP is on the right side of the
equation; it is being released. Choice C is not a correct statement
because energy cannot be created or destroyed. Only ATP can be
created or dest
