have disintegrated. Companion cells are found alongside the sieve-tube cells, providing
them with metabolic support. The companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve-tube cells,
which lack some cellular organelles.
Ground Tissue
Ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells, but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help
support the stem. The ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith, while the
layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex.
Growth in Stems
Growth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen. Some plants, especially those that are woody, also increase in
thickness during their life span. The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth, and is the
result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth
of the plant, and is caus
