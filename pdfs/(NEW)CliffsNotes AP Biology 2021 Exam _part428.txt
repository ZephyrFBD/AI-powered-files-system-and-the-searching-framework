Microevolution vs. Macroevolution
There are two areas of evolutionary study:
1. Microevolution describes the details of how populations of organisms change from generation to generation and
how new species originate. Microevolution is the subject of the previous sections in this chapter.
2. Macroevolution describes general patterns of change in groups of related species that have occurred over broad
periods of geologic time. The patterns determine phylogeny, the evolutionary relationships among species and
groups of species. Different interpretations of the fossil evidence have led to the development of two contrasting
theories for the pace of macroevolution and the development of evolutionary history (Figure 10-4).

Phyletic gradualism argues that evolution occurs by the gradual accumulation of small changes. Individual
speciation events or major changes in lineages occur over long periods of geologic time, from hundred
