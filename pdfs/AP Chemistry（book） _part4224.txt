epts a proton to form NH3OH+. 
As a general rule, nonbonding electron pairs on nitrogen atoms 
are more basic than nonbonding electron pairs on oxygen atoms.  
Figure 16.17 The range of pH values is so large that we can’t 
show the effects using a single indicator (see Figure 16.8). Figure

of the HOY molecules remain undissociated.

Figure 17.7 25.00 mL. The number of moles of added base needed 
to reach the equivalence point remains the same. Therefore, by dou-
bling the concentration of added base the volume needed to reach 
the equivalence point is halved. Figure 17.9 The volume of base 
needed to reach the equivalence point would not change because 
this quantity does not depend on the strength of the acid. However, 
the pH at the equivalence point, which is greater than 7 for a weak 
acid–strong base titration, would decrease to 7 because hyd
