es not aﬀect the expression of the lac operon,
so the enzymes needed to metabolize lactose would be continuously
produced. (B) is incorrect because the operator next to the structural
genes is not blocked by a repressor, so the lac operon would be
expressed whether lactose is present or absent. (D) is incorrect
because bacterial cells do not synthesize lactose, which is a sugar
found mostly in milk.

Learning Objective: 14.3
The measured proteins are most likely inhibitors of the gibberellin-
dependent transcription factors that prevent the transcription factors
from binding to the DNA. Gibberellin induces transcription by
removing the inhibitory proteins. Once the inhibitory proteins are
degraded, the transcription factors can bind to DNA and transcription
from DNA into gibberellin-dependent mRNAs takes place. The correct
answer is (A). (B) is incorrect because the degraded proteins are
inhibitors of the gibberellin-dependent transcription factors not a
source of amino acids. (C)
