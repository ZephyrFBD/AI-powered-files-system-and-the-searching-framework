 10.106 Assume that a single cylinder of an automobile engine has 
a volume of 524 cm3. (a) If the cylinder is full of air at 74 °C 
 
   
and 0.980 atm, how many moles of O2 are present? (The 
mole fraction of O2 in dry air is 0.2095.) (b) How many 
grams of C8H18 could be combusted by this quantity of 
O2, assuming complete combustion with formation of 
CO2 and H2O?

Assume that an exhaled breath of air consists of 
74.8% N2, 15.3% O2, 3.7% CO2, and 6.2% water vapor. 
(a) If the total pressure of the gases is 0.985 atm, calcu-
late the partial pressure of each component of the mix-
ture. (b) If the volume of the exhaled gas is 455 mL and 
its temperature is 37 °C, calculate the number of moles of 
CO2 exhaled. (c) How many grams of glucose 1C6H12O62 
would need to
