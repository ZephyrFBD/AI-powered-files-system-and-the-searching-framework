Free-Response Questions
Directions: There are two types of free-response questions on the AP exam: short questions and long questions.
Short free-response questions require about6minutes to answer. Long free-response questions require about 20
minutes to answer. Long questions have multiple parts, sometimes offering you a choice of questions to answer.
