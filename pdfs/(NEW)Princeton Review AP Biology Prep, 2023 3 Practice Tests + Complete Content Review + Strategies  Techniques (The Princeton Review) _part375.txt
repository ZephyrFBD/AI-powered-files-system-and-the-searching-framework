Summary
DNA is the genetic material of the cell.
DNA structure is composed of two antiparallel complementary strands, including:
Deoxyribose sugar and phosphate backbone connected by phosphodiester bonds, with nitrogenous bases
hydrogen bonded together pointing toward the middle. The two strands are oriented antiparallel with 3′ and
5′ ends and twist into a double helix.
Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine.
All the DNA in a cell is the genome. It is divided up into chromosomes, which are divided up into genes that
each encode a particular genetic recipe.
DNA replication provides two copies of the DNA for cell division, which involves the following steps:
Helicase begins replication by unwinding DNA and separating the strands at the origin of replication.
Topoisomerases reduce supercoiling ahead of the replication fork.
RNA primase places an RNA primer down on the template strands.
