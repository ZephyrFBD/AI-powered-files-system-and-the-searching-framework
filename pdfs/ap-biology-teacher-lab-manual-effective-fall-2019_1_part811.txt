an substitute 6.0 mL of buffer solution of pH 5 
for the distilled water, and so forth. 
•  Cover each test tube with a piece of Parafilm, and gently mix. 
Step 2 Combine the substrate and enzyme tubes for all six pairs (total volume 15.0 mL 
per pair), cover with Parafilm, gently mix, and place the tubes back in the test tube rack. 
Immediately begin timing the reactions. 
Step 3 Record the observed color for each tube at 0 minutes and again at the time you 
chose based on your results in Procedure 1. (Again, a cell phone and/or camera are 
excellent ways to record color change.)

Step 4 Use the palette/color chart (Figure 1) to help you quantify the changes you observe. 
Graph your data as color intensity versus pH. What conclusions can you draw from your 
results? 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
You now have the basic information and tools needed to explore enzymes in more depth 
on your own. In this part of the lab, you wi
