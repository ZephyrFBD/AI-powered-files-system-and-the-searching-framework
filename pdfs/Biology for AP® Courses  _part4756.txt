Agricultural Diversity
Since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting
crop varieties. This crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. For example,
potatoes were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia. The potatoes grown

to thrive at particular elevations and soil and climate conditions. The diversity is driven by
