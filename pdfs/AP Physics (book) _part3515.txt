roper value of 
to absorb photons of a particular frequency f. By varying f,
absorption by different planes can be measured. Alternately, if the field 
gradient is applied after the RF pulse, the frequency of the emitted photons 
will be a measure of where they were emitted. If a magnetic field gradient 
in one direction is applied during excitation (absorption of photons) and photons
of a single frequency are transmitted, only H nuclei in one thin slice will be
excited. By applying a gradient during reemission in a direction perpendicular to
the first, the frequency f of the reemitted radiation will represent depth in that
slice. Other ways of varying the magnetic field throughout the volume of the
body can be used in order to correlate NMR frequency with position.
A reconstructed image based on the density of H atoms (that is, the intensity
of absorbed or emitted radiation) is not very interesting. More useful are images
based on the rate at which the nuclei decay back to the ground
