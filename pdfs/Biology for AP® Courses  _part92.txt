Communication; and Big Idea 4, Systems and Interactions. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life, Big Idea
1, and all organisms require energy and molecules to carry out life functions, such as growth and reproduction, Big Idea 2.
Living systems also store, transmit, and respond to information, from DNA sequences to nerve impulses and behaviors, Big
Idea 3. All biological systems interact, and these interactions result in emergent properties and characteristics unique to life,
