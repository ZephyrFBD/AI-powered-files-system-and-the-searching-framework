G1, S, G2.
The most important phase is the S phase. That’s when the cell replicates its genetic material. The first thing a cell
has to do before undergoing mitosis is to duplicate all of its chromosomes, which contain the organism’s DNA
“blueprint.” During interphase, every single chromosome in the nucleus is duplicated.
You’ll notice that the original chromosome and its duplicate are still linked, like conjoined twins. These identical
strands of DNA are now called sister chromatids. The chromatids are held together by a structure called the
centromere. You can think of each chromatid as a chromosome, but because they remain attached, they are called
chromatids instead. To be called a chromosome, each needs to have its own centromere. Once the chromatids
separate, they will be full-fledged chromosomes.
Cell Cycle Regulation
We’ve already said that replication occurs during the S phase of interphase, so what happens during G1 and G2?
During these stages, the cell performs metabolic rea
