om a small animal and a large animal, the tissue from the small animal
would have a higher rate of metabolism.
When animals have excess energy, they grow and store energy. When they are deficient, then they use up their
stores and lose mass and eventually die.
Body temperature is one way that animals must respond to their environment. Endotherms are animals that
generate their own body heat through metabolism. Ectotherms lack an internal mechanism to control body
temperature. Instead they regulate their temperature behaviorally by seeking out cool or warm places. One example
is a lizard on a warm rock.
A big part of behavior is communication. This is important between members of the same species to coordinate
group behavior. Animals use visual, auditory, chemical, tactile, and electrical signals to indicate dominance, find
food, establish territory, and reproduce successfully. Communication is also important between members of
different species that are engaged in cooperative behaviors
