Did you remember to have a pair of electrons travel down the ETC? What would happen if only one
electron reached oxygen?

Dinitrophenol (DNP) is an uncoupler that makes the inner mitochondrial membrane leaky to protons. It was used
until 1938 as a weight loss drug. What effect would DNP have on the change in pH across the inner mitochondrial
membrane and the overall process of cellular respiration? Why do you think DNP might be an effective weight-
loss drug? Why is DNP no longer used?

Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, a component of the electron transport chain. If cyanide poisoning occurs,
would you expect the pH of the intermembrane space to increase or decrease? Explain the effect of cyanide on
ATP synthesis.
