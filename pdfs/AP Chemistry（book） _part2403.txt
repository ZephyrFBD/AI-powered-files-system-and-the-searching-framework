CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
When a solvent is a reactant or product in an equilibrium, its concentration is omit-
ted from the equilibrium-constant expression, provided the concentrations of reactants 
and products are low, so that the solvent is essentially a pure substance. Applying this 
guideline to an equilibrium involving water as a solvent,
 
H2O1l2 + CO3 
2-1aq2 ∆ OH-1aq2 + HCO3
-1aq2 
[15.21]
gives an equilibrium-constant expression that does not contain 3H2O4:
 
Kc =
3OH-43HCO3

Each of these mixtures was placed in a closed container and allowed to
