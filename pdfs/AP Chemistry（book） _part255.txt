1. Each element is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.
Dalton’s Atomic Theory
An atom of the element oxygen
An atom of the element nitrogen
2. All atoms of a given element are identical, but the atoms of one element

3. Atoms of one element cannot be changed into atoms of a different element

4. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one
 
element combine; a given compound
