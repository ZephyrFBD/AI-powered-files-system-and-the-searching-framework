of the angular momentum is usually specified by giving its component 
along the z axis (this choice is arbitrary). Then

The values of

from theory (which relates it to 
), but from experiment. It was found that
when a gas-discharge tube was placed in a magnetic field, the spectral lines
were split into several very closely spaced lines. This splitting, known as the
Zeeman effect, implies that the energy levels must be split (Fig. 28–8), and thus
that the energy of a state depends not only on n but also on 
when a mag-
netic field is applied—hence the name “magnetic quantum number.”
