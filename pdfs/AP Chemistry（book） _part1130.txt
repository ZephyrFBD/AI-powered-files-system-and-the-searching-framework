 the Elements
Recall that the most common ion of oxygen is the oxide ion, O2 -. We would 
therefore expect that the reaction of an alkali metal with oxygen would produce 
the corresponding metal oxide. Indeed, reaction of Li metal with oxygen does form 
lithium oxide:
 
4 Li1s2 + O21g2 ยก 2 Li2O1s2 
[7.19]
When dissolved in water, Li2O and other soluble metal oxides form hydroxide ions from 
the reaction of O2 -  ions with H2O (Equation 7.10).
The reactions of the other alkali metals with oxygen are more complex than we 
would anticipate. For example, when sodium reacts with oxygen, the main product is 
sodium peroxide, which contains the O2
2- ion:
 
2 Na1s2 + O21g2 ยก Na2O21s2 
[7.20]
Potassium, rubidium, and cesium react with oxygen to form compounds that con-
tain the O2
- ion, which we call the superoxide ion. For example, potassium forms potas-
sium superoxide, KO2:
 
K1s2 + O21g2 ยก KO21s2 
[7.21]
Be aware that the reactions in Equations 7.20 and 7.21 are somewhat unexpected; in mo
