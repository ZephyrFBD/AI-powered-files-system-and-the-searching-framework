aphase. The cells are arrested in metaphase as
indicated by the alignment of the chromosomes in the center of the cell and their attachment to spindle
fibers, eliminating (A) and (D). The chromosomes still seem to be attached to the fibers, so there doesnâ€™t
appear to be dissociation of the fibers, eliminating (B).
2.
C
The synthesis, or S phase, of the cell cycle represents the step in which the genetic material is duplicated.
The only phase labeled in the experiment that represents an increase is phase B. Based on the time scale
on the x-axis, this phase lasts approximately 30 minutes.
3.
D
Anaphase represents the cell division stage of the cell cycle and would be the phase that occurs right
before the amount of genetic material should decrease. Phase D is the phase right before the genetic
material would drop, so (D) is the correct answer.
4.
D
Choices (A) and (B) do not occur, but if they did, they would not impact the gametes. Choice (C) is not
likely to occur because the mitotic s
