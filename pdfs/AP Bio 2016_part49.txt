SB = both salmon and bears present. 
Pacific salmon and black bears have often been cited as examples of keystone species. Pacific salmon spawn  
in freshwater streams but spend most of their lives at sea. When mature salmon return to the freshwater streams  
to spawn, they are preyed upon by bears and other predators. When salmon migrate from their marine habitat to  
the freshwater streams, they bring nitrogen and other marine-derived nutrients that subsequently remain in the areas 
surrounding the streams—a process called nitrogen influx. 
In an investigation, the relationship between black bears, salmon, and influx of marine nitrogen into the area 
around a southwestern Alaskan stream was studied. The investigators established several test plots of the same size 
along the stream with the fol
