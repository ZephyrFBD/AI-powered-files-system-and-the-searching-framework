 system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at
the stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter
opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents
of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true
sphincter, but the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action. Acid reflux or “heartburn” occurs when
the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.

Stomach
A large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown in Figure 25.11. The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric
digestive juices. The pH in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5. This highly acidic environment is required for the chemical
breakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients. When empty, the stomach is a rathe
