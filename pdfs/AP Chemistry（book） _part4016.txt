 halogens have large ionization energies. The rela-
tively large effective nuclear charge experienced by np electrons of the 
halogens is similar to the unshielded nuclear charge experienced by 
the H 1s electron. For the alkali metals, the ns electron being removed 
is effectively shielded by the core electrons, so ionization energies 
are low. (d) ionization energy of hydride, H-(g) ¡  H(g) + 1e-  
(e) electron affinity of hydrogen, H(g) + 1 e- ¡  H-(g). The 
value for the ionization energy of hydride is equal in magni-
tude but opposite in sign to the electron affinity of hydro-
gen. 7.102 The most likely product is (i). 7.107 Electron
