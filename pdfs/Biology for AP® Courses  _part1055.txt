nzymes.
Inside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades. For example,
phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called
dephosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into AMP by phosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is
reversed by the Ca2+ pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell.
Activity
Explain the mechanism by which a specific disease is caused by a defective signaling pathway. Then,
investigate online how a specific drug works by blocking a signaling pathway.
9.4 | Signaling in Single-Celled Organisms
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How do single-celled yeasts use cell signaling to communicate with each other?
•
How does quorum sensing allow some bacteria to form biofilms?
