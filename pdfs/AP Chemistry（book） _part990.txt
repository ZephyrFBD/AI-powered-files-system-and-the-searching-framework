hree 6p orbitals singly, with their spins parallel. Thus, there are 
three unpaired electrons in the bismuth atom.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A certain atom has a 3noble gas45s24d105p4 electron configu-
ration. Which element is it?
(a) Cd (b) Te (c) Sm (d) Hg (e) More information is needed
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use the periodic table to write the condensed electron config-
uration for (a) Co (element 27), (b) In (element 49).
As we move beyond the s block, from element 56 to ele-
ment 57, the curved arrow below the periodic table reminds 
us that we are entering the f  block. The first row of the f  block 
corresponds to the 4f subshell. As we move across this block, 
we add 14 electrons: 4f 14.
With element 71, we move into the third row of the d 
block. Because the first row of the d block is 3d, the second 
row is 4d and the third row is 5d. Thus, as we move through 
the ten elements of the d block, from element 71 to element 
80, we fill the 5d subshell with ten electrons: 5d10.
