o as to show which ligands are in the coor-
dination sphere of the metal. By way of example, the molar 
conductances of 0.050 M NaCl and BaCl2 are 107 ohm-1 
and 197 ohm-1, respectively.

inverse of resistance.
 23.70  (a) A compound with formula RuCl3 # 5 H2O is dissolved in 
water, forming a solution that is approximately the same 
color as the solid. Immediately after forming the solution, 
the addition of excess AgNO3(aq) forms 2 mol of solid AgCl 
per mole of complex. Write the formula for the compound, 
showing which ligands are likely to be present in the coor-
dination sphere. (b) After a solution of RuCl3 # 5 H2O has 
stood for about a year, addition of AgNO3(aq) precipitates 3 
mol of AgCl per mole of complex. What has happened in 
the ensuing time?
