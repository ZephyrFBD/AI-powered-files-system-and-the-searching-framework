The processes responsible for the increase in solubility of PbF2 in acidic solution are 
illustrated in Figure 17.18(a).
Other salts that contain basic anions, such as CO3
2 -, PO4
3 -, CN-, or S2 -, behave 
similarly. These examples illustrate a general rule: The solubility of slightly soluble salts con-
taining basic anions increases as 3H+4 increases (as pH is lowered). The more basic the anion, 
the more the solubility is influenced by pH. The solubility of salts with anions of negli-
gible basicity (the anions of strong acids), such as Cl-, Br-, I-, and NO3
-, is unaffected by 
pH changes, as shown in Figure 17.18(b).
