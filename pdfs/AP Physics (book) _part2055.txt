 19–3a will also pass through 
and then 
Hence the
same current I passes through each resistor. (If it did not, this would imply that
either charge was not conserved, or that charge was accumulating at some point
in the circuit, which does not happen in the steady state.)
We let V represent the potential difference (voltage) across all three resistors
in Fig. 19–3a. We assume all other resistance in the circuit can be ignored, so V
equals the terminal voltage supplied by the battery. We let 
and 
be the
potential differences across each of the resistors,
and 
respectively.
From Ohm’s law,
we can write 
and 
Because the resistors are connected end to end, energy conservation tells us that
the total voltage V is equal to the sum of the voltages across each resistor:
[series] (19;2)
Now let us determine the equivalent single resistance 
that would draw
the same current I as our combination of three resistors in series; see Fig. 19–3c.
Such a single resistance 
would be related to V by
We
