s and
that, along with vessel elements, make up xylem in a plant.
Tracheophytes Plants that have transport vessels, xylem and phloem.
Transcription The process by which DNA makes RNA.
Transduction Transfer of bacterial DNA by phages from one bacterium to
another.
Transformation The transfer of genes from one bacterium into another.
Translation The process by which the codons of an mRNA sequence are
changed into an amino acid sequence.
Translocation A chromosome mutation in which a fragment of a
chromosome becomes attached to a nonhomologous chromosome; the
transport of sugar in a plant from source to sink.
Transpiration Loss of water from stomates in leaves.
Transpirational pullâ€“cohesion tension theory This theory describes the
passive transport of water up a tree. For each molecule of water that
evaporates from a leaf by transpiration, another molecule of water is
drawn in at the root to replace it.
Transposons Transposable genetic elements, sometimes called jumping
genes.
