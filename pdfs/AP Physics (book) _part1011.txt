79. In a mountain-climbing technique called the “Tyrolean tra-
verse,” a rope is anchored on both ends (to rocks or strong
trees) across a deep chasm, and then a climber traverses the
rope while attached by a sling as in Fig. 9–91. This technique
generates tremendous forces in the rope and anchors, so a
basic understanding of physics is crucial for safety. A typical
climbing rope can undergo a tension force of perhaps 29 kN
before breaking, and a “safety factor”of 10 is usually recom-
mended. The length of rope used in the Tyrolean traverse
must allow for some “sag” to remain in the recommended
safety range. Consider a 75-kg climber at the center of a
Tyrolean traverse, spanning a 25-m chasm. (a) To be within its
recommended safety range, what minimum distance x must
