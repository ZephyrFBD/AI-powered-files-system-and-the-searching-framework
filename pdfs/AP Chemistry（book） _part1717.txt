 of each molecule close to the positively charged ¬CH3 
ends of its neighbors. In the liquid [Figure 11.7(b)], the molecules are free to move with 
respect to one another, and their arrangement becomes more disordered. This means 
that, at any given instant, both attractive and repulsive dipole–dipole interactions are 
present. However, not only are there more attractive interactions than repulsive ones, but 
also molecules that are attracting each other spend more time near each other than do 
molecules that are repelling each other. The overall effect is a net attraction strong enough 
to keep the molecules in liquid CH3CN from moving apart to form a gas.
For molecules of approximately equal mass and size, the strength of intermolecular attrac-
tions increases with increasing polarity, a trend we see in Figure 11.8. Notice how the boiling 
point increases as the dipole moment increases.
