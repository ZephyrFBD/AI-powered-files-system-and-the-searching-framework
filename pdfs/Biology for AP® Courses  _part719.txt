portant to
remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state at the completion of the reaction. One of the hallmark
properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme is done
catalyzing a reaction, it releases its product(s).
Figure 6.16 According to the induced-fit model, both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic conformational changes
upon binding. The enzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.

AP Biology Investigation 13: Enzyme Activity. This investigation allows you to design and conduct experiments to
explore the effects of environmental variables, such as temperature and pH, on the rates of enzymatic reactions.
Control of Metabolism Through Enzyme Regulation
It would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of the enzymes encoded
