 called the
pulmonary circuit. The circulation pathway throughout the body (between the left and right sides of the heart) is
called the systemic circuit. Note that in the systemic circuit, oxygenated blood is transported in arteries and
deoxygenated blood is transported in veins, while in the pulmonary circuit, it is reversed.
The cardiac cycle (or heart cycle) refers to the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of heart muscles. The process is
regulated by specialized tissues in the heart called autorhythmic cells, which are self-excitable and able to initiate
contractions without external stimulation by nerve cells. The cycle occurs as follows:
1. The SA (sinoatrial) node, or pacemaker, located in the upper wall of the right atrium, spontaneously initiates the
cycle by simultaneously contracting both atria and also by sending an impulse that stimulates the AV
(atrioventricular) node.
2. After a short delay, the AV node in the lower wall of the right atrium sends an impulse through the
