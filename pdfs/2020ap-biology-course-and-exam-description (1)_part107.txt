quences of a

organismal, and ecosystem level.
 
Preparing for the AP Exam 
Students often lack an understanding of 
metabolic pathways, confusing them with 
other processes. Students should know 
inputs and outputs of metabolic pathways, 
predict how changes in reactants affect 
them, and explain how organisms and 
ecosystems are affected by changes.
Common misconceptions include: only 
animals conduct cellular respiration, oxygen 
is created during photosynthesis, and only 
plants conduct photosynthesis. Be sure 
to make clear the distinction between 
memorizing molecules and demonstrating 
an understanding of how molecular events 
connect to overall function of organisms 
and to carbon transfer within ecosystems. 
Students should have an understanding 
of cellular respiration and photosynthesis 
to predict and justify the effect of 
environmental changes on those processes. 
Students may be required to graph data 
from an experimentâ€”using
