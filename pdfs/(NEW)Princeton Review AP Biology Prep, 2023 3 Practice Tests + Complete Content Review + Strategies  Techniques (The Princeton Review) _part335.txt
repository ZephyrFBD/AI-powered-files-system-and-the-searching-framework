During DNA replication, one DNA strand is called the leading strand, and it is made continuously. That is, the
nucleotides are steadily added one after the other by DNA polymerase. The other strand—the lagging strand—is
made discontinuously. Unlike the leading strand, the lagging strand is made in pieces of nucleotides known as
Okazaki fragments. Why is the lagging strand made in small pieces?
Nucleotides are added only in the 5′ to 3′ direction since nucleotides can be added only to the 3′ end of the growing
chain. However, when the double-helix is “unzipped,” one of the two strands is oriented in the opposite direction—
3′ to 5′. Because DNA polymerase doesn’t work in this direction, the strand needs to be built in pieces. You can see
in the figure below that the leading strand is being created toward the opening of the helix and the helix continually
opens ahead of it to accommodate it. The lagging strand is built in the opposite direction of the w
