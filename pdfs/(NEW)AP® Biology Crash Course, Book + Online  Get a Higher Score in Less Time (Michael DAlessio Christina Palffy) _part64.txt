sion of the cytoplasm following mitosis whereby the two newly formed nuclei
become incorporated into separate cells.
1. In animal cells, a special collection of microfilaments of the cytoskeleton form a cleavage furrow in
the center of the cell, which causes the cell to be pinched into two cells.
2. In plant cells, vesicles from the Golgi apparatus form a cell plate in the center of the cell along which
new cell wall material is deposited between the two newly forming plasma membranes.

Regulation of the Cell Cycle
A. The cell cycle is regulated to help prevent the production of abnormal cells that could eventually become
cancerous.
B. Some Ways That the Cell Cycle Is Regulated
1. Checkpoints—essential points during the cell cycle that regulate the process of passing from one stage
to the next.
2. G0 phase—a nondividing stage of the cell cycle that halts the cycle from proceeding.
3. Growth factor—protein/hormone that promotes the division of cel
