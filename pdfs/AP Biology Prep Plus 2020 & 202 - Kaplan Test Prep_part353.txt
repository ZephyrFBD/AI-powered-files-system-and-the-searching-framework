Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to the allosteric
site, inducing a conformation change in the enzyme, rendering the active
site inactive. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome by adding more
substrate because the enzyme’s shape has been altered. Therefore,
noncompetitive inhibition may or may not be irreversible. Keep in mind
that enzymes do not alter reaction equilibrium or aﬀect the free energy of
a reaction. They accelerate the forward and reverse reactions by the same
factor.
Feedback inhibition occurs when the end product of an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction works to block the activity of the enzymes that started the
reaction in the first place. (This is an example of negative feedback, as
distinct from positive feedback, which amplifies a particular bodily
response.) In the following diagram, feedback inhibition would occur if
product C could bind to the active site of enzyme 1 (this would be a kind
of competitive inhibition), thereby preventing a
