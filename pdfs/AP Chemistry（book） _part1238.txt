 the Ger-
man scientists Max Born (1882–1970) and Fritz Haber (1868–1934), 
who introduced it to analyze the factors contributing to the stability 
of ionic compounds.
Let’s use NaCl as an example. In Equation 8.3, which defines lattice 
energy, NaCl(s) is the reactant, and the gas-phase ions Na+1g2 and Cl-1g2 
are the products. This equation is our target as we apply Hess’s Law.
In seeking a set of other equations that can be added up to give 
our target equation, we can use the heat of formation for NaCl 
  
(Section 5.7):
 
Na1s2 + 1
2 Cl21g2 ¡ NaCl1s2  ∆H°
f 3NaCl1s24 = -411 kJ [8.5]
Of course, we will have to turn this equation around so that we have 
NaCl(s) as the reactant as we do in the equation for the lattice energy. 
We can use two other equations to arrive at our target, as shown below:
1. NaCl1s2 ¡ Na1s2+ 1
2 Cl21g2    
∆H1 = - ∆Hf° 3NaCl1s24 
= +411 kJ
2. Na1s2 ¡ Na+1g2 + e- 
∆H2 = ??
3. e- + 1
2 Cl21g2 ¡ Cl-1g2 
∆H3 = ???
4. NaCl1s2 ¡ Na+1g2 + Cl-1g2 
∆H4 = ∆H1 + ∆H2 +
