(b) The terminal voltage of the battery is
(c) Now we can work back and get the current in the 
resistor. It must be
the same as the current through the 
shown in Fig. 19–10c (why?). The
voltage across that 
will be the emf of the battery minus the voltage 
drops across r and the 
resistor:
Applying Ohm’s law, we get the current (call it 
)
This is the current through the 
resistor.
19–3 Kirchhoff’s Rules
In the last few Examples we have been able to find the currents in circuits by com-
bining resistances in series and parallel, and using Ohm’s law. This technique can
be used for many circuits. However, some circuits are too complicated for that
analysis. For example, we cannot find the currents in each part of the circuit shown
in Fig. 19–11 simply by combining resistances as we did before.
To deal with complicated circuits, we use Kirchhoff’s rules, devised by G. R.
Kirchhoff (1824–1887) in the mid-nineteenth century. There are two rules, and they
are simply convenient applicati
