t cellular respiration, they release CO2, which makes the
blood more acidic. The blood pH changes from normal 7.4 to the
more acidic 7.2. At pH 7.2, the Hb can release more of its oxygen
where it is needed, at the cells.
(B) The Law of Independent Assortment states that, during gamete
formation, the alleles for a gene for a trait, such as height (Tt),
segregate independently (randomly) from the alleles for a gene for
another trait, such as seed color. Choice A is incorrect because the
number of gametes will not increase; the variety of gametes will
increase. Choice C is incorrect because the number of offspring is
not related to the types of gametes. Choice D is incorrect because
the variety of gametes will increase, not decrease.
(C) Although it is true that during the Krebs cycle pyruvate is
completely broken down into CO2, the most energy from cellular
respiration is released during oxidative phosphorylation, when all
the energy stored in NADH and FADH2 from previous stages of
cellu
