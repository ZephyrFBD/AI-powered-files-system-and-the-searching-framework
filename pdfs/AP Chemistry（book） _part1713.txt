▲ Figure 11.5 Boiling points of the halogens and noble gases. This plot shows how the boiling 
points increase due to stronger dispersion forces as the atomic/molecular weight increases.
Give It Some Thought
List the substances CCl4, CBr4, and CH4 in order of increasing boiling point.
in the boiling points of the halogens and noble gases (Figure 11.5), where dispersion forces 
are the only intermolecular forces at work. In both families the atomic/molecular weight 
increases on moving down the periodic table. The higher atomic/molecular weights trans-
