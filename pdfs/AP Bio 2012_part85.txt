ntific questions 
based on hypotheses about the origin of life on Earth.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The Miller experiment did not model the formation  
of Earth but rather attempted to model the evolution of biological molecules  
on Earth.
(B)
This option is incorrect. The Miller experiment did not model the conditions on 
comets or meteorites but rather attempted to model the evolution of biological 
molecules on Earth.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates the ability to evaluate scientific 
questions about the origin of life on Earth by recognizing that the Miller 
experiment modeled the presumed early atmospheric conditions and, under 
laboratory conditions, produced biological molecules, such as amino acids, 
that were required for early life.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The molecules formed in the Miller experiment were  
not proteins.
