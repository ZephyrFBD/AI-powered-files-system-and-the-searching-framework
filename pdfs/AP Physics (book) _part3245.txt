molecules “translate” the genetic code of nucleotide bases into amino acids in 
the following way. There is a different t-RNA molecule for each amino acid and
each combination of three bases. On one end of a t-RNA molecule is an amino
acid. On the other end of the t-RNA molecule is the appropriate “anticodon,”
a set of three nucleotide bases that “code” for that amino acid. If all three 
bases of an anticodon match the three bases of the “codon” on the m-RNA (in
the sense of G to C and A to U), the anticodon is attracted electrostatically 
to the m-RNA codon and that t-RNA molecule is held there briefly. The

ribosome has two particular attachment sites which hold two t-RNA molecules
while enzymes bond the two amino acids together to lengthen the amino acid
chain (yellow in Fig. 29–13). As each amino acid is connected by an enzyme
