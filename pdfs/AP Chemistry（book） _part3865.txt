nd so depend on plant photosynthesis to supply the bulk 
of their energy needs. 
 (Section 23.3)
In addition to requiring large amounts of energy, living organisms are highly orga-
nized. In thermodynamic terms, this high degree of organization means that the entropy 
of living systems is much lower than that of the raw materials from which the systems 
formed. Thus, living systems must continuously work against the spontaneous tendency 
toward increased entropy. 
 (Section 19.3)
In the “Chemistry and Life” essays that appear throughout this text, we have intro-
duced some important biochemical applications of fundamental chemical ideas. The 
remainder of this chapter will serve as only a brief introduction to other aspects of bio-
chemistry. Nevertheless, you will see some patterns emerging. Hydrogen bonding, 
 
 (Section 1
1.2), for example, is critical to the function of many biochemical systems, and 
the geometry of molecules 
 (Section 9.1) can govern their biological importance a
