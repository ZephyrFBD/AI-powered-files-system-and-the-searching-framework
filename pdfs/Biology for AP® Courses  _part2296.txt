a.
Phylogenetic trees are based on evolutionary
connections, so scientists can use the analogous
characteristics to build the phylogenetic trees.
b.
Phylogenetic trees are based on evolutionary
connections, so scientists can use the
homologous characteristics to build the
phylogenetic trees.
c.
Phylogenetic trees are based on similar
functions, so scientists can use the homologous
characteristics to build the phylogenetic trees.
d.
Phylogenetic trees are based on similar
functions, so scientists can use the homologous
characteristics to build the phylogenetic trees.
13. Describe an analogous structure.
a.
A penguin and a seagull both have wings. The
penguin uses wings to swim while the seagull
uses wings to fly.
b.
Lizards and whales have similar skeleton
structures, but they have a different habitat and
lifestyle.
c.
Birds and butterflies have wings with similar
characteristics for flight even though their wings
do not share an evolutionary relationship.
