erozygotes is 2pq = 2(0.553)(0.447) =
0.494. If the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the allele frequencies will not change, so the
frequency of the heterozygotes will still be 0.494 after three generations.
10. (B) An appropriate control for an experiment investigating the effects of different salt concentrations would
keep the same starting concentration of the substrate, the same pH and temperature conditions but would not
include salt. Choice (A) is incorrect because using a different salt (with possibly different properties) would
confound the results of the experiment. Changing the temperature could affect the results, so choice (C) would
not be an appropriate control. Replacing the enzyme solution with water would be an appropriate control for
studying the effects of enzyme concentration but would not be an appropriate control for studying the effects of
salt concentrations, so choice (D) is incorrect.
