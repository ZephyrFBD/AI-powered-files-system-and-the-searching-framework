†Even nuclear power plants utilize steam turbines; the nuclear fuel—uranium—serves as fuel to heat
the steam.

FIGURE 15–13 Four-stroke-cycle internal combustion engine: (a) the gasoline–air
mixture flows into the cylinder as the piston moves down; (b) the piston moves upward 
and compresses the gas; (c) the brief instant when firing of the spark plug ignites the 
highly compressed gasoline–air mixture, raising it to a high temperature; (d) the gases, now 
at high temperature and pressure, expand against the piston in this, the power stroke;
(e) the burned gases are pushed out to the exhaust pipe. When the piston reaches the top,
