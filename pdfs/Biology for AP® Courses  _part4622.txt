rganic and inorganic nutrients are subdivided into those that are bioavailable
(ready to be incorporated into biological macromolecules) and those that are not. For example, in a terrestrial ecosystem
near a deposit of coal, carbon will be available to the plants of this ecosystem as carbon dioxide gas in a short-term
period, not from the carbon-rich coal itself. However, over a longer period, microorganisms capable of digesting coal will
incorporate its carbon or release it as natural gas (methane, CH4), changing this unavailable organic source into an available
one. This conversion is greatly accelerated by the combustion of fossil fuels by humans, which releases large amounts of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is thought to be a major factor in the rise of the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
in the industrial age. The carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is produced faster than photosynthetic organisms
can use it. This process is intensified by the reduction
