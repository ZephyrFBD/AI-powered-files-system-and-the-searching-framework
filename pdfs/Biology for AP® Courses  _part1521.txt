and observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells
grown exclusively in 15N and 14N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA
harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position
between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA
replicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.
During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands
are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. When two daughter DNA copies are
formed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.
