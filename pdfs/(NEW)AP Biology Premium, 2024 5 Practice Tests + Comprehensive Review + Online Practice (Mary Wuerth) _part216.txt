 the intermembrane space can be 1,000
times that of the matrix!
At the end of the electron transport chain, molecular oxygen (O2) combines with four protons (H+) and four
electrons (eâ€“) to form two water molecules. This makes oxygen the final, or terminal, electron acceptor during
cellular respiration.

The proton gradient created by the electron transport chain is used to drive ATP synthesis. Using a proton
gradient to drive the production of ATP is called chemiosmosis, as shown in Figure 9.5. The enzyme ATP synthase
catalyzes this process. ATP synthase is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Protons flow from an
area of higher concentration in the intermembrane space to an area of lower concentration in the matrix through a
channel in the ATP synthase enzyme. This flow of protons down their concentration gradient through ATP synthase
causes a shape change in the enzyme. This change in shape allows ATP synthase to catalyze the productio
