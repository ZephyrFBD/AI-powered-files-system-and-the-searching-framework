identally
takes up bacterial DNA from its host before infecting another
closely-related bacterium via transduction.

7. Horizontal gene transfer between bacteria can occur through
several mechanistic pathways as shown in the diagram below.
How does pathway 2 diï¬€er from pathway 3?
Pathway 2 is transformation and involves the exchange of
DNA using bacteriophages, whereas pathway 3 is conjugation
and involves the transfer of genetic material using a pilus.
(A)
Pathway 3 is transduction and involves the exchange of
genetic material using bacteriophages, whereas pathway 2 is
conjugation and involves the transfer of genetic material
using a pilus.
(B)
Pathway 2 is transduction and involves the exchange of
genetic material using a pilus, whereas pathway 3 is
conjugation and involves the transfer of genetic material
using bacteriophages.
(C)
Pathway 2 is transduction and involves the exchange of
genetic material using bacteriophages, whereas pathway 3 is
conjugation and involves the transfe
