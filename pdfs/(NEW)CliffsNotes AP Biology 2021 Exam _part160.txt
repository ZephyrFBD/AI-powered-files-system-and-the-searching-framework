You should recognize that no light is directly used in the Calvin cycle. Thus, these reactions are often called the
light-independent reactions or even the dark reactions. But be careful—the Calvin cycle occurs in the presence of
light. This is because it is dependent upon the energy from ATP and NADPH, and these two energy-rich molecules
can be created only during photophosphorylation, which can occur only in light.
In summary, the Calvin cycle takes CO2from the atmosphere and the
energy in ATP and NADPH to create a glucose molecule. Of course, the energy in ATP and NADPH represents
energy from the sun captured during photophosphorylation. The Calvin cycle can be informally summarized as
follows:
6 CO2+ 18 ATP + 12 NADPH → 18 ADP + 12 NADP+ + 1 glucose
Chloroplasts
Chloroplasts are the sites where both the light-dependent and lightindependent reactions of photosynthesis occur.
Chloroplasts consist of the following areas (Figure 5-2):
