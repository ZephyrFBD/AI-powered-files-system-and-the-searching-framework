ed. This answer reflects the claim 
that the student can analyze the data to identify how molecular interactions 
(H+ and myoglobin) affect function (binding of O2).
(B)
This option is incorrect because an increase in binding sites would increase, not 
decrease, binding.
(C)
This option is incorrect because the capture of more oxygen would increase, not 
decrease, binding. The curve would not be shifted to the right.
(D)
This option is incorrect because the capture of more oxygen would increase, not 
decrease, binding. The curve would not be shifted to the right.
Question 53
Essential Knowledge
4.B.1: Interactions between molecules affect their 
structure and function.
Science Practice
5.1: The student can analyze data to identify patterns  
or relationships.
Learning Objective 
4.17: The student is able to analyze data to identify how 
molecular interactions affect structure and function.
(A)
This option is incorrect. The higher affinity of myoglobin for oxygen would not 
prevent oxyg
