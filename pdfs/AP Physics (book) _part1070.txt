10–10 Applications of Bernoulli’s Principle:
Torricelli, Airplanes, Baseballs, Blood Flow
Bernoulli’s equation can be applied to many situations. One example is to calculate
the velocity,
of a liquid flowing out of a spigot at the bottom of a reservoir,
Fig. 10–23. We choose point 2 in Eq. 10–5 to be the top surface of the liquid.
Assuming the diameter of the reservoir is large compared to that of the spigot,
will be almost zero. Points 1 (the spigot) and 2 (top surface) are open to the
atmosphere, so the pressure at both points is equa
