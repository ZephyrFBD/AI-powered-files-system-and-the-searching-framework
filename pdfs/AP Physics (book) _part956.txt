ts dimensions. That is, the constant k in Eq. 9–3 can be written in
terms of these factors.
If we compare rods made of the same material but of different lengths and
cross-sectional areas, it is found that for the same applied force, the amount of
stretch (again assumed small compared to the total length) is proportional to the
original length and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. That is,
the longer the object, the more it elongates for a given force; and the thicker it is,
the less it elongates. These findings can be combined with Eq. 9–3 to yield
(9;4)
where 
is the original length of the object, A is the cross-sectional area, and 
is the
change in length due to the applied force F. E is a constant of proportionality‡ known
as the elastic modulus, or Young’s modulus; its value depends only on the material.
