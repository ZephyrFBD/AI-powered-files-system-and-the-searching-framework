ology is the study of how populations change. Whether these changes are long-term or short-term,
predictable or unpredictable, we’re talking about the growth and distribution patterns of a population.
When studying a population, you need to examine four things: the size (the total number of individuals), the density
(the number of individuals per area), the distribution patterns (how individuals in a population are spread out), and
the age structure.
For example, the graph below shows there is a high death rate among the young of oysters, but those that survive do
well. On the other hand, there is a low death rate among the young of humans, but, after age 60, the death rate is
high.
Population growth can be represented as the number of births minus the number of deaths divided by the size of
the population.
r = (births – deaths)/N
(r is the reproductive rate, and N is the population size.)
Population growth can also be calculated in the following way:
Each population has a carrying cap
