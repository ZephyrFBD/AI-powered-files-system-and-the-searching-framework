DIFFUSION AND OSMOSIS
What causes my plants to wilt if I forget to  
water them?
â–  BACKGROUND
Cells must move materials through membranes and throughout cytoplasm in order 
to maintain homeostasis. The movement is regulated because cellular membranes, 
including the plasma and organelle membranes, are selectively permeable. Membranes 
are phospholipid bilayers containing embedded proteins; the phospholipid fatty acids 
limit the movement of
