he efficiency of the strategy, so the smaller the index is,
the more efficient the strategy is. Due to the different properties the index show, we
should choose different functions that best fit the character of the index to process the
data. Owing to the monotonous negative impact, we establish an extreme membership
function to transfer the data into an index that belongs to [0, 1].
For example, the upper limit of wasting water is
0
Q and the lower limit of wasting
water is zero, so we assign M the value of zero. Then we use the extreme model to
process the data to calculate the final index that shows the level of wasting water,
which belongs to [0, 1].
