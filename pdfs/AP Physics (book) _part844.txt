re rolls without slipping, we have
(recall Fig. 8–8). Hence
Canceling the M’s and R’s, we obtain
or
[rolling sphere]
We can compare this result for the speed of a rolling sphere to that for an object
sliding down a plane without rotating and without friction,
(see
our energy conservation equation above, removing the rotational term). For the
sliding object,
which is greater than our result for a rolling sphere
An object sliding without friction or rotation transforms its initial
potential energy entirely into translational kinetic energy (none into rotational
kinetic energy), so the speed of its center of mass is greater.
NOTE Our result for the rolling sphere shows (perhaps surprisingly) that v is
independent of both the mass M and the radius R of the sphere.
