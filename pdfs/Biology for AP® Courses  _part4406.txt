section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 and Big Idea 4 of
the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
