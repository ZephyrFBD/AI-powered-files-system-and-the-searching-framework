Primary productivity is a rate — energy captured by photosynthetic organisms in a 
given area per unit of time. Based on the second law of thermodynamics, when energy is 
converted from one form to another, some energy will be lost as heat. When light energy 
is converted to chemical energy in photosynthesis or transferred from one organism (a 
plant or producer) to its consumer (e.g., an herbivorous insect), some energy will be lost 
as heat during each transfer. 
In terrestrial ecosystems, productivity (or energy capture) is generally estimated by 
the change in biomass of plants produced over a specific time period. Measuring biomass 
or changes in biomass is relatively straightforward: simply mass the organism(s) on an 
appropriate scale and record the mass over various time intervals. The complicating 
factor is that a large percentage of the mass of a living organism is water — not the 
energy-rich organic compounds of biomass. Therefore, to determine the biomass at a
