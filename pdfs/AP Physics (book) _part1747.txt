es of the forces, we omitted the signs of
the charges. But we must be aware of them to get the direction of each force.
Let the line joining the particles be the x axis, and we take it positive to the right.
Then, because 
is repulsive and 
is attractive, the directions of the forces
are as shown in Fig. 16–19b:
points in the positive x direction (away from 
)
and 
points in the negative x direction (toward 
). The net force on 
particle 3 is then
The magnitude of the net force is 1.5 N, and it points to the left.
NOTE Charge 
acts on charge 
just as if 
were not there (this is the 
principle of superposition). That is, the charge in the middle,
in no way
blocks the effect of charge 
acting on
