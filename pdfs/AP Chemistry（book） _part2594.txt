ted in this way increases the pH of the solution, making it basic. 
Acetate ion, for example, being the conjugate base of a weak acid, reacts with water to 
produce acetic acid and hydroxide ions, thereby increasing the pH of the solution:
 
CH3COO-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ CH3COOH1aq2 + OH -1aq2 
[16.44]
Give It Some Thought
Will NO3
- ions affect the pH of a solution? What about CO3
2- ions?
The situation is more complicated for salts containing anions that have ionizable 
protons, such as HSO3
-. These salts are amphiprotic (Section 16.2), and how they behave 
in water is determined by the relative magnitudes of Ka and Kb for the ion, as shown in 
Sample Exercise 16.19. If Ka 7 Kb, the ion causes the solution to be acidic. If Kb 7 Ka, the 
solution is made basic by the ion.
A Cation’s Ability to React with Water
Polyatomic cations containing one or more protons can be considered the conjugate 
acids of weak bases. The NH4
+ ion, for example, is the conjugate acid of the weak base 
NH3. Thus,
