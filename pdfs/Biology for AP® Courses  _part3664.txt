41. Oxygen deprivation produces symptoms such as
fatigue, headaches, and confusion that are collectively
referred to as hypoxia. A vacation in the Rocky Mountains
of the US, where the partial pressure of oxygen is just 15%
lower than you are accustomed to on the coast, can induce
these symptoms. The body has a very narrow range of
environment oxygen tolerance. It essentially has no
capacity for storage of oxygen that is continuously
consumed to maintain energy homeostasis.
The response to oxygen deprivation is to increase
breathing rate and increase the volume of each breath. The
input for a negative feedback loop that maintains
homeostasis by detecting oxygen concentrations is a
sensor (the carotid body) located on the interior of carotid
artery. Th
