ter, which promotes solubility.  
page 538 230 ppm (1 ppm is 1 part in106); 2.30 * 105 ppb (1 ppb 
is 1 part in 109). page 540 For dilute aqueous solutions the molal-
ity will be nearly equal to the molarity. Molality is the number of 
moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, whereas molarity is the 
number moles of solute per liter of solution. Because the solution 
is dilute, the mass of solvent is essentially equal to the mass of the 
solution. Furthermore, a dilute aqueous solution will have a density 
of 1.0 kg>L. Thus, the number of liters of solution and the number of 
kilograms of solvent will be essentially equal. page 543 A greater 
extent, lowering of the vapor pressure depends on the total solute 
concentration (Equation 13.11). One mole of NaCl (a strong electro-
lyte) provides 2 mol of particles (1 mol of Na+ and 1 mol Cl), whereas 
one mole of (a nonelectrolyte) provides only 1 mol particles.

lyte, it
