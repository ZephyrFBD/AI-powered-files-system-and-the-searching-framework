embryonic development. Certain cells must be removed in order for
others to develop properly. An example is the reabsorption of a
tadpole’s tail during morphogenesis. The tail is resorbed, and legs
develop. The topic of apoptosis is also important in the study of
Biology because it connects with two other important topics: cell
signaling and gene regulation.
Classic experiments beginning in 1924 proved that the nucleus does
not exert sole control over embryonic development. The cytoplasm
also plays an important role. Hans Spemann established that the
dorsal lip from an amphibian embryo is an organizer and can

cells with which it comes in contact. This process is known as
embryonic induction.
Homeotic or Hox genes are master regulatory genes that control
the expression of genes that regulate the p
