rvive. When the
algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are
then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent
freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.

Rivers and Streams
Rivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source, or
headwater, to a lake or ocean. The largest rivers include the Nile River in Africa, the Amazon River in South America, and
the Mississippi River in North America.
Abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. Streams begin at a point of origin referred
to as source water. The source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and cl
