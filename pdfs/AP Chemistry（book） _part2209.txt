The Change of Concentration 
with Time
The rate laws we have examined so far enable us to calculate the rate of a reaction from 
the rate constant and reactant concentrations. In this section, we will show that rate 
laws can also be converted into equations that show the relationship between concen-
trations of reactants or products and time. The mathematics required to accomplish this 
conversion involves calculus. We do not expect you to be able to perform the calculus 
operations, but you should be able to use the resulting equations. We will apply this con-
version to three of the simplest rate laws: those that are first order overall, those that are 
second order overall, and those that are zero order overall.
First-Order Reactions
A first-order reaction is one whose rate depends on the concentration of a single reactant 
raised to the first power. If a reaction of the type
