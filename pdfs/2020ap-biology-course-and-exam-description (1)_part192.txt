quations, 
be careful to distinguish between allele and 
genotype frequencies. The Hardy-Weinberg 
principle clarifies the factors that alter allele 
frequency, but it does not imply that allele 
frequencies are static. This is an important 
understanding that students need in order 
to make predictions about a change in a 
population and to justify the reasoning for 
their predictions.
Preparing for the AP Exam 
The principle of natural selection and its 
components appears throughout the course. 
It is important that students are precise in 
the language they use when writing about 
evolution, being careful to avoid writing 
statements that are Lamarckian. A common 
student error is using buzzwords such as 
“fitness” without proper explanation of 
the underlying concept. Students should 
recall the sources of genetic variation 
learned in Unit 5 in order to demonstrate 
the understanding that genetic variation is 
necessary for natural selection and describe 
its role in reproductive
