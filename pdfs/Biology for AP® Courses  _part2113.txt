Introduction
Evolutionary medicine is an emerging field that applies evolutionary theory to modern medicine. Rather than just seeking
answers to how illness occurs, evolutionary medicine also asks why illness occurs. This approach to medicine has led to
many important advances. For example, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are pieces of retroviruses that began invading
mammalian genomes over 100 million years ago. While studying why smaller
