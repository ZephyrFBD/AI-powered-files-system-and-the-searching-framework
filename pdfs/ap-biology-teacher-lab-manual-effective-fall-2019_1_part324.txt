•  How do these factors alter diffusion rates? 
•  Why are gradients important in diffusion and osmosis? 
•  What is the explanation for the fact that most cells are small and have cell membranes 
with many convolutions? 
•  Will water move into or out of a plant cell if the cell has a higher water potential than 
the surrounding environment? 
•  What would happen if you applied saltwater to a plant? 
•  How does a plant cell control its internal (turgor) pressure? 
■ Procedure 1: Surface Area and Cell Size 
Cell size and shape are important factors in determining the rate of diffusion. Think 
about cells with specialized functions, such as the epithelial cells that line the small 
intestine or plant root hairs. 
•  What is the shape of these cells? 
•  What size are the cells? 
•  How do small intestinal epithelial and
