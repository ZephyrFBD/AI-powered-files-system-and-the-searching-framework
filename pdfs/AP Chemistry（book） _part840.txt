he temperature of the water. Each is then 
lifted out and placed in separate beakers containing 1000 g 
water at 10.0 째C. Object A increases the water temperature 
by 3.50 째C; B increases the water temperature by 2.60 째C.   
(a) Which object has the larger heat capacity? (b) What can 
you say about the specific heats of A and B?

needed to raise the temperature of 10.00 kg of liquid water 
from 24.6 to 46.2 째C?
 5.52 (a) Which substance in Table 5.2 requires the smallest 
amount of energy to increase the temperature of 50.0 g of 
that substance by 10 K? (b) Calculate the energy needed for 
this temperature change.
