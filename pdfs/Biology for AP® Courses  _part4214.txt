Fires, mainly caused by lightning, are a natural disturbance in temperate grasslands. When fire is suppressed in temperate
grasslands, the vegetation eventually converts to scrub and dense forests. Often, the restoration or management of temperate
grasslands requires the use of controlled burns to suppress the growth of trees and maintain the grasses.
Temperate Forests
Temperate forests are the most common biome in eastern North America, Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Chile, and New
Zealand (Figure 35.12). This biome is found throughout mid-latitude regions. Temperatures range between -30 째C and 30
째C (-22 째F to 86 째F) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis. These temperatures mean that temperate forests have
defined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. Precipit
