 source of variation in
humans. Genetic drift and mutations are also an important source of
variation in humans, but they do not provide nearly as much
variation as does recombination of alleles. Changes in the
environment provide pressure for evolution, but they are not a
source for variation.
(D) This was a very successful treatment. The patientâ€™s hemoglobin
(Hb) levels are approaching normal levels. There are no sudden and
severe drops in Hb levels, and the patient no longer requires
transfusions.
(C) Most oyster larvae die from predation, as stated in the
information that precedes the question. Even without any other
information provided, you would have to choose Line C.
(B) Choice B is correct because this life strategy evolved by natural
selection, and the selecting pressure was the harsh environment.
Choice A is not the most likely explanation for this occurrence.
Choices C and D have the theory backward. Mutations may provide
variety in a population, but they do not occur to pr
