In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some materials
diffuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is made possible by specialized proteins,
such as channels and transporters. The chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions, and balancing the
concentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem. In living systems, diffusion of some substances would be slow or
difficult without membrane proteins that facilitate transport.
5.3 Active Transport
The combined gradient that affects an ion includes its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient. A positive ion, for
example, might tend to diffuse into a new area, down its concentration gradient, but if it is diffusing into an area of net
positive charge, its diffusion will be hampered by its elec
