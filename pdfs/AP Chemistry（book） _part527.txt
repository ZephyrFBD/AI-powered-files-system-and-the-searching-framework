ainder used to produce ni-
trogen dioxide, calculate how many grams of nitrogen  
dioxide 
would be produced during the combustion of 500 g of octane.
 3.115 The thermite reaction, 
 
 
Fe2O3 + Al S Al2O3 + Fe 
 
 produces so much heat that the Fe product melts. This re-
action is used industrially to weld metal parts under water, 
where a torch cannot be employed. It is also a favorite chem-
ical demonstration in the lecture hall (on a small scale).
(a) Balance the chemical equation for the thermite reac-
tion, and include the proper states of matter.
(b) Calculate how many grams of aluminum are needed to 
completely react with 500.0 g of Fe2O3 in this reaction.
(c) This reaction produces 852 kJ of heat per mole of Fe2O3 
reacted. How many grams of Fe2O3 are needed to pro-
duce 1.00 * 104 kJ of heat?
(d) If you performed the reverse reaction— aluminum oxide 
plus iron makes iron oxide plus aluminum—would that 
reaction have heat as a reactant or a product?
