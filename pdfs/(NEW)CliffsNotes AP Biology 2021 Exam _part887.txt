48. A. The graph depicts the process of ecological succession, in which one community replaces another over time.
This occurs because species in each community cause changes in the physical or biological aspects of the
environment. For example, changes in soil quality or light availability may make the habitat less suitable for
residence species and more appropriate for new species. Over time, the number and kinds of species (both plants and
animals) increase until a climax community is establishedâ€”a stable community that persists with little change until
damaged by a catastrophic event, such as a fire.
49. A. A sudden and large biomass collapse, as shown in this figure, is most likely due to fire. Disease, storms, or
earthquakes will lead to gradual or selective damage, but not to the sudden disappearance of almost all the biomass.
A devastating fire is capable of incinerating everything but the seeds stored in the ground, although some vegetation
usually escapes the fire if the fi
