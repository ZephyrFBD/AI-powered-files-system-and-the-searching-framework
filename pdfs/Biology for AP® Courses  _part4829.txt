ng allows cataloguing of
an organism using rapid sequencing methods. The choice
of which gene to use for barcoding is guided by its rate of
evolution. Which genes are most useful for barcoding
eukaryotes with the exception of plants?
a.
nuclear genes
b.
chloroplast genes
c.
plasmids
d.
mitochondrial
22. The choice of using a mitochondrial gene for
barcoding of genes depends on _____.
a.
the fact that suitable primers for sequencing are
not available for nuclear genes
b.
Any gene can be used.
c.
the slow rate of evolution in mitochondrial genes
d.
that there is less variability between individuals
of a same species than between individuals of
different species
23. While planning an ecological preserve,
conservationists plan for an area limited in size with
highly diversified niches, which provide habitats to a rich
diversity of species. With these constraints in mind, decide
which of the following ecosystems is the foundation of the
preserve design?
a.
desert
b.
islands
c.
the tropical
