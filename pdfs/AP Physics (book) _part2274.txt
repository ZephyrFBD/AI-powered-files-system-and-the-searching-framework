40. (II) A long pair of insulated wires serves to conduct 24.5 A
of dc current to and from an instrument. If the wires are of
negligible diameter but are 2.8 mm apart, what is the
magnetic field 10.0 cm from their midpoint, in their 
plane (Fig.20–57)?
Compare to the
magnetic field of
the Earth.

41. (II) A third wire is placed in the plane of the two wires
shown in Fig. 20–57 parallel and just to the right. If it
carries 25.0 A upward, what force per meter of length does
it exert on each of the other two wires? Assume it is 2.8 mm
from the nearest wire, center to center.
42. (III) Two long thin parallel wires 13.0 cm apart carry 28-A
currents in the same
direction. Determine
the magnetic field
vector at a point
10.0 cm 
from 
one
wire and 6.0 cm from
the other (Fig.20–58).
