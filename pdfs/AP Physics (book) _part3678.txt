nd certain variable stars). Although stars
seem fixed in relation to each other, many move sufficiently for the motion to be
detected. Speeds of stars relative to neighboring stars can be hundreds of 
but at their great distance from us, this motion is detectable only by careful
measurement. There is also a great range of brightness among stars, due to
differences in the rate stars emit energy and to their different distances from us.
Luminosity and Brightness of Stars
Any star or galaxy has an intrinsic luminosity, L (or simply luminosity), which is its 
total power radiated in watts. Also important is the apparent brightness, b, defined
as the power crossing unit area at the Earth perpendicular to the path of the light.
Given that energy is conserved, and ignoring any absorption in space, the total
emitted power L when it reaches a distance d from the star will be spread over a
sphere of surface area 
If d is the distance from the star to the Earth, then 
L must be equal to 
times b
