e addition of 
bromthymol blue to the same solution leads to a yellow 
color. (a) Is the solution acidic, neutral, or basic? (b) Which 
of the following can you establish about the solution: (i) A 
minimum pH, (ii) A maximum pH, or (iii) A specific range 
of pH values? (c) What other indicator or indicators would 
you want to use to determine the pH of the solution more 
precisely?
Strong Acids and Bases (Section 16.5)
 16.41  Is each of the following statements true or false? (a) All 
strong acids contain one or more H atoms. (b) A strong acid 
is a strong electrolyte. (c) A 1.0-M solution of a strong acid 
will have pH = 1.0.
 16.42  Determine whether each of the following is true or false: 
(a) All strong bases are salts of the hydroxide ion. (b) The 
addition of a strong base to water produces a solution of 
pH 7 7.0. (c) Because Mg1OH22 is not very soluble, it can-
not be a strong base.
 16.43  Calculate the pH of each of the following strong acid solu-
tions: (a) 8.5 * 10-3M HBr,
