energy 
generated from burning fossil fuels. How-
ever, in recent years the cost of solar energy 
has decreased more rapidly than most people 
thought possible, decreasing more than 50% 
in just the past five years (Figure 1.22). 
Not surprisingly, over the last six years 
the number of solar panel installations world-
wide has increased sixfold. Over the same pe-
riod, the number of coal plants operating in 
the United States has decreased by 38%, from 
523 to 323. China is on track to install plants 
capable of generating more than 18 gigawatts 
of solar energy in 2015, nearly equal to the en-
tire solar energy capacity of the United States. 
Furthermore, with the price of solar energy 
dropping rapidly, there is reason to believe 
that developing nations may forgo building 
fossil fuel power plants and skip straight to 
green energy technologies like solar and wind.
Recently, chemists have discovered a new 
class of materials called halide perovskites that 
have the potential to bri
