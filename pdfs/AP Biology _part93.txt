protons. While protons diffuse down its gradient, sucrose is
being carried against its gradient. See Figure 3.17.

The contractile vacuole in freshwater Protista pumps out excess
water that has diffused inward because the cell lives in a hypotonic
environment.
Exocytosis—Internal vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to
secrete macromolecules out of a cell. For example, in nerve cells,
vesicles release neurotransmitters into a synapse.
Endocytosis—A cell takes in macromolecules and particles by
forming new vesicles derived from the plasma membrane.
a)
Pinocytosis, cell drinking, is the uptake of large, dissolved
particles. The plasma membrane invaginates around the
particles and encloses them in a vesicle; see Figure 3.18.

b)
Phagocytosis is the engulfing of large particles or small cells
by pseudopods. The cell membrane wraps around the particle
and encloses it into a vacuole. This is the way
