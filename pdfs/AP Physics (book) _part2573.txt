 sign), we have
(23;9)
For an upright image the magnification is positive, and for an inverted image the
magnification is negative.
From sign convention 1, it follows that the power (Eq. 23–7) of a converging
lens, in diopters, is positive, whereas the power of a diverging lens is negative.
A converging lens is sometimes referred to as a positive lens, and a diverging lens
as a negative lens.
Diverging lenses (see Fig. 23–41) always produce an upright virtual image for
any real object, no matter where that object is. Converging lenses can produce
real (inverted) images as in Fig. 23–40, or virtual (upright) images, depending on
object position, as we shall see.
