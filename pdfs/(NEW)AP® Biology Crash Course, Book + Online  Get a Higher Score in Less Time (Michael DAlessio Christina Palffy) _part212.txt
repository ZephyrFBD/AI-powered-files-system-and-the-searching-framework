% Change in Mass vs. Concentration of Sucrose
Interpretation of this Exercise
As the concentration of the solute increases, water diffuses into the dialysis bag (hypotonic to
hypertonic), increasing the mass of the dialysis bag. As an isotonic solution is evident with distilled
water, diffusion is occurring at equal rates into and out of the dialysis bag.

% Change in Mass vs. Concentration of Sucrose
Interpretation of this Exercise
The contents in the beaker and the percentage change in mass, as recorded in the chart above, is then
graphed to demonstrate the relationship of the change in mass to the concentration of sucrose.
Essentially, when the line crosses the x-axis at 0.36 M (estimation), then the concentration of the
