bent. Either way, the dependent variable of
temperature must be taken away from the target group because a change
in volume should have occurred in the respirometer of the target group
as well as in the respirometer of the control group. As a result, it can be
assumed that an additional 0.1 mL (for a total of 0.4 mL) of O2 was likely
used by the germinating seeds. In the experiment, 0.4 mL of gas were not
measured because 0.1 mL of gas was obscured by the expansion of gas
from some unknown factor, likely increased temperature. An accurate
measure of the target group can never be obtained if the control group
isn’t included in the experiment.
Think about how cellular respiration is a conserved evolutionary process
or how diﬀerent ecological habitats have modified the capture and use of
free energy by diﬀerent organisms. By thinking outside the box, you will
be better able to apply your knowledge across the entire AP Biology
exam. This is particularly helpful when addressing free-respons
