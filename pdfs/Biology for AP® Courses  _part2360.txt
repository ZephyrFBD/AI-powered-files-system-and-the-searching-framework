viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or fusion. Many
enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses. On
the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among others, use special
fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the
genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.
After making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new vir
