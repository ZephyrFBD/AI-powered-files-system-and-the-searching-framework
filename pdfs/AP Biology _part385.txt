Each will produce one band on the gel. In this case, there is one
large piece (A), one smaller piece (B), and one very small piece (C).
(IST-1)
(D) EcoRI stands for E. coli restriction enzyme #1. It was the first
restriction enzyme discovered. It acts as molecular scissors, cutting
DNA at certain recognition sites. Choice A is not correct because
that choice is referring to T2 bacteriophage. Choice B is not correct
because that choice is referring to the bacterium E. coli, not the
restriction enzyme. Choice C is not correct because EcoRI is not
DNA. (IST-1)
(C) DNA polymerase adds new nucleotides to the 3â€² end of a
growing strand of DNA. It cannot add nucleotides to a naked strip of
DNA. There must be an RNA primer there first. Choice A is
referring to ligase. Cho
