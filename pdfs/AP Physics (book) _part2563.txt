the focal length to specify the strength of eyeglass (or contact) lenses.
This is called the power, P, of a lens:
(23;7)
The unit for lens power is the diopter (D), which is an inverse meter:
For example, a 20-cm-focal-length lens has a power 
We will mainly use the focal length, but we will refer again to the power of a lens
when we discuss eyeglass lenses in Chapter 25.
The most important parameter of a lens is its focal length f, which is the same
on both sides of the lens. For a converging lens, f can be measured by finding 
the image point for the Sun or other distant objects. Once f is known, the image
position can be determined for any object. To find the image point by drawing rays
would be difficult if we had to determine the refractive angles at the front surface
of the lens and again at the back surface where the ray exits. We can save ourselves
a lot of effort by making use of certain facts we already know, such as that a ray
parallel to the axis of the lens passes (after r
