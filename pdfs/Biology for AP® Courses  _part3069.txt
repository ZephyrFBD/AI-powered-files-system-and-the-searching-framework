-gated channels, on the
postsynaptic membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic
membrane, as detailed in Table 26.1. For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and
muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na+ channels to open. Na+
enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called an excitatory
postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Release of
neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), a hyperpolarization of the
presynaptic membrane. For example, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a
presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl- channels. Cl- ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the
