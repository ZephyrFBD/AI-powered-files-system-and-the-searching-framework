lid and pure water, as shown for KCl in Figure 19.10. The ions in the liquid move 
in a volume that is larger than the volume in which they were able to move in the crys-
tal lattice and so undergo more motion. This increased motion might lead us to con-
clude that the entropy of the system has increased. We have to be careful, however, 
because some of the water molecules have lost some freedom of motion because they 
are now held around the ions as water of hydration. 
 (Section 13.1) These water 
molecules are in a more ordered state than before because they are now confined to the 
immediate environment of the ions. Therefore, the dissolving of a salt involves both 
a disordering process (the ions become less confined) and an ordering process (some 
water molecules become more confined). The disordering processes are usually dom-
inant, and so the overall effect is an increase in the randomness of the system when 
most salts dissolve in water.
Now, imagine arranging biomolecules in
