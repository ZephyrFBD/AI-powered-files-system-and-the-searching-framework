nts; at this point, the designations of products and reactants are reversed. This back and forth continues until
a certain relative balance between reactants and products occurs—a state called equilibrium. These situations of reversible
reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and
products.
For example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (H+) bind to bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) forming an equilibrium state
with carbonic acid (H2CO3). If carbonic acid were added to this system, some of it would be converted to bicarbonate and

In biological reactions, however, equilibrium is rarely obtained because the concentrations of the reactants or products or
both are constantly changing, often with a product of one reaction being a reactant for another. To return to the
