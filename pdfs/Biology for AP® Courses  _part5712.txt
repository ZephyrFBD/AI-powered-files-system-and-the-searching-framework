of intelligence. I agree with that in every way. Waveform information
is delivered electrically by the senses to the brain which constructs a
digital holographic reality that we call the ‘world’. This digital level
of reality can be read by the esoteric art of numerology. Digital
holograms are at the cuĴing edge of holographics today. We have
digital technology everywhere designed to access and manipulate
our digital level of perceived reality. Synthetic mRNA in ‘Covid
vaccines’ has a digital component to manipulate the body’s digital
‘operating system’.
Reality is numbers
How many know that our reality can be broken down to numbers
and codes that are the same as computer games? Max Tegmark, a
physicist at the MassachuseĴs Institute of Technology (MIT), is the
author of Our Mathematical Universe in which he lays out how reality
can be entirely described by numbers and maths in the way that a
video game is encoded with the ‘physics’ of computer games. Our
world and computer virtual real
