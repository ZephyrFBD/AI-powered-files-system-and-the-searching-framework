te is pictured as fit-

Lysozyme is an enzyme that is important to the functioning of our 
immune system because it accelerates reactions that damage (or “lyse”) bac-
terial cell walls. Figure 14.27 shows a model of the enzyme lysozyme without 
and with a bound substrate molecule.
The combination of enzyme and substrate is called the enzyme–substrate 
complex. Although Figure 14.26 shows both the active site and its substrate as 
having a fixed shape, the active site is often fairly flexible and so may change 
shape as it binds the substrate. The binding between substrate and active site 
involves dipole–dipole attractions, hydrogen bonds, and dispersion forces.
