FIGURE 23–37 Finding the 
image by ray tracing for a 
converging lens. Rays are 
shown leaving one point on 
the object (an arrow). Shown 
are the three most useful 
rays, leaving the tip of the 
object, for determining 
where the image of that 
point is formed. (Note that 
the focal points F and 
on 
either side of the lens are 
the same distance f from
the center of the lens.)

Using these three rays for one object point, we can find the image point for
that point of the object (the top of the arrow in Fig. 23–37). The image points for
all other points on the object can be found similarly to determine the complete
image of the object. Because the rays actually pass through the image for the case
shown in Fig. 23–37, it is a real image (see pages 647 and or 651). The image
could be detected by film or electronic s
