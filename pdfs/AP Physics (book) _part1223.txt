FIGURE 11–45 Wave diffraction.
In (a) the waves pass through a slit
and into the “shadow region” behind.
In (b) the waves are coming from 
the upper left. As they pass an 
obstacle, they bend around it into the
shadow region behind it.

An oscillating (or vibrating) object undergoes simple harmonic
motion (SHM) if the restoring force is proportional to (the
negative of) the displacement,
(11;1)
The maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the
amplitude.
The period, T, is the time required for one complete cycle
(back and forth), and the frequency, f, is the number of cycles
per second; they are related by
(11;2)
The period of oscillation for a mass m on the end of a
spring is given by
(11;6a)
SHM is sinusoidal, whic
