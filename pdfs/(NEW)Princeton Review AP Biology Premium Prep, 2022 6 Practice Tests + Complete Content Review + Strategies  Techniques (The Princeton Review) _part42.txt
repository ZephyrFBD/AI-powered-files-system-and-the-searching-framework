Question 50–53 refer to the following passage.
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a common type of protein receptor containing seven transmembrane
segments and bearing intracellular and extracellular portions. The structure of a typical GPCR and its associated
partners is shown below. GPCRs are coupled to G-proteins consisting of three subunits (α, β, and γ) that bind the
nucleotides GTP or GDP on the intracellular side of the GPCR. The presence or absence of a ligand on the
extracellular side of the GPCR de
