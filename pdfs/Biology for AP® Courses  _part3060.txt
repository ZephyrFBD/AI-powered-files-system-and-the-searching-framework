a much faster rate than sodium
leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively
charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential,
once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K+ ions into the cell while removing three Na+ ions per
ATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged
relative to the extracellular fluid. It should be noted that chloride ions (Clâ€“) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because
they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.
