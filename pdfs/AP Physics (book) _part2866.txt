17. (II) A person has a far point of 14 cm. What power glasses
would correct this vision if the glasses were placed 2.0 cm
from the eye? What power contact lenses, placed on the
eye, would the person need?
18. (II) One lens of a nearsighted person’s eyeglasses has a
focal length of 
and the lens is 1.8 cm from the
eye. If the person switches to contact lenses placed directly
on the eye, what should be the focal length of the corre-
sponding contact lens?
19. (II) What is the focal length of the eye–lens system when
viewing an object (a) at infinity, and (b) 34 cm from the
eye? Assume that the lens–retina distance is 2.0 cm.
20. (III) The closely packed cones in the fovea of the eye have
a diameter of about 
For the eye to discern two images
on the fovea as distinct, assume that the images must be
separated by at least one cone that is not excited. If these
images are of two point-like objects at the eye’s 25-cm near
point, how far apart are the
