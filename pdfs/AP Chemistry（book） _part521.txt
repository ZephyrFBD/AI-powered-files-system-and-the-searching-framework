re of N21g2 and H21g2 reacts in a closed container 
to form ammonia, NH31g2. The reaction ceases before 
 
either reactant has been totally consumed. At this stage 
3.0 mol N2, 3.0 mol H2, and 3.0 mol NH3 are present. How 
many moles of N2 and H2 were present originally?
 3.104  A mixture containing KClO3, K2CO3, KHCO3, and KCl was 
heated, producing CO2, O2, and H2O gases according to the 
following equations:
 
      2 KClO31s2 ยก 2 KCl1s2 + 3 O21g2 
 
 
 2 KHCO31s2 ยก K2O1s2 + H2O1g2 + 2 CO21g2 
 
      K2CO31s2 ยก K2O1s2 + CO21g2
 
 The KCl does not react under the conditions of the reaction. If 
100.0 g of the mixture produces 1.80 g of H2O, 13.20 g of CO2, 
and 4.00 g of O2, what was the composition of the original 
mixture? (Assume complete decomposition of the mixture.)
 3.105 When a mixture of 10.0 g of acetylene 1C2H22 and 10.0 g of 
oxygen 1O22 is ignited, the resulting combustion reaction 
produces CO2 and H2O. (a) Write the balanced chemical 
equation for this reaction. (b) W
