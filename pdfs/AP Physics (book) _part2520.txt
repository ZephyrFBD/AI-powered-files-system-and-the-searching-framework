, and another assuming it is upside down. Figure 23–9 is drawn
assuming the photo is upside down. In this case, the Sun blocked by the tree
would be the direct view, and the full view of the Sun the reflection: the ray which
reflects off the water and into the camera travels at an angle below the branch,
whereas the ray that travels directly to the camera passes through the branches.
This works. Try to draw a diagram assuming the photo is right side up (thus assum-
ing that the image of the Sun in the reflection is higher above the horizon than 
it is as viewed directly). It won’t work. The photo on p. 644 is upside down.
Also, what about the people in the photo? Try to draw a diagram showing why
they don’t appear in the reflection. [Hint: Assume they are not sitting at the edge of
the pool, but back from the edge.] Then try to draw a diagram of the reverse (i.e.,
assume the photo is right side up so the people are visible only in the reflection).
Reflected images are not perfect repli
