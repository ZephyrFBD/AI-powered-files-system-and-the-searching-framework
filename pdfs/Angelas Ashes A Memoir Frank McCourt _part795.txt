 Irish Times and wondering if it’s an occasion of 
 
 sin though I don’t care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not 
 
 coughing I don’t go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and 
 
 The Times of London because that tells me what the King is up to every 
 
 day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing. 
 
 I read English women’s magazines for all the food articles and the 
 
 answers to women’s questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents 
 
 and pretend they’re reading from English women’s magazines. 
 
 Peter says, Dear Miss Hope, I’m going out with a fellow from Ireland 
 
 named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing 
 
 pushing against my belly button and I’m demented not knowing what 
 
  
  
 to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith,Yorkshire. 
 
 Eamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he’s pushing 
 
 his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man 
 
 who will slip it between your thighs
