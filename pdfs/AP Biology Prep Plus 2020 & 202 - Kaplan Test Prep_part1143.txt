led correctly in (D).
14. C
According to the pedigree, the 1st generation father is aﬀected (has MFS)
and the mother is not. Out of their four children, one male and one female
have MFS. In the 3rd generation, both of these aﬀected siblings produce
children of their own. The aﬀected 2nd generation male produces two
aﬀected females and one unaﬀected male. The 2nd generation female
produces three children, with one male having MFS. The pattern of
inheritance presented here is autosomal dominant. The genetic mutation
is not passed on through the sex chromosomes, and MFS occurs in both
sexes. (C) is correct.
In the 2nd generation, the aﬀected female and unaﬀected male produce
an aﬀected male. The 2nd generation father is not aﬀected yet still has a
son who does have MFS. This tells you that the mutation, in this case, was
passed on through the mother’s chromosomes. (A) is incorrect. (B) is a
tempting answer choice, since either the father or mother can pass on the
genetic mutation. However
