 total individuals in the original population.
There are some limitations to the mark and recapture method. Some animals from the first catch may learn to avoid capture
in the second round, thus inflating population estimates. Alternatively, animals may preferentially be retrapped (especially
if a food reward is offered), resulting in an underestimate of population size. Also, some species may be harmed by the
marking technique, reducing their survival. A variety of other techniques have been developed, including the electronic
tracking of animals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data from commercial fishing and trapping operations to
estimate the size and health of populations and communities.
Species Distribution
In addition to measuring simple density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the
