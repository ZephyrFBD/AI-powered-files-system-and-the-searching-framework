c” factors such as the size, shape, number of turns, and
relative positions of the two coils, and also on whether iron (or other ferromagnetic
material) is present. For example, the farther apart the two coils are in Fig. 21–35,
the fewer lines of flux can pass through coil 2, so M will be less. If we consider the
inverse situation—a changing current in coil 2 inducing an emf in coil 1—the
proportionality constant, M, turns out to have the same value,
(21;8b)
A transformer is an example of mutual inductance in which the coupling is
maximized so that nearly all flux lines pass through both coils. Mutual inductance
has other uses as well, including inductive charging of cell phones, electric cars,
and other devices with rechargeable batteries, as we discussed in Section 21–7.
Some types of pacemakers used to maintain blood flow in heart patients 
(Section 19–6) receive their power from an external coil which is transmitted via
mutual inductance to a second coil in the pacemaker near the
