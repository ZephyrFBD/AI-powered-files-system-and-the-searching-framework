Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to
the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not
translated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the
nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before
the protein-coding region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' UTR (Figure
16.13). The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the
specific RBP that binds.
