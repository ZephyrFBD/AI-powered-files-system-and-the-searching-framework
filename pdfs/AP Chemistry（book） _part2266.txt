It is not possible to distin-
guish between the two proposed reaction mechanisms.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Ozone reacts with nitrogen dioxide to produce dinitrogen 
pentoxide and oxygen:
O31g2 + 2 NO21g2 ¡ N2O51g2 + O21g2
The reaction is believed to occur in two steps:
O31g2 + NO21g2 ¡ NO31g2 + O21g2
NO31g2 + NO21g2 ¡ N2O51g2
The experimental rate law is rate = k3O343NO24. What 
can you say about the relative rates of the two steps of the 
mechanism?
Give It Some Thought
Why are termolecular elementary steps rare in gas-phase reactions?
Let’s consider an alternative mechanism that does not involve a termolecular step:
 
Step 1:         NO1g2 + Br21g2 ∆
k1
k - 1
NOBr21g2      1fast2
 
Step 2:  NOBr21g2 + NO1g2 ¡
k2
2 NOBr1g2  1slow2 
[14.29]
In this mechanism, step 1 involves two processes: a forward reaction and its reverse.
Because step 2 is the rate-determining step, the rate law for that step governs the rate 
of the overall reaction:
 
Rate = k23NOBr243NO4 
[14.30]
Note that NOBr2 is
