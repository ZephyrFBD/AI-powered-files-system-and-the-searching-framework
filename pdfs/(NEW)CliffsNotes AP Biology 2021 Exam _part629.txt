ited behaviors and learning capabilities of animals have evolved because they increase individual
fitness. Innate behavior, such as an FAP, improves fitness by providing a successful and dependable mechanism for
the animal to perform in response to an event that, through evolution, has become expected. By establishing an FAP,
a particular challenge need not be resolved repeatedly by every generation. In contrast, imprinting allows a certain
amount of flexibility. If a mother is killed before her chick hatches, the chick will, through imprinting, choose
another nearby bird for its mother (most likely of the same species).
Associative learning allows individuals to benefit from exposure to unexpected(or novel) repeated events. Once they
form an association with the event, they can respond to the next occurrence more efficiently. Habituation allows
individuals to ignore repetitive events which, from experience, they know are inconsequential. As a result, the
animals can remain focused on
