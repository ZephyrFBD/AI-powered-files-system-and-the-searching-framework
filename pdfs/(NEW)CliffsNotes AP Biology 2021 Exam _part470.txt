 by fragmentation, budding, or the production of haploid spores that result
from mitosis of haploid hyphae.
Kingdom Plantae
When we think of plants, we think green things that use sunlight for photosynthesis. But plants live almost
everywhere and, as a result, their characteristics are as diverse as the diversity of their habitats. In general, plants
share the following features:
1. All plants are multicellular.
 
2. All plants are autotrophic (or have evolved from autotrophic ancestors).
 
3. All plants are rooted in the ground (or other substrate).
The AP exam evaluates your understanding of the differences among plants. In particular, it focuses on strategies
that plants use to respond to changes in environmental conditions and other environmental stimuli. These strategies
will be fully discussed in Chapter 12, “Plants.”
Kingdom Animalia
Although the animal kingdom is extremely diverse, its members share a number of characteristics, as follows:
1. All animals are multicellular.
2. A
