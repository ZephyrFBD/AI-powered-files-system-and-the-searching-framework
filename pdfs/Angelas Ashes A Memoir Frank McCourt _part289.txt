’d mind taking down 
 
 that statue because he’s a Protestant and he wouldn’t be able to sleep. 
 
 Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a 
 
 Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and 
 
 down the lane and beyond. 
 
 Uncle Pat says he didn’t know Bill Galvin was a Protestant.You 
 
 could never tell by looking at him especially the way he’s covered with 
 
 lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you’d never imagine a 
 
 Protestant would be shoveling lime. 
 
 Bill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she 
 
 had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin 
 
 Mary showing their hearts. He’s not against the Sacred Heart himself, 
 
 it’s just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give 
 
 him the heartache. 
 
  
  
 Grandma says,Ah, God help us, why didn’t you tell me that in the 
 
 first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and
