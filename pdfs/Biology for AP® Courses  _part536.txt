embrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. Carbohydrates are present only
on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins, forming glycoproteins, or attached to lipids,
forming glycolipids.
Phospholipids
The main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules. The hydrophilic or “water-loving”
areas of these molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artist’s rendition of the model) (Figure 5.2) are in contact
with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. Hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar.
They interact with other non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules.
When placed in water, hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. The hydrophilic regions of the phospholipids
tend to form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the exterior and interior of the cell. Thus, the
membrane surfaces that fac
