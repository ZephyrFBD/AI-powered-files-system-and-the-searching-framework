, which allowed the cell cycle to proceed. Then at the higher temperature, it caused them to stop the cell
cycle. I predict if they begin at the high temp, they won’t have a cell cycle, and then when they shift to the lower
temperature, it will begin to grow and the cell cycle will continue.
Question 4
a. Describe what happened to the biodiversity of the ecosystem before and after the fire.
The biodiversity of the ecosystem increased following the fire.
b. Explain your description in (a) using Simpson’s Diversity Index.
Before the fire:
D = 0.004624 + 0.101124 + 0.018496 + 0.227529 = 0.351773
Simpson’s Diversity Index = 1 – D = 0.648227
After the fire:
D = 0.05129+ 0.042025 + 0.098596+ 0.05129 = 0.24301
Simpson’s Diversity Index = 1 – D = 0.756799
The Simpson’s Diversity Index increased, meaning that biodiversity of the ecosystem increased.
c. Predict what would happen to the biodiversity if there was an invasive insect species introduced into this
ecosystem.
The addition of an invasiv
