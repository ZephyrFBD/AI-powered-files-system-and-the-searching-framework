†This calculation confirms the entry in Table 10–2, 1 atm = 76.0 cm-Hg.
FIGURE 10–9 A water barometer:
a full tube of water (longer than 10 m),
closed at the top, is inserted into a
tub of water. When the submerged
bottom end of the tube is unplugged,
some water flows out of the tube
into the tub, leaving a vacuum at the
top of the tube above the water’s
upper surface. Why? Because air
pressure can support a column of
water only 10 m high.

invented by Torricelli, is shown here
when the air pressure is standard
atmospheric, 76.0 cm-Hg.
