EXERCISE C What is the Schwarzschild radius for an object with 10 solar masses?
The Schwarzschild radius also represents the event horizon of a black hole.
By event horizon we mean the surface beyond which no emitted signals can ever
reach us, and thus inform us of events that happen beyond that surface. As a star
collapses toward a black hole, the light it emits is pulled harder and harder by
gravity, but we can still see it. Once the matter passes within the event horizon,
the emitted light cannot escape but is pulled back in by gravity (
of
space-time).
All we can know about a black hole is its mass, its angular momentum
(rotating black holes), and its electric charge. No other information, no 
details of its structure or the kind of matter it was formed of, can be known
because no information can escape.
How might we observe black holes? We cannot see them because no light
can escape from them. They would be black objects
