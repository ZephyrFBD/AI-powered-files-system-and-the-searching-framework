 shape. Enzymes do not increase the number of collisions; rather,
an increase in heat does. Enzymes make collisions more effective,
not faster. (ENE-1)
(B) The key to understanding graphs that depict enzyme reactions—
whether they are endergonic or exergonic—is that the potential
energy (PE) of the reactants and of the products is the same before
and after the reaction. The only thing that differs between enzyme-
catalyzed reactions and reactions without enzymes is the PE of the
transition state. It is lower in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Choice A
is not correct because enzymes do not make a reaction occur (that
would not occur naturally); they only increase the number of
effective collisions. Choice C is not correct because enzymes
decrease the energy of activation. Choice D is not correct because
the potential energy of the reactants remains the same with or
without an enzyme present. (SP 4)
(D) Substrate is used up as the product is formed. Enzymes are never
used up; they are reused
