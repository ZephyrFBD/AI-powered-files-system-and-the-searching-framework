Surface Area of a Rectangular Solid 
surface area of each side  
A = Â
r = radius  
 = length 
h = height 
w = width 
s = length of one 
side of a cube 
A = surface area 
V = volume 
 = sum of all 
Gibbs Free Energy 
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS 
ΔG = change in Gibbs free energy 
ΔS = change in entropy 
ΔH = change in enthalpy  
T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)

Y  = solute potential 
 
The water potential will be equal to 
the solute potential of a solution in an 
open container because the pressure 
potential of the solution in an open 
container is zero.

i = ionization constant (this is 1.0 for 
sucrose because sucrose does not 
ionize in water) 
 
C = molar concentration 
 
R = pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter
bars/mole K) 
 
 
T = temperature in Kelvin
