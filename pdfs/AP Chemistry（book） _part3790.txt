 23.94  A manganese complex formed from a solution containing 
potassium bromide and oxalate ion is purified and ana-
lyzed. It contains 10.0% Mn, 28.6% potassium, 8.8% car-
bon, and 29.2% bromine by mass. The remainder of the 
compound is oxygen. An aqueous solution of the complex 
has about the same electrical conductivity as an equim-
olar solution of K43Fe(CN)64. Write the formula of the 
compound, using brackets to denote the manganese and its 
coordination sphere.
 23.95  The E° values for two low-spin iron complexes in acidic 
solution are as follows:
3Fe(o@phen)343+(aq) + e- ∆ 
 
3Fe(o@phen)342+(aq)  E° = 1.12 V
3Fe(CN)643-(aq) + e- ∆ 
 
    3Fe(CN)644-(aq)  E° = 0.36 V
(a) Is it thermodynamically favorable to reduce both Fe(III) 
complexes to their Fe(II) analogs? Explain. (b) Which com-
plex, 3Fe(o@phen)343+ or 3Fe(CN)643-, is more difficult to 
reduce? (c) Suggest an explanation for your ans
