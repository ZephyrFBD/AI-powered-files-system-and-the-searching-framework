 solid that has a metallic luster and conducts electric-
ity. It consists of parallel sheets of sp2@hybridized carbon atoms held together by disper-
sion forces. 
 (Section 12.7) Diamond is a clear, hard solid in which the carbon atoms 
form an sp3@hybridized covalent network. 
 (Section 12.7) Diamond is denser than 
graphite (d = 2.25 g>cm3 for graphite; d = 3.51 g>cm3 for diamond). At approximately 
100,000 atm at 3000 Â°C, graphite converts to diamond. In fact, almost any carbon- 
containing substance, if put under sufficiently high pressure, forms diamonds; scientists 
at General Electric in the 1950s used peanut butter to make diamonds. About 3 * 104 kg 
of industrial-grade diamonds are synthesized each year, mainly for use in cutting, grind-
ing, and polishing tools.
Graphite has a well-defined crystalline structure, but it also exists in two common 
amorphous forms: carbon black and charcoal. Carbon black is formed when hydro-
carbons are heated in a very limited supply of oxygen
