s used and its 
divisions are 0.1 and 0.01 mL. An error in measurement may then be expressed by a 
power of 10. 
 
Procedures 1 and 2 are designed to help students understand concepts related to the 
activity of enzymes before they design and conduct their own investigation.  
A basic enzymatic and substrate reaction can be depicted as follows:  
Enzyme + Substrate → Enzyme-Substrate Complex → Enzyme + Products + ∆ G 
For this investigation the specific reaction is as follows: 
(Peroxidase + Hydrogen Peroxide → Complex → Peroxidase + Water + Oxygen) 
2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2 (gas) 
Peroxidase is an enzyme that breaks down peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, and 
is produced by most cells in their peroxisomes. Peroxide is a toxic byproduct of aerobic 
metabolism. Various factors — abiotic and biotic — could have a major influence on the 
efficiency of this reaction. 
To determine the rate of an enzymatic reaction, a change in the amount of at least 
one specific substrate or product is measu
