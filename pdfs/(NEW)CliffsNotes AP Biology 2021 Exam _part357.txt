4. Transcription initiation is regulated by a transcription complex, a group of various proteins that are associated
with RNA polymerase activity. The makeup of the transcription complex determines the degree to which
transcription is activated or repressed. There are several components to the complex:
General transcription factors are proteins that are required by all transcription events to successfully initiate
transcription by RNA polymerase. General transcription factors attach with the RNA polymerase to the promoter
region upstream and adjacent to the gene to be transcribed. Some general transcription factors target the TATA box
sequence associated with the promoter region.
Specific transcription factors are additional proteins associated with regulating specific transcription activitiesâ€”
specific to cell type, specific to the particular genes, or specific to the timing of the transcription. There are two
kinds of specific transcription factors: activators and repressors. Speci
