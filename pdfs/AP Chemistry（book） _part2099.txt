▶Practice Exercise 2
Camphor 1C10H16O2 melts at 179.8 °C, and it has a 
particularly large freezing-point-depression constant, 
Kf = 40.0 °C>m. When 0.186 g of an organic substance of un-
known molar mass is dissolved in 22.01 g of liquid camphor, 
the freezing point of the mixture is found to be 176.7 °C. 
What is the molar mass of the solute?

Colligative Properties 
551
The colligative properties of solutions depend on the total concen-
tration of solute particles, regardless of whether the particles are ions 
or molecules. Thus, we expect a 0.100 m solution of NaCl to have a 
freezing-point depression of 12210.100 m211.86 °C>m2 = 0.372 °C 
because it is 0.100 m in Na+1aq2 and 0.100 m in Cl-1aq2. The mea-
sured freezing-point depression is only 0.348 °C, however, and the 
situation is similar for other strong electrolytes. A 0.100
