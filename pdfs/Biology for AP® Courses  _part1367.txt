tion: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/
constricted, 888 dwarf/inflated, and 300 dwarf/constricted. Reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if they are
consistent with Mendelian laws.
Form a conclusion: Were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio? Do the results support the
prediction? What might be observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate randomly into gametes?
Try to imagine growing that many pea plants, and consider the potential for experimental error. For instance, what
would happen if it was extremely windy one day?

Think About It
In the shepherdâ€™s-purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), seed shape is controlled by two genes, A and
B. When both the A and B loci are homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are ovoid. However, if
the dominant allele for either or both of these genes is present, the seeds are triangular. Based on this
information, what are the expected phenotypic ratio
