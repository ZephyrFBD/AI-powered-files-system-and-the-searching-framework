ydrogen in a small volume. For 
example, NaAlH4 can release 5.6% of its mass as H2 upon 
decomposing to NaH1s2, Al1s2, and H21g2. NaAlH4 pos-
sesses both covalent bonds, which hold polyatomic anions 
together, and ionic bonds. (a) Write a balanced equation 
for the decomposition of NaAlH4. (b) Which element in 
NaAlH4 is the most electronegative? Which one is the least 
 
electronegative? (c) Based on electronegativity differences, 
predict the identity of the polyatomic anion. Draw a Lewis 
structure for this ion. (d) What is the formal charge on hy-
drogen in the polyatomic ion?
 8.89 Although I3
- is a known ion, F3
- is not. (a) Draw the Lewis 
structure for I3
- (it is linear, not a triangle). (b) One of your 
classmates says that F3
- does not exist because F is too electro-
negative to make bonds with another atom. Give an example 
that proves your classmate is wrong. (c) Another classmate 
says F3
- does not exist because it would violate the octet rule. 
Is this classmate poss
