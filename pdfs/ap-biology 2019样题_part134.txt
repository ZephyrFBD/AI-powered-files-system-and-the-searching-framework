Signal Transduction
IST-3.D
Describe the role of 
components of a signal 
transduction pathway 
in producing a cellular 
response.
IST-3.D.1
Signaling begins with the recognition of a 
chemical messenger—a ligand—by a receptor 
protein in a target cell— 
a. The ligand-binding domain of a receptor 
recognizes a specific chemical messenger, 
which can be a peptide, a small chemical, or 
protein, in a specific one-to-one relationship.
b. G protein-coupled receptors are an example 
of a receptor protein in eukaryotes.
IST-3.D.2
Signaling cascades relay signals from 
receptors to cell targets, often amplifying 
the incoming signals, resulting in the 
appropriate responses by the cell, which 
could include cell growth, secretion of 
molecules, or gene expression—
