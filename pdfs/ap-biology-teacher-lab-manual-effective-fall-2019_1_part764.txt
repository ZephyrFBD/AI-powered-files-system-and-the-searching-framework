unt the number of 
flies at each end of the chamber. 
Step 10 Change the caps, and give the fruit flies another substance. 
Step 11 Gather data for at least four different substances. Which substances do fruit flies 
prefer? Which do they avoid? 
Step 12 Quantify the results and express them graphically. Complete a chi-square 
analysis of your results. Using data from the entire class, construct a preference table. 
Were your hypotheses about the preferences of fruit flies supported or not? Did the flies 
demonstrate a chemotaxis in relation to any of the substances you chose? Can you think 
of any reasons for their preferences?

â–  Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Now that you have discovered the preferences for individual substances, design an 
experiment using the choice chamber to compare the preferences of fruit flies to all test 
substances or the chemotactic responses of your flies. Create a table
