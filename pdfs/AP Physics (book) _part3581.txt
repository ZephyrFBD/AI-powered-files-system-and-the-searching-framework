Soon after, the antineutron 
was found. All particles have antiparticles. But a
few, like the photon, the 
and the Higgs, do not have distinct antiparticles—we
say that they are their own antiparticles.
Antiparticles are produced in nuclear reactions when there is sufficient
energy available to produce the required mass, and they do not live very long in
the presence of matter. For example, a positron is stable when by itself but rarely
survives for long; as soon as it encounters an electron, the two annihilate each
other. The energy of their vanished mass, plus any kinetic energy they possessed,
is usually converted into the energy of two 
rays. Annihilation also occurs for 
all other particle–antiparticle pairs.
Antimatter is a term referring to material that would be made up of
“antiatoms” in which antiprotons and antineutrons would form the nucleus
around which positrons (antielectrons) would move. The term is also used for
antiparticles
