s specific antigens. An antigen is any molecule, usually a protein or polysaccharide, that
can be identified as foreign. It may be a toxin (injected into the blood by the sting of an insect, for example), a part
of the protein coat of a virus, or a molecule unique to the plasma membranes of bacteria, protozoa, pollen, or other
foreign cells.
The major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, is the mechanism by which the immune system is able to
differentiate between self and nonself cells. The MHC is a collection of glycoproteins (proteins with a carbohydrate)
that exists on the membranes of all body cells. The proteins of a single individual are unique, originating from 20
genes, each with more than 50 alleles. Thus, it is extremely unlikely that two people, except for identical twins, will
possess cells with the same set of MHC molecules.
The primary agents of the immune response are lymphocytes, white blood cells (leukocytes) that originate in the
bone marrow (like all blood cells) but
