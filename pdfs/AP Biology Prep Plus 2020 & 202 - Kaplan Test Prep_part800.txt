. This suggests
that ammonia is a volatile compound that repels the flies, (D). (A) is
incorrect because the data shows that the flies do respond to
ammonia, moving away from it. (B) is incorrect because the data
shows that the flies are still capable of moving; the percentage close to
the ammonia-soaked tip fluctuates with time. (C) is incorrect because
more flies prefer to approach the non-soaked tip, indicating that the
ammonia actually repels them.

Learning Objective: 18.4
A volatile compound is one that evaporates easily, allowing it to
become airborne and spread out over significant distances. Thus,
jasmonate is the most likely candidate for a communication molecule,
making (A) correct. (B) is incorrect because large sugars are unlikely to
become airborne, so there is no way for them to allow for
communication between plants. (C) and (D) are incorrect because
these water soluble compounds are unlikely to become airborne, so
they would not make for eï¬€ective communication betw
