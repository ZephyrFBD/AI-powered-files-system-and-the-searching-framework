ine a world without fossil
fuels, but fossil fuels are finite resources and will
eventually run out. This is why drilling had begun in
Arctic in an effort to find a new source of fossil fuels,
though it is currently stopped. What are the dangers of
drilling in the Arctic? What are the alternatives?
a.
Drilling as well as melting of ice in the Arctic
results in the release of large amounts of
methane, accelerating global warming. Investing
in clean energy like wind, water, and solar
power, which do not release harmful gases,
could be the alternative.
b.
Drilling as well as melting of ice in the Arctic
results in the release of large amounts of carbon
monoxide, accelerating global warming.
Investing in clean energy like wind, water, and
solar power, which do not release harmful gases,
could be the alternative.
c.
Drilling as well as melting of ice in the Arctic
results in the release of large amounts of carbon
monoxide, which is lethal and can cause death.
