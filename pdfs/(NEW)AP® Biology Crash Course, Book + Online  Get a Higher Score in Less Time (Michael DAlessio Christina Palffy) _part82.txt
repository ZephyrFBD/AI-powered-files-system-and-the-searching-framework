 ratio is usually
9:3:4.
6. Polygenic inheritance—two or more genes affecting one phenotype. Examples include skin color and
cancer, which is the most common polygenic inherited disorder. Polygenic inheritance leads to a bell
curve distribution of phenotypes.
G. Pedigree Analysis—a visual depiction of inheritance patterns in multiple family generations.
1. Basic Rules
i.
If two affected people have an unaffected child, it must be a dominant pedigree: [A] is the
dominant mutant allele and [a] is the recessive allele. Both parents are Aa (hybrid carriers) and the
unaffected child is aa.
ii. If two unaffected people have an affected child, it is a recessive pedigree: [A] is the dominant
allele and [a] is the recessive allele. Both parents are Aa (hybrid carriers) and the affected child is
aa.
iii. If every affected person has an affected parent, it is a dominant pedigree (no skipping of
generations).
iv. Dominant traits never skip generations, while recessive traits can skip.
v. Squares a
