oups being compared are different (or not), hypothesis testing should be
performed. This will be discussed later in this chapter.
Association Experiments
Association experiments look for associations between variables. They attempt to determine if two variables are
correlated, and additional tests can demonstrate causation. Scatterplots are used to present data from association
experiments. Each data point is plotted as a dot. Suppose different substrate concentrations are used in an enzymatic
reaction (using the enzyme Kozmase III), and the enzyme efficiency is measured (in percent of maximum). The data
could be presented like this.
If the relationship looks linear, a linear regression line can be added. There are a few common shapes of scatterplots
you should be familiar with:
A bell-shaped curve is associated with random samples and normal distributions.
An upward curve (concave in shape) is associated with exponentially increasing functions. A common example
of this is the lag phas
