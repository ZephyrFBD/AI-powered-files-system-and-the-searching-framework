Several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles. For the purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes
using the first letter of the gene’s corresponding dominant trait. For example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea
plant’s flower color, so the flower-color gene would be abbreviated as V (note that it is customary to italicize gene
designations). Furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles,
respectively. Therefore, we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as VV, a
homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as vv, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as Vv.
