72. E. coli colonize the human gastrointestinal tract. The
temperature of that environment is tightly regulated.
However, the pH ranges from the highly acidic stomach
(pH 4.5) to the relatively basic lower intestine (pH 9).
Over the entire pH range of the environment the pH of the
E. coli cytoplasm is maintained in a narrow range between
7.2 and 7.8. Wilks and Slonczewski (Journal of
Bacteriology, 189, 2007) used a fluorescent dye to follow
the recovery of cytoplasmic pH after an acid shock
comparable to what occurs in the human stomach. They
found that the pH within the cell recovered in
approximately 2 minutes.
Rapid restoration of cytoplasmic pH does not occur in the
presence of ATPase inhibitors. Construct an explanation
for the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis with a
model of exchange of hydrogen ions (H+)
