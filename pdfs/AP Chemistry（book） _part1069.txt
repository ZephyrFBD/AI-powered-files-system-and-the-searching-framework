 6 nd2 in many-electron atoms.
Finally, let’s examine trends in valence-electron Zeff values.
 
The effective nuclear charge increases from left to right across any period  
of the periodic table.
Although the number of core electrons stays the same across the period, the number of 
protons increases—in our analogy, we are increasing the brightness of the light bulb while 
keeping the shade the same. The valence electrons added to counterbalance the increas-
ing nuclear charge screen one another ineffectively. Thus, Zeff increases steadily. For exam-
ple, the two core electrons of lithium 11s22s12 screen the 2s valence electron from the 3+ 
nucleus fairly efficiently. Consequently, the valence electron experiences an effective 
nuclear charge of roughly 3 - 2 = 1+. For beryllium 11s22s22 the effective nuclear charge 
experienced by each valence electron is larger because here the two core 1s electrons 
screen a 4+ nucleus, and each 2s electron only partially screens the other. Conseque
