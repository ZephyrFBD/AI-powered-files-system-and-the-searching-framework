 However, when the stomach is emptied,
the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid.
This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism.
In the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme
during the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas
to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone
called cholecystokinin (CCK). Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also
stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.
