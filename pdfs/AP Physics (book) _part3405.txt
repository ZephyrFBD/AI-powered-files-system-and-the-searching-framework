[*Alpha decay occurs via a purely quantum-mechanical
process called tunneling through a barrier.]
Particle detectors include Geiger counters, scintillators
with attached photomultiplier tubes,
and semiconductor
detectors. Detectors that can image particle tracks include
semiconductors, photographic emulsions, bubble chambers,
and multiwire chambers.

Summary
1. What do different isotopes of a given element have in
common? How are they different?
2. What are the elements represented by the X in the follow-
ing: (a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e)
3. How many protons and how many neutrons do each of the
isotopes in Question 2 have?
4. Identify the element that has 87 nucleons and 50 neutrons.
5. Why are the atomic masses of many elements (see the
Periodic Table) not close to whole numbers?
6. Why are atoms much more likely to emit an alpha particle
than to emit separate neutrons and protons?
