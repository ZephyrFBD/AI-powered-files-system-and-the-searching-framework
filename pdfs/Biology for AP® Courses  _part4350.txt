 use their energy to reproduce rapidly, but never attain the size that would give them defense against some
predators. Larger fish, like the bluegill or shark, use their energy to attain a large size, but do so with the risk that they
will die before they can reproduce or at least reproduce to their maximum. These different energy strategies and tradeoffs
are key to understanding the evolution of each species as it maximizes its fitness and fills its niche. In terms of energy
budgeting, some species “blow it all” and use up most of their energy reserves to reproduce early before they die. Other
species delay having reproduction to become stronger, more experienced individuals and to make sure that they are strong
enough to provide parental care if necessary.
Single versus Multiple Reproductive Events
Some life history traits, such as fecundity, timing of reproduction, and parental care, can be grouped together into general
strategies that are used by multiple species. Semelparity occur
