divergences among vertebrates?
Your summary has revealed some similarities and
differences among vertebrate erythrocyte and circulatory
system structures. Scientific questions are testable. They
can be addressed by making observations and
measurements and analyzing the resulting data.
A.
Pose three scientific questions that arise from
your summaries of what you know about
erythrocytes and capillary size.
B.
For each question you pose, predict what you
believe would be the answer and provide
reasoning for your prediction.
C.
Describe an approach you think can be used to
obtain data to test your prediction.
D.
In the production of mammalian red blood cells,
erythrocytes that have not yet matured and are
still synthesizing heme proteins are surrounded
by a macrophage. Predict the role of the
macrophage in the maturation of a red blood
cell.
68. Mitochondria have DNA that encode proteins related
to the structures and functions of the organelles. The
replication appears to occur conti
