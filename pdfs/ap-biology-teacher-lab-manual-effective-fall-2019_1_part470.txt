lexes made of several specific proteins. These 
complexes contain enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which turn on 
or off the various processes that take place in cell division. CDK partners with a family 
of proteins called cyclins. One such complex is mitosis-promoting factor (MPF), 
sometimes called maturation-promoting factor, which contains cyclin A or B and 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). (See Figure 2a.) CDK is activated when it is bound to 
cyclin, interacting with various other proteins that, in this case, allow the cell to proceed 
from G2 into mitosis. The levels of cyclin change during the cell cycle (Figure 2b). In 
most cases, cytokinesis follows mitosis.
