NA viruses proved that it is DNA that stores and passes
on genes. They worked with viruses with an outer coat of
protein and a DNA strand inside. How did they prove that
it was DNA, not protein, which is the primary source of
heritable information?
a.
The DNA and protein of the virus were tagged
with different isotopes and exposed to host cell
where only the DNA was transferred to the host.
b.
The DNA was tagged with an isotope, which
was retained in the virus, proving it to be the
genetic material.
c.
The viral protein was tagged with an isotope,
and the host cell was infected by it. This protein
was transferred to the host.
d.
The viral DNA, when sequenced, was found to
be present in the host cell proving it to be the
hereditary material instead of protein.
73. The genetic code is based on each amino acid being
coded for by a distinctive series of three nucleic acid bases
called a codon. The following is a short segment of DNA
