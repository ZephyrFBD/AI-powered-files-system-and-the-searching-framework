EXERCISE D When a spinning figure skater pulls in her arms, her moment of inertia
decreases; to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity increases. Does her
rotational kinetic energy also increase? If so, where does the energy come from?
A similar example is the diver shown in Fig. 8–28. The push as she leaves the
board gives her an initial angular momentum about her center of mass. When 
she curls herself into the tuck position, she rotates quickly one or more times. She
then stretches out again, increasing her moment of inertia which reduces the
angular velocity to a small value, and then she enters the water. The change in
moment of inertia from the straight position to the tuck position can be a factor
of as much as 
Note that for angular momentum to be conserved, the net torque must be
zero; but the net force does not necessarily have to be zero. The net force on the
