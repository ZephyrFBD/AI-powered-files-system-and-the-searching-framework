red to the other two.  
Figure 12.13 A hexagonal lattice Figure 12.15 The solvent is 
the majority component and the solute the minority component. 
Therefore, there will be more solvent atoms than solute atoms.  
Figure 12.17 The samarium atoms sit on the corners of the unit 
cell so there is only 8 * 11>82 = 1 Sm atom per unit cell. Eight of 
the nine cobalt atoms sit on faces of the unit cell, and the other sits 
in the middle of the unit cell so there are 8 * 11>22 + 1 = 5 Co 
atoms per unit cell. Figure 12.19 P4, S8, and Cl2 are all molecules, 
because they have strong chemical bonds between atoms and have 
well-defined numbers of atoms per molecule. Figure 12.21 In the 
fourth period, vanadium and chromium have very similar melting 
points. Molybdenum and tungsten have the highest melting points 
in the fifth and sixth periods, respectively. All of these elements are 
located near the middle of the period where the bonding orbitals 
areÂ mostly filled and the antibonding orbitals
