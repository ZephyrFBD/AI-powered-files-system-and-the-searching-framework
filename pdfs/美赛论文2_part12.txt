this time when λ is assumed to be constant. Every infective person can 
turn λS(t) susceptible people into the patient. Since the total number of patient 
is NI(t), there are  λNS(t)I(t) susceptible people infected every week. The 
rate of the dead for each week is μ. The reduction of the susceptible equals to 
the susceptible infected every week，so：

3.1.5 Solution and Result 
After the analysis I0 = 0.000015, S0 = 0.999985.
