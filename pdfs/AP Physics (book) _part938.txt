†Our calculation used numbers rounded off to 3 significant figures. If you keep an extra digit, or leave
the numbers in your calculator, you get 
and 
all within
the expected precision of 3 significant figures (Section 1–4).

Alternate Solution Let us see the effect of choosing a different axis for calcu-
lating torques, such as an axis through the hinge. Then the lever arm for 
is
zero, and the torque equation
becomes
We solve this for 
and find
We get the same result, within the precision of our significant figures.
NOTE It doesn’t matter which axis we choose for
. Using a second axis
can serve as a check.
A More Difficult Example—The Ladder
Ladder. A 5.0-m-long ladder leans against a wall at a point
4.0 m above a cement floor as shown in Fig. 9–11. The ladder is uniform and has
mass
Assuming the wall is frictio
