the process of transpiration. The lower the water
potential in the plantâ€™s surroundings, the more likely the plant is to lose water when its stomata are open.

(c) In looking at the data for the lower surfaces of the leaves of the two species, the 95% confidence intervals
overlap. So one cannot be sure if there is a statistically significant difference between the mean stomatal
densities on the lower surfaces of the leaves of the Passiflora incarnata and Quercus alba. However, the
95% confidence intervals for the upper surfaces of the two species do not overlap. (The lower limit of the
95% confidence interval of Passiflora incarnata is 70 stomata per mm2, and the upper limit of the 95%
confidence interval of Quercus alba is 31 stomata per mm2.) Therefore, there is likely a statistically
significant difference in the mean stomatal densities found on the upper surfaces of the leaves of the two
species.
