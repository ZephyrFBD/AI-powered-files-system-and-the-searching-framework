FIGURE 16–15 The direction of the
static electric force one point charge
exerts on another is always along the
line joining the two charges, and
depends on whether the charges
have the same sign as in (a) and (b),
or opposite signs (c).
†In the once common cgs system of units, k is set equal to 1, and the unit of electric charge is called the
electrostatic unit (esu) or the statcoulomb. One esu is defined as that charge, on each of two point
objects 1 cm apart, that gives rise to a force of 1 dyne.
‡According to the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, subnuclear particles called quarks
have a smaller charge than the electron, equal to
or 
Quarks have not been detected directly as
isolated objects, and theory indicates that free quarks may not be detectable.
