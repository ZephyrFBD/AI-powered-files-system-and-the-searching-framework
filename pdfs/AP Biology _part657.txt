Reabsorption is passive, active, and selective.
Filtration occurs as blood pressure (about twice that of capillaries
outside the kidney) forces fluid from the blood in the glomerulus into
Bowman’s capsule. Specialized cells of Bowman’s capsule are modified
into podocytes, which, along with slit pores, increase the rate of filtration.
Filtration occurs by diffusion and is passive and nonselective. The filtrate
contains everything small enough to diffuse out of the glomerulus and into
Bowman’s capsule, including glucose, salts, vitamins, waste such as urea,
and other small molecules. From Bowman’s capsule, the filtrate travels
into the proximal tubule.
Secretion occurs in the proximal and distal tubules. It is the active,
selective uptake of certain drugs and toxic molecules that did not get
filtered into Bowman’s capsule. The proximal tubule also secretes
ammonia to neutralize the acidic filtrate.
