eces are present from each copy.
The person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller pieces
you see a mountain. In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the
lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in
these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the
principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.
Originally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing
small genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double-
barrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of
each fragment are analyzed for overl
