ould produce larger seeds
than choice (D).
4. (B) Females may pass on sex-linked traits to the next generation through their X chromosomes and nonnuclear
traits through their mitochondrial DNA. Since mitochondrial DNA is passed on through eggs and not sperm,
males cannot pass on nonnuclear traits to the next generation, but females may pass on nonnuclear traits to the
next generation. Therefore, the only true statement is choice (B), and choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect.
5. (D) Phenotypic plasticity describes the ability of two individuals with the same genotype to produce different
phenotypes, depending on the different environmental factors that affect each individual. Choice (A) is incorrect
because sex-linkage involves traits found on the sex chromosomes. Multiple gene inheritance refers to multiple
genes contributing to an individualâ€™s phenotype, so choice (B) is incorrect. Nonnuclear inheritance refers to
traits coded for by genes outside of the nucleus (in the mitochondri
