arily assigning the most abundant form of carbon atom,
the atomic 
mass of exactly 12.0000 unified atomic mass units (u). In terms of kilograms,
The average atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.0079 u, and the values for other 
atoms are as listed in the Periodic Table inside the back cover of this book, and 
also in Appendix B.â€  The molecular mass of a compound is the sum of atomic
masses of the atoms making up the molecules of that compound.
[An element is a substance, such as neon, gold, iron, or copper, that cannot
be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Compounds are
substances made up of elements, and can be broken down into them; examples
are carbon dioxide and water. The smallest piece of an element is an atom; the
smallest piece of a compound is a molecule. Molecules are made up of atoms;
a molecule of water, for example, is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one
of oxygen; its chemical formula is
