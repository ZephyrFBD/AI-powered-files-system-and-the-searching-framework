oplasm.
A transmembrane receptor changes its conformation.
A kinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to another
molecule inside the cell.
An ion channel opens.
Which of the following is correct about chemical signals that bind to
receptors located on the cell membrane, rather than receptors in the
cytoplasm?
They are hydrophobic.
They require a second messenger.
Nitric oxide is one example.
They are oil soluble.
Which of the following is correct about receptors that are located in
the cytoplasm?
They require a second messenger.
One example is the ion-channel receptor.
They bind to hydrophilic substances.
They bind to a signal molecule in the cytoplasm, which causes
a response in the nucleus.
Which of the following most accurately describes the advantage of a
signal transduction pathway?
Transduction can occur in a cascade effect.
The binding of the signaling molecule causes the receptor
protein to change its conformation.
The binding of the signaling molecule with the receptor can
