ported by European settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s. 
When apple trees were first imported into North America, there was no evidence that Rhagoletis could use them 
as hosts. Apples set fruit earlier in the season and develop faster, where hawthorns set later and develop more 
slowly. 
Recent analysis of Rhagoletis populations has shown that two distinct populations of flies have evolved from the 
original ancestral population of flies that were parasitic on hawthorns. One population infests only apple trees, and 
the other infests only hawthorns. The life cycles of both fly populations are coordinated with those of their host trees. 
The flies of each population apparently can distinguish and select mates with similar host preferences and reject 
mates from the population specific to the other host tree. There is very little hybridization (only about 5 percent) 
between the two groups.

Rhagoletis must have occurred very r
