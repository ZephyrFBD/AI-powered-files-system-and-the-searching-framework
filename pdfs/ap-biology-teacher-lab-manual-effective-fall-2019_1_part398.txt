der study? 
•  Did you include a control in your experiment? 
•  What are possible sources of error in the experiment(s)? 
Step 2 Students should make a hypothesis, which should include a prediction about the 
effect of the factor(s) they chose to investigate on the rate of cellular respiration. 
Step 3 Then students conduct their experiment(s) and record data and any answers to 
their questions in their laboratory notebook. 
Step 4 Students should record their data using appropriate methods, such as the example 
table provided in Visuals. They should then graph the results to show the effect of the 
factors/variables they investigated on the rate of cellular respiration. Students should 
calculate the rate(s) of cellular respiration for each factor/variable. 
■ Summative Assessment 
The following are suggested as guidelines to assess students’ understanding of the 
concepts presented in the investigation, but you are encouraged to develop your own 
methods of postlab assessment:
