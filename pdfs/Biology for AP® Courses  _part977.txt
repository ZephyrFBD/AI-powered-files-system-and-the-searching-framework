22. What are the roles of ATP and NADPH in
photosynthesis?
a.
ATP and NADPH are forms of chemical energy
produced from the light dependent reactions to
be used in the light independent reactions that
produce sugars.
b.
ATP and NADPH are forms of chemical energy
produced from the light independent reactions,
to be used in the light dependent reactions that
produce sugars.
c.
ATP and NADPH are forms of chemical energy
produced from the light dependent reactions to
be used in the light independent reactions that
produce proteins.
d.
ATP and NADPH are forms of chemical energy
produced from the light dependent reactions to
be used in the light independent reactions that
use sugars as reactants.
