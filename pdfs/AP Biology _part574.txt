isch is known
for his extensive studies of communication in honeybees and his famous
description of their waggle dance. Niko Tinbergen is known for his
elucidation of the fixed action pattern. Konrad Lorenz is famous for his
work with imprinting.
EVO-1
Innate behaviors are inherited.
As you study each topic, think of how a particular behavior benefits one
animal and makes it more fit than other animals. Also think about how the
behavior enhances the animalâ€™s survival and how the behavior might have
evolved.
FIXED ACTION PATTERN
A fixed action pattern (FAP) is an innate, seemingly highly stereotypic
behavior that once begun is continued to completion, no matter how
useless it is. FAPs are initiated by external stimuli called sign stimuli.
When these stimuli are exchanged between members of the same species,
they are known as releasers. An example of an FAP studied by Tinbergen
involves the stickleback fish, which attacks other males that invade its
territory. The releaser for the attack
