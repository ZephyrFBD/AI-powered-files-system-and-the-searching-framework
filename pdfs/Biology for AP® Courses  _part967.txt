ccessory pigment that absorbs blue and red-orange light and consequently has a yellowish-green tint
organelle in which photosynthesis takes place
group of reversibly oxidizable and reducible proteins that forms part of the electron transport
chain between photosystem II and photosystem I
range of all possible frequencies of radiation
group of proteins between PSII and PSI that pass energized electrons and use the energy
released by the electrons to move hydrogen ions against their concentration gradient into the thylakoid lumen
stack of thylakoids located inside a chloroplast
organism that consumes organic substances or other organisms for food
complex that passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center in each photosystem; it
consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300â€“400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other
pigments like carotenoids
first stage of photosynthesis where certain wavelengths of the visible light are absorbed to
form two energy-carry
