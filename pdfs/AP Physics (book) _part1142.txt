touching, or stretched beyond the elastic region (see Fig. 9–19). Hooke’s law
works not only for springs but for other oscillating solids as well; it thus has wide
applicability, even though it is valid only over a certain range of F and x values.
The proportionality constant k in Eq. 11–1 is called the spring constant for
that particular spring, or its spring stiffness constant
To stretch
the spring a distance x, an (external) force must be exerted on the free end of the
spring with a magnitude at least equal to
[external force on spring]
The greater the value of k, the greater the force needed to stretch a spring a given
distance. That is, the stiffer the spring, the greater the spring constant k.
Note that the force F in Eq. 11–1 is not a constant, but varies with position.
Therefore the acceleration of the mass m is not constant, so we cannot use the
equations for constant acceleration developed in Chapter 2.
