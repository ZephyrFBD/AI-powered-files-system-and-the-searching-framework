ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.P.1
Genetic engineering techniques can be used to 
analyze and manipulate DNA and RNA—
a. Electrophoresis separates molecules 
according to size and charge.
b. During polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
DNA fragments are amplified. 
c. Bacterial transformation introduces DNA into 
bacterial cells.
d. DNA sequencing determines the order of 
nucleotides in a DNA molecule.
X   
EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The details of these 
processes are beyond the scope of this course. The 
focus should be on the conceptual understanding 
of the application of these techniques.
