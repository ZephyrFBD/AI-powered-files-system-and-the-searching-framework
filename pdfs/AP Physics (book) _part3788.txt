te more energy than it radiates? Less
energy? Explain.
3. Describe a red giant star. List some of its properties.
4. Does the Hâ€“R diagram directly reveal anything about the
core of a star?
5. Why do some stars end up as white dwarfs, and others as
neutron stars or black holes?
6. If you were measuring star parallaxes from the Moon
instead of Earth, what corrections would you have to
make? What changes would occur if you were measuring
parallaxes from Mars?
7. Cepheid variable stars change in luminosity with a typical
period of several days. The period has been found to have
a definite relationship with the average intrinsic luminosity
of the star. How could these stars be used to measure the
distance to galaxies?
8. What is a geodesic? What is its role in General Relativity?
9. If it were discovered that the redshift of spectral lines of
galaxies was due to something other than expansion, how
might our view of the universe change? Would there be
conflicting evidence? Discuss.
