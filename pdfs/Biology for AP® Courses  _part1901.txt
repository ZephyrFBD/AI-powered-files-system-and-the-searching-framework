es. The following website uses a software program
called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32blast) .
Under “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.” Input the following sequence into the large "query sequence"
box: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the "Species" field and type "human" or "Homo sapiens".
Then click “BLAST” to compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome.
The result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below
the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits. Pick one
of the hits near the top of the list and click on "Graphics". This will bring you to a page that shows where
the sequence is found within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag
back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your
selected sequence by
