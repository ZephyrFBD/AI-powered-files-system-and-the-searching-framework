(b) What is the emf for this cell when 3Fe3+4 = 3.50 M, P
H2=
0.95 atm, 3Fe2+4 = 0.0010 M, and the pH in both half-cells 
is 4.00?
 20.69  A voltaic cell is constructed with two Zn2+ - Zn elec-
trodes. The two half-cells have 3Zn2+4 = 1.8 M  and 
3Zn2+4 = 1.00 * 10-2 M, respectively. (a) Which electrode 
is the anode of the cell? (b) What is the standard emf of the 
cell? (c) What is the cell emf for the concentrations given? 
(d) For each electrode, predict whether 3Zn2+4 will increase, 
decrease, or stay the same as the cell operates.
 20.70  A voltaic cell is constructed with two silver–silver chlo-
ride electrodes, each of which is based on the following 
half-reaction:
AgCl1s2 + e- ¡ Ag1s2 + Cl-1aq2
The two half-cells have 3Cl-4 = 0.0150 M and 3Cl-4=
2.55 M, respectively. (a) Which electrode is the cathode of 
the cell? (b) What is the standard emf of the cell? (c) What 
is the cell emf for the concentrations given? (d) For each 
electrode, predict whether 3Cl-4 wi
