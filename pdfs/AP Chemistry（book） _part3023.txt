ock is opened, the arrangement in which all the molecules are in the left flask 
is but one of an extremely large number of possible arrangements. The most probable 
arrangements by far are those in which there are essentially equal numbers of molecules 
in the two flasks. When the gas spreads throughout the apparatus, any given molecule 
can be in either flask rather than confined to the left flask. We say that with the stopcock 
opened, the arrangement of gas molecules is more dispersed than when the molecules 
are all confined in the left flask.
We will see that this notion of increasing dispersion helps us understand entropy at 
the molecular level.
Boltzmannâ€™s Equation and Microstates
The science of thermodynamics developed as a means of describing the properties of 
matter in our macroscopic world without regard to microscopic structure. In fact, ther-
modynamics was a well-developed field before the modern view of atomic and molec-
ular structure was even known. The thermodynami
