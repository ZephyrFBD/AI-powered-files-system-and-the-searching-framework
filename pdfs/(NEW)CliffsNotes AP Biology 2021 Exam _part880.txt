e. For the entire line representing
Treatment A on the graph,

29. A. During the interval from 20 to 30 minutes, Treatment C is represented by a horizontal
line with a constant water loss value of 16
 
mL/m2. The total water loss at 20 minutes was 16, and the total water
 
loss at 30 minutes was still 16. So the water loss for this interval was zero.
30. D. The water loss for Treatment C during the first 20 minutes was very high. The wind was apparently
responsible for this high rate of transpiration. As a result, the stomata closed after 20 minutes to prevent further
desiccation. Light intensity and temperature were the same for all treatments so that these variables were not
responsible for the differences observed between the treatments.
31. C. Process I is the splitting of H2O to form O2 and H+.
 
32. B. Proton (H+) concentration and acidity increase in the thylakoid
 
space as a result of the splitting of water on the thylakoid membrane,
 
releasing H+ to the inside of the t
