er 
temperatures there are more open stomata.
(Part b) The student is able to properly draw a curve that 
possesses properly labeled and scaled axes indicating a 
measure of humidity. The student is unable to explain the 
decreasing curve to the fact that increasing humidity leads 
to reduced evaporation rates due to a decreased difference in 
water vapor pressure between the leaf and the atmosphere. 
(Part c) The student can read the graph, a representation of 
the effect of increasing percentage of open stomata per area 
of leaf on the rate of transpiration. The student recognizes 
but is unable to articulate an understanding of the difference 
in rates of transpiration from 0–60 percent open stomata 
compared to 60 percent–100 percent open stomata. The 
student articulates the understanding that as the number  
of open stomata increases, the rate of transpiration increases 
but does not demonstrate the understanding that the rate of 
diffusion between the leaf interior and the envir
