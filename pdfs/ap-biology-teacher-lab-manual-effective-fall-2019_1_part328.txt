• 5% ovalbumin (egg white protein) 
•  1 M sucrose 
• 20 cm-long dialysis tubing 
•  1 M NaCl 
• Cups 
•  1 M glucose 
• Balances 
•  How can you use weights of the filled cell models to determine the rate and direction 
of diffusion? What would be an appropriate control for the procedure you just 
described? 
•  Suppose you could test other things besides weights of the dialysis tubes. How could 
you determine the rates and directions of diffusion of water, sucrose, NaCl, glucose, 
and ovalbumin? 
•  Will protein diffuse? Will it affect the rate of diffusion of other molecules? 
Step 1 Choose up to four pairs of different solutions. One solution from each pair will be 
in the model cell of dialysis tubing, and the other will be outside the cell in the cup. Your 
fifth model cell will have water inside and outside; this is your control. Before starting, 
use your knowledge about solute gradients to predict whether the water will diffuse into 
or out of the cell. Make sure you label
