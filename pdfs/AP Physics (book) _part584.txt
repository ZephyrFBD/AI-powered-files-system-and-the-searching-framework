6–3 Kinetic Energy, and 
the Work-Energy Principle
Energy is one of the most important concepts in science. Yet we cannot give a
simple general definition of energy in only a few words. Nonetheless, each specific
type of energy can be defined fairly simply. In this Chapter we define translational
kinetic energy and some types of potential energy. In later Chapters, we will examine
other types of energy, such as that related to heat and electricity. The crucial
aspect of energy is that the sum of all types, the total energy, is the same after 
any process as it was before: that is, energy is a conserved quantity.
For the purposes of this Chapter, we can define energy in the traditional way
as “the ability to do work.” This simple definition is not always applicable,† but it
is valid for mechanical energy which we discuss in this Chapter. We now define
and discuss one of the basic types of energy, kinetic energy.
