some inactivation can be seen in the genetics of the
female calico cat where the alleles for black and yellow fur are carried on
the X chromosome. Male cats, having only a single X chromosome, can be
either yellow (XYY) or black (XBY). Calico cats, which are almost always
female, have coats with patches of both yellow and black (XBXY). These
patches of fur developed from embryonic cells with different deactivated
X chromosomes. Some fur-producing cells contained the XB active
chromosome and produce black fur. Other fur-producing cells contain the
XY active chromosome and produce yellow fur. The result is a cat with
yellow and black patches of fur, the characteristic calico appearance. See
Figure 8.8.
Figure 8.8 X Inactivation in Calico Cats
Another example of X chromosome inactivation is evident in humans.
A certain X-linked recessive mutation prevents the development of sweat
glands. A woman who is heterozygous for this trait is not merely a carrier.
Because of X inactivation, she has
