ntains ribose and uracil and is single-
stranded. However, remember that viruses, unlike organisms, can have
double- or single-stranded DNA or RNA.
In the DNA double helix, sugars and phosphate form the backbone and
the nitrogenous bases of each strand extend inward and are bound by
base pairing rules (adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine). The
two strands in a DNA double helix are antiparallel (run in opposite
directions). Directionality determines how complementary nucleotides
are added during DNA synthesis and the direction in which DNA is
transcribed to RNA (from 5’ to 3’). RNA occurs in diﬀerent forms including
messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA.

Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon. All
living matter is made up of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
phosphorus, and sulfur (N’CHOPS).
