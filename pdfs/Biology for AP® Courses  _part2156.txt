.
Another cause of nonrandom mating is physical location. This is especially true in large populations spread over large
geographic distances where not all individuals will have equal access to one another. Some might be miles apart through
woods or over rough terrain, while others might live immediately nearby.
Environmental Variance
Genes are not the only players involved in determining population variation. Phenotypes are also influenced by other
factors, such as the environment (Figure 19.7). For example, sun exposure is an environmental factor, as a person who
spends more time in the sun will likely have darker skin than a person who spends most of their time indoors (assuming both
people had similarly-colored skin to start with). Some major characteristics, such as sex, are determined by the environment
for some species. For example, some turtles and other reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). TSD
means that individuals develop into males if their eggs are
