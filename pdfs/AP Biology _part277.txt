In this experiment, the actual results do not conform to either prediction.
The reason is that the genes for body color and wing size are located on
the same chromosome. They are linked, although not permanently. The
existence of small numbers of nonparental phenotypes (shaded in) can be
explained only by an occasional break in the linkage—where crossover
occurred. Remember that crossing-over accounts for the recombination of
linked genes. Here is how to determine recombination frequency given
data such as this.
Determining Recombination Frequencies
Use the following formula to calculate recombination frequencies
Number of recombinantsTotal number ofspring×100
Use the results from the cross above.
Number of recombinants: 206 + 185 = 391
Total number of offspring: 965 + 944 + 206 + 185 = 2300
