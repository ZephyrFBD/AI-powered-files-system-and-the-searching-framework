 is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? In these cases, you need to know the
number of individuals with each genotype to find the allele frequencies. You cannot use the Hardy-Weinberg
equations in these situations, but you can add up the alleles contributed by each genotype to the gene pool of
the population. Here is an example.
In a nonrandomly mating population of 80 individuals, 10 have the homozygous dominant genotype, 46
are heterozygous, and 24 have the homozygous recessive genotype for a particular trait. What are the allele
frequencies for this trait in this population?
Since there are 80 individuals in the population and each individual contributes two alleles for the trait to
the population, there are a total of 80 × 2 = 160 alleles for the trait in this population. Each homozygous
dominant individual contributes two copies of the dominant allele to the population for a total of 10 × 2 = 20
dominant alleles. Each heterozygous individual contributes one copy of the dominant all
