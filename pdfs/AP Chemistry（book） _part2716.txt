ong base, and (3) polyprotic acid–strong base. We will also briefly consider 
how these curves relate to those involving weak bases.
Strong Acid–Strong Base Titrations
The titration curve produced when a strong base is added to a strong acid has the gen-
eral shape shown in Figure 17.7, which depicts the pH change that occurs as 0.100 M 
NaOH is added to 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl. The pH can be calculated at various stages 
of the titration. To help understand these calculations, we can divide the curve into 
four regions:
 1. Initial pH: The pH of the solution before the addition of any base is deter-
mined by the initial concentration of the strong acid. For a solution of 
0.100 M HCl, 3H+4 = 0.100 M and pH = -log10.1002 = 1.000. Thus, the initial 
pH is low.
 2. Between initial pH and equivalence point: As NaOH is added, the pH 
increases slowly at first and then rapidly in the vicinity of the equivalence point.
