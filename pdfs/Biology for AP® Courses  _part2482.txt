mas, Nitrobacter, and Nitrospira. The bacteria performs the reverse process, the
reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N2O, NO, and N2, a process called denitrification.

Which of the following statements about the nitrogen cycle is false?
a.
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria exist on the root nodules of legumes and in the soil.
b.
Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates (NO3-) into nitrogen gas (N2).
c.
Ammonification is the process by which ammonium ion (NH4+) is released from decomposing organic
compounds.
d.
Nitrification is the process by which nitrites (NO2-) are converted to ammonium ion (NH4+).
