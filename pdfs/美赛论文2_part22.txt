edication in the epidemic area at time t. 
3.4.2 Assumptions 
1) L&K are constant, which means that the labor force and capital stay 
unchanged. 
2) α&βare constant, which means the weight of labor force and capital in 
the production process is always stable. 
3) One production process continues for one week. 
3.4.3 The Foundation of Model 
We divide the whole produce process into four stages. In stageⅠ, Y grows 
with high-increasing speed due to the high development of technology. In 
stageⅡ, Y grows with low-increasing speed due to the speed of technology 
development slows down as a result of some constraints. Due to the 
constraints, Y finally becomes stable in StageⅢ( Now we suppose that Y is 
still less than D at the end of StageⅡ, if Y>D at that time, StageⅢcan be 
deleted ). StageⅣ: Y declines due to the decreasing demand of the medication 
declines. The demand of the medication in the epidemic area at time t is 
decided by the improved modelⅡ . 
StageⅠ:Y grows with high-incre
