the two together, we get a resultant force
1.4 N as shown in Fig. 9–3b.
We assume that the tooth is in equilibrium because the gums exert a nearly
equal magnitude force in the opposite direction. Actually that is not quite so
since the objective is to move the tooth ever so slowly.
NOTE If the wire is firmly attached to the tooth, the tension to the right, say,
can be made larger than that to the left, and the resultant force would corre-
spondingly be directed more toward the right.

The First Condition for Equilibrium
For an object to be at rest, Newton’s second law tells us that the sum of the forces
acting on it must add up to zero. Since force is a vector, the components of the
net force must each be zero. Hence, a condition for equilibrium is that
(9;1)
We will mainly be dealing with forces that act in a plane, so we usually need only
the x and y components. We must remember that if a particular force component
points along the
