 are closer in their evolutionary history.
(C)
This option is correct. It demonstrates the ability to select the phylogenetic 
tree that correctly represents evolutionary history and speciation from the 
data set. The data indicate that species 5 is not closely related to the others 
and that 3 and 4 are very closely related. This cladogram incorporates those 
differences as well as the close relationship between 1 and 2.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The nucleotide differences in species 2 are closer to 
species 1, and this representation indicates they are linked evolutionarily to all the 
other species.
