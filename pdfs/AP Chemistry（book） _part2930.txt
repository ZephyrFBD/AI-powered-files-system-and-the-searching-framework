CHAPTER 18 Chemistry of the Environment
18.5 ∣ Green Chemistry
The planet on which we live is, to a large extent, a closed system, one that exchanges 
energy but not matter with its surroundings. If humankind is to thrive in the future, all 
the processes we carry out should be in balance with Earth’s natural processes and phys-
ical resources. This goal requires that no toxic materials be released to the environment, 
that our needs be met with renewable resources, and that we consume the least possible 
amount of energy. Although the chemical industry is but a small part of human activity, 
chemical processes are involved in nearly all aspects of modern life. Chemistry is there-
fore at the heart of efforts to accomplish these goals.
Green chemistry is an initiative that pr
