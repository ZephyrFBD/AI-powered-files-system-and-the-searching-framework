 in the past, and at the
same rate, supported Darwin’s hypothesis of
natural selection because humans could select
for desirable traits and produce change very
rapidly, so natural selection would also be fast
enough to produce the full range of diversity in
living organisms.
b.
The idea that the same processes that operate in
the present also operated in the past, and at the
same rate, connects to Darwin’s hypothesis of
natural selection because he had observed it
happening in the present
c.
The idea that geologic change is the result of
slow, continuous processes rather than sudden,
substantial change connects to Darwin’s support
of gradualism rather than punctuated equilibrium
as the process that guided evolution.
d.
The idea that geologic change is the result of
slow, continuous processes rather than sudden,
substantial change connects directly to Darwin’s
hypothesis that, given enough time, slow and
subtle processes could produce substantial
biological change.
