Vectors can be added more accurately by adding their
components along chosen axes with the aid of trigonometric
functions. A vector of magnitude V making an angle with the
axis has components

Given the components, we can find a vector’s magnitude and
direction from

Projectile motion is the motion of an object in the air near the
Earth’s surface under the effect of gravity alone. It can be analyzed
as two separate motions if air resistance can be ignored. The hori-
zontal component of motion is at constant velocity, whereas the
vertical component is at constant acceleration,
just as for an
object falling vertically under the action of gravity.
The velocity of an object relative to one frame of refer-
ence can be found by vector addition if its velocity relative to a
second frame of reference, and the relative velocity of the two
reference frames, are known.
