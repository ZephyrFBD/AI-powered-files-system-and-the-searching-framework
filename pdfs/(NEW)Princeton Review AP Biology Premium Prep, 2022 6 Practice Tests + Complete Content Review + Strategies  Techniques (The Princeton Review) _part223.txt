ases, however, enzyme denaturation is reversible if the original optimal environmental
conditions of the enzyme are restored. This allows the enzyme to regain its activity and function.
Break Down Words
To denature is to “unnature” something, to change its nature, or to remove the
characteristics that make it unique. Without proper and special folding, a
protein loses its nature.
Here’s one thing to remember: all enzymes operate at an ideal temperature. For most human enzymes, this
temperature is body temperature, 37°C.
Not all organisms have a constant body temperature. For example, ectotherms depend on the environment to control
their varying body temperatures. Q10 is a measure of temperature sensitivity of a physiological process or enzymatic
reaction rate. The equation for Q10 is included on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet.
The temperature unit must be in either Celsius or Kelvin, and the same unit must be used for T1 and T2. The two
reaction rates (k1 and k2) must also
