temperature. (b) No, molality does 
not change with change in temperature. 13.11 The volume inside the 
balloon will be 0.5 L, assuming perfect osmosis across the semiperme-
able membrane. 13.13 (a) False (b) false (c) true 13.15 (a) Dispersion
(b) hydrogen bonding (c) ion–dipole (d) dipole–dipole 13.17 Very 
soluble (b) ∆Hmix will be the largest negative number. In order for 
∆Hsoln to be negative, the magnitude of ∆Hmix must be greater than 
the magnitude of (∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent). 13.19 (a) ∆Hsolute (b) ∆Hmix 
13.21 (a) ∆Hsoln is nearly zero. Since the solute and solvent experi-
ence very similar London dispersion forces, the energy required to 
separate them individually and the energy released when they are 
mixed are approximately equal. ∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent ≈- ∆Hmix.  
(b) The entropy of the system increases when heptane and hexane 
form a solution. From part (a), the enthalpy of mixing is nearly zero, 
so the increase in entropy is the driving force for mixing in all propor-
