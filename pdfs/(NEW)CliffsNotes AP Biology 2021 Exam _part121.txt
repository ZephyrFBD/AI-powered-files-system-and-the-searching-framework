ause during the reaction some energy will be lost as heat (as entropy increases).
The value of ΔG can be negative or positive:
When Δ G is negative for a reaction, there is a net release of free energy. This reaction is said to be exergonic and
can occur spontaneously (that is, without an input of energy). For the process of respiration, for example, the
breakdown of glucose to CO2 and H2O, ΔG = −686 kcal/mol:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O
 
When Δ G is positive for a reaction, free energy must be added to the reaction for it to occur. This reaction is said to
be endergonic. For the process of photosynthesis, for example, the making of
glucose from CO2 and H2O, ΔG = +686 kcal/mol:
 
6 CO2 + 6 H2O → C6H12O6 + 6 O2
Note that the overall equation for photosynthesis is the reverse of that for respiration. But because ΔG is positive for
photosynthesis, the reaction cannot occur spontaneously and energy, at least equal to ΔG, must be provided for the
reaction to occur. This energy comes fro
