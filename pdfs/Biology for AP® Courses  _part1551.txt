Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide
sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or
spontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other
environmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of
natural reactions taking place within the body.
Mutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point
mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions,
