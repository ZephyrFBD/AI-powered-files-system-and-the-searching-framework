 not accessible to plants). Many
plants respond to these conditions by shutting down photosynthesis and dropping leaves. Before leaves are released,
however, valuable resources are withdrawn. The changing colors of leaves in the fall result from the sequential
breakdown of pigments, beginning with chlorophyll. Additional preparation for dormancy includes protecting apical
meristems in buds with bud scales. Because it is a periodic occurrence, the approach of winter is determined by
measuring changes in the length of daylight (see “Photoperiodism and Flowering,” below).
Seed dormancy is a mechanism that allows seeds to delay germination until conditions for growth are optimal. A
seed contains an embryo and stored food with very little water. The absence of water arrests metabolic activity and
maintains the inactive dormant condition. A tough seed coat protects the embryo and nutritive material from assault
by microbes or other organisms.
