19.7  The accompanying diagram shows how ∆H (red line) 
and T∆S (blue line) change with temperature for a 
hypothetical reaction. (a) What is the significance 
of the point at 300 K, where ∆H and T∆S are equal? 
(b) In what temperature range is this reaction sponta-
neous? [Section 19.6]

and B, each at 1 atm, and on the right is the pure product, 
C, also at 1 atm. Indicate whether each of the following 
statements is true or false. (a) The minimum of the graph 
corresponds to the equilibrium mixture of reactants and 
products for this reaction. (b) At equilibrium, all of A and B 
have reacted to give pure C. (c) The entropy c
