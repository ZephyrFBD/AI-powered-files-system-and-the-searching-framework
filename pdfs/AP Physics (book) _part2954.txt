e to Earth, using the relativistic Eq. 26–10 because the
speeds are high and they are along the same line.
SOLUTION Rocket 2 moves with speed 
with respect to rocket 1.
Rocket 1 has speed
with respect to Earth. The speed of rocket 2 with
respect to Earth is (Eq. 26–10)
NOTE The speed of rocket 2 relative to Earth is less than c, as it must be.
We can see that Eq. 26–10 reduces to the classical form for velocities small
compared to the speed of light since
for v and
Thus,
as in classical physics (Chapter 3).
Let us test our formula at the other extreme, that of the speed of light.
Suppose that rocket 1 in Fig. 26–11 sends out a beam of light so that 
Equation 26–10 tells us that the speed of this light relative to Earth is
which is fully consistent with the second postulate of relativity.
EXERCISE E Use Eq. 26–10 to calculate the speed of rocket 2 in Fig. 26–11 relative to
Earth if it was shot from rocket 1 at a speed
Assume rocket 1
had a speed
