traits in the two populations. Genetic drift may also cause differences in allele frequencies, either because of the
founder effect, or because either (or both) new population is small. In these two cases, allele frequencies are strongly
influenced by chance (genetic drift). Also, mutations in one population may introduce new alleles absent in the other
population, thus providing new variation upon which natural selection can act.
b. The defining characteristic of sympatric speciation is that it occurs in the absence of a geographic barrier that
would isolate one or more groups of individuals. Instead, reproductive isolation occurs as a result of one of several
other causes. Polyploidy, for example, creates reproductive isolation in a single generation. As a result of
nondisjunction during meiosis, gametes contain all of the chromosomes instead of half of them. If such a gamete is
fertilized by a similar gamete, then the resulting zygote has twice the number of chromosomes and is
