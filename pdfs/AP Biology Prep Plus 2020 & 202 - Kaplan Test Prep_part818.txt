duce many oﬀspring quickly. These
species are called r-selected, or r-strategists, because their strategy is to
increase their r-value. Species that are r-strategists generally have short
life spans, begin breeding early in life, and produce large numbers of
oﬀspring.
Density-independent factors aﬀect populations in the same
way regardless of how many individuals are in the population
at that given time. These factors tend to be more catastrophic,
abiotic factors, such as flood, drought, hurricane, or fire.
The impact of density-dependent factors on populations
increases as the number of individuals in the population, and
therefore the density in a given area, increases. These factors
include variables such as competition among or between
species, predation, or emigration.
Species in more stable environments tend to produce fewer oﬀspring and
invest more resources into the success of each oﬀspring. These species
are called K-selected, or K-strategists. K-strategists have longer life
