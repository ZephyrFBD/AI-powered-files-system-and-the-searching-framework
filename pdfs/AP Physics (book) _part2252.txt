form circles around the wire, and the field exerts a force on
magnets (or currents) near it.
A magnetic field exerts a force on an electric current. For
a straight wire of length 
carrying a current I, the force has
magnitude
(20;1)
where is the angle between the magnetic field 
and the cur-
rent direction. The direction of the force is perpendicular to the
current-carrying wire and to the magnetic field, and is given 
by a right-hand rule. Equation 20â€“1 serves as the definition of
magnetic field 
Similarly, a magnetic field exerts a force on a charge q
moving with velocity of magnitude
(20;3)
where 
is the angle between 
and 
The direction of

perpendicular to 
and to 
(again a right-hand rule). The 
path of a charged particle moving perpendicular to a uniform
magnetic field is a circle.
The magnitude of the magnetic field produced by a cur-
rent I in a long straight wire, at a distance r from the wire, is
