tions (Section 31–1); these are said to be produced “artificially”
and to have “artificial radioactivity.” Radioactive isotopes are sometimes referred
to as radioisotopes or radionuclides.
Rutherford and others began studying the nature of the rays emitted in
radioactivity about 1898. They classified the rays into three distinct types accord-
ing to their penetrating power. One type of radiation could barely penetrate a
piece of paper. The second type could pass through as much as 3 mm of aluminum.
The third was extremely penetrating: it could pass through several centimeters 
of lead and still be detected on the other side. They named these three types of
radiation alpha 
beta 
and gamma 
respectively, after the first three
letters of the Greek alphabet.
