lts, which are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Thus, the bile
salts hydrophilic side can interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. By
doing so, bile salts emulsify large lipid globules into small lipid globules.
Why is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that
break down lipids). If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available
for the lipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface
area of the lipids many fold. The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed in
Figure 25.19. Lipases break down the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. These molecules can pass through the plasma
membrane of the cell and enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal
