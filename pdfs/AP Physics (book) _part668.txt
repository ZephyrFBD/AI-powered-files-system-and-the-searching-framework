Problem 44.
45. (III) A cyclist intends to cycle up a 7.50° hill whose vertical
height is 125 m. The pedals turn in a circle of diameter
36.0 cm. Assuming the mass of bicycle plus person is
75.0 kg, (a) calculate how much work must be done against
gravity. (b) If each complete revolution of the pedals
moves the bike 5.10 m along its path, calculate the average
force that must be exerted on the pedals tangent to their
circular path. Neglect work done by friction and other
losses.

46. (I) Two railroad cars, each of mass 66,000 kg, are traveling
toward each other. They collide head-on and come
to rest. How much thermal energy is produced in this 
collision?
