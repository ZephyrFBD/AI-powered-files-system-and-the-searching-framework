ntervals determined by the real zeros. 
4. Make a Table or Diagram. Use test values to make a table or diagram of the signs of 
each factor in each interval. In the last row of the table determine the sign of the 
polynomial on that interval. 
5. Solve. Determine the solutions of the inequality from the last row of the table. Check 
whether the endpoints of these intervals satisfy the inequality. (This may happen if the 
inequality involves ≤ or ≥.)

1.9.2 Rational Inequalities 
1. Move All Terms to One Side. Rewrite the inequality so that all nonzero terms appear 
on one side of the inequality symbol. Bring all quotients to a common denominator. 
2. Factor Numerator and Denominator. Factor the numerator and denominator into 
irreducible factors, and then find the cut points. 
3. Find the Intervals. List the intervals determined by the cut points.
