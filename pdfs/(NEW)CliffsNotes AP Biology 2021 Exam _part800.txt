ses or to various organs
(root, shoot, and leaf growth and reproductive organs). Also consider how biomass varies as a function of wet mass
and how that might influence energy flow to herbivores.
Investigation 11: Transpiration
Transpiration is the evaporation of water from plants. Differences in water potential move water from the soil to the
leaves. From leaves (and, less so, other plant parts), water evaporates mostly through the stomata.
Review these properties of water potential:
1. Water moves across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower
water potential.
 
2. Water potential can be positive or negative. Negative water potential is called tension.
 
3. In a living cell, water potential is always zero or negative.
4. Solute potential (osmotic potential) results from the presence of solutes and is always negative. A higher
concentration of solutes generates a more negative solute potential.
5. Pressure potential is zero unless so
