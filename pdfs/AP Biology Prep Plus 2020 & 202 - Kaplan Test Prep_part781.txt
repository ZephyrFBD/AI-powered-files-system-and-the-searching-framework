, coordinate group behavior,
and care for young. The following examples illustrate communication in
organisms. Male lizards use visual signals to show their territorial
dominance by standing up high oﬀ the ground and swallowing air to
increase their size. Frogs and toads produce auditory signals to attract
mates, and the bright colors of toxic species warn predators not to eat
them. On the other hand, the bright coloration of flowers and fruits signal

animals to pollinate their flowers or disperse their fruits. Honeybees use
tactile signals to communicate the location of nectar sources via a waggle
dance, and minnows release an alarm pheromone when their skin is
damaged to warn other minnows of a predatory fish.
