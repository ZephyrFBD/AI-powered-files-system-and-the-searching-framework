d 20 beans of a second color (foxes).  
•  Mix the bean populations thoroughly, and randomly  
spread the beans around on the board. (Let students  
determine how to randomly distribute their beans.)  
Apply the rules of FOXRAB. 
1. Rabbits reproduce (births): When a rabbit lands on a  
dark blue square, add a rabbit.  
2. Foxes die (deaths): When a fox lands on white square, remove it. 
3. If a fox lands in a patch of four (outlined in green border) with a rabbit, then remove 
the rabbit (death), and add a fox (birth). 
4. Count the new number of foxes and rabbits after these three steps. 
5. For the next generation, remove all beans, mix the surviving beans thoroughly 
together, and then randomly spread the beans around on the board again. 
6. Repeat (iterate) this procedure numerous times to represent new generations.
