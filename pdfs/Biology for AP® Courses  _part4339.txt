 remaining from the original 1000
sheep. This number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand.
mortality rate = 12
776 x 1000 â‰ˆ 15.5
As can be seen from the mortality rate data (column D), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12
months old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors. The data indicate
that if a sheep in this population were to survive to age one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as
shown by the life expectancy numbers in column E.
