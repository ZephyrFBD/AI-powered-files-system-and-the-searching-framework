stify scientific arguments  
using evidence.
Students should be able to write and evaluate scientific 
descriptions, explanations, and theories that describe 
biological phenomena and processes. Students 
should be able to call upon current knowledge and 
historical experiments and draw inferences from 
their explorations to justify claims with evidence. For 
example, students should cite evidence drawn from 
the different scientific disciplines that support natural 
selection and evolution, such as the geological record, 
antibiotic resistance in bacteria, herbicide resistance 
inÂ plants, or how a population bottleneck changes 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Essential skills include 
the ability to analyze, interpret, and make predictions 
from a model or the data obtained in an experiment and 
the ability to justify the reasoning for a prediction and/
or explanation. For example, when given a sequence 
of DNA containing a designated mutational change, 
students can predict the effect of
