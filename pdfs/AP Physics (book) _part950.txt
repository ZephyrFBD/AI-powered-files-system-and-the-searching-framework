g examples. A ball suspended freely from a string is in
stable equilibrium, for if it is displaced to one side, it will return to its original
position (Fig. 9–15a) due to the net force and torque exerted on it. On the other
hand, a pencil standing on its point is in unstable equilibrium. If its center of grav-
ity is directly over its tip (Fig.9–15b), the net force and net torque on it will be zero.
But if it is displaced ever so slightly as shown—say, by a slight vibration or tiny air
current—there will be a torque on it, and this torque acts to make the pencil continue
to fall in the direction of the original displacement. Finally, an example of an object
in neutral equilibrium is a sphere resting on a horizontal tabletop. If it is moved
slightly to one side, it will remain in its new position—no net torque acts on it.
