iversity of Bonn in Germany pursuing
the question of whether we live in a simulation. They concluded that
we probably do and it was likely based on a laĴice of cubes. They
found that cosmic rays align with that speciﬁc paĴern. The team
highlighted the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit which refers
to cosmic ray particle interaction with cosmic background radiation
that creates an apparent boundary for cosmic ray particles. They say
in a paper entitled ‘Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical
Simulation’ that this ‘paĴern of constraint’ is exactly what you
would ﬁnd with a computer simulation. They also made the point
that a simulation would create its own ‘laws of physics’ that would
limit possibility. I’ve been making the same point for decades that
the perceived laws of physics relate only to this reality, or what I
would later call the simulation. When designers write codes to create
computer and virtual reality games they are the equivalent of the
laws of physics for that game
