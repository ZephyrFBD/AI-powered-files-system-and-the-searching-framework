The lengths 
are chosen small enough so that 
is essen-
tially constant along each length. The sum must be made over a closed path, and
is the total net current enclosed by this closed path.

AMPÈRE’S LAW
Field Due to a Straight Wire
We can check Ampère’s law by applying it to the simple case of a long straight
wire carrying a current I. Let us find the magnitude of B at point P, a distance r
from the wire in Fig. 20–31. The magnetic field lines are circles with the wire at
their center (as in Fig. 20–8). As the path to be used in Eq. 20–9, we choose a
convenient one: a circle of radius r, because at any point on this path,
will be
tangent to this circle. For any short segment of the circle (Fig. 20–31),
will be
parallel to that segment, so
Suppose we break the circular path down
into 100 segments.† Then Ampère’s law
