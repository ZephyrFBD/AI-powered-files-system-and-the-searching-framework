id-in and free-response questions on
your exam. Let’s look at two ways we can analyze sets of data.
You could use diﬀerent descriptive statistics such as mean, median,
range, and standard deviation to describe your populations of study. Let’s
take a look at a couple of these descriptive statistics. The equation for
solving for standard deviation S is:
where xi is each data point, x
̅  is the mean of the data points, and n is
equal to the size of the sample. The standard deviation calculates the
diﬀerence between each of your data points and the mean value of your
data, allowing you to see how much variability there is in the population.
For each set of data, you will construct a histogram. A histogram is a
graphical representation of the distribution of the data. Using your
histograms and other statistical analyses, such as a t-test or chi-square
test, you can determine the validity of the diﬀerences in the populations.
The formula for a chi-square test is:
where o is the number of ind
