res, and climate change. Communities
with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium. Following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the
equilibrium state.
Succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time. In primary
succession, newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an
ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain.
Primary Succession and Pioneer Species
Primary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed: for example, following the eruption of volcanoes,
such as those on the Big Island of Hawaii. As lava flows into the ocean, new land is continually being formed. On the
Big Island, approximately 32 acres of land is added each year. First, weathering and other natural forces break down the
substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements, known as pioneer
