BASED, STUDENT-DIRECTED INVESTIGATION? 
Before students attempt this investigation, they should be able to demonstrate 
understanding of the following concepts. The concepts may have been taught at different 
times of the year, but they give a conceptual understanding that could help students 
formulate questions related to the behavior of Drosophila. 
•  An insect life cycle that includes a complete metamorphosis   
(egg, larva, pupa, and adult)  
•  The role of apoptosis in metamorphosis 
•  The genetic basis of behavior and role of a taxis 
•  The types of environmental factors that trigger a behavior 
•  The generalized structure of sensory organs and neurons 
■ Skills Development 
Students will develop the following skills and reinforce their observation skills. They 
may have worked with fruit flies in previous investigations, so they may be familiar with
