(a) Refine the student’s model by placing “Lys” at the correct position on the phylogenetic tree to indicate 
where the Arg-to-Lys mutation most likely occurred. Provide ONE piece of reasoning to support your 
placement of “Lys” on the phylogenetic tree. 
(b) Predict the most likely single mutation affecting amino acid 104 in the species and justify how  
β-hemoglobin can function normally in all four species despite the mutation.
