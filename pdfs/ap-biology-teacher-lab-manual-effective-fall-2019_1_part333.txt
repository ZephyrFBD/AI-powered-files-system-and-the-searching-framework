tested diffusion and osmosis properties of several solutions. 
Now you are going to determine how they affect plant cell turgor pressure. 
•  What changes do you expect to see when the cells are exposed to the solutions?  
•  How will you know if a particular treatment is increasing turgor pressure? If it is 
reducing turgor pressure? 
•  How could you determine which solution is isotonic to the cells? 
Step 2 Test one of the four solutions from Procedure 2 and find out if what you predicted 
is what happens. When you are done, ask other students what they saw. Be sure to record 
all of your procedures, calculations, and observations. 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
Materials 
•  Potatoes, sweet potatoes, or yams 
•  Cork borers or french fry cutter 
•  Balances 
•  Metric rulers 
• Cups 
• Color-coded sucrose solutions of  
different, but unlabeled, concentrations 
prepared by your teacher 
Design an experiment to identify the concentrations of the sucrose solutions an
