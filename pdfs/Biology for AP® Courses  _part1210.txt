 she produces some offspring asexually in a process called parthenogenesis. These offspring, which are destined
to become new queens, are not fertilized by the king. They are genetic clones of the queen. More information about
parthenogenesis in these termites can be found at this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32termitequeen) .

11.1 | The Process of Meiosis
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How do chromosomes behave during meiosis?
•
What cellular events occur during meiosis?
•
What are the similarities and differences between meiosis and mitosis?
•
How can the process of meiosis generate genetic variation?
Connection for AP® Courses
As we explored the cell cycle and mitosis in a previous chapter, we learned that cells divide to grow, replace other cells,
and reproduce asexually. Without mutation, or changes in the DNA, the daughter cells produced by mitosis receive a set of
genetic instructions that is
