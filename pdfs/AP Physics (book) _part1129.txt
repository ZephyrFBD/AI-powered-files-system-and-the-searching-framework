General Problems
85. A ship, carrying fresh water to a desert island in the Carib-
bean, has a horizontal cross-sectional area of 
at
the waterline. When unloaded, the ship rises 8.25 m higher
in the sea. How much water 
was delivered?
86. A raft is made of 12 logs lashed together. Each is 45 cm in
diameter and has a length of 6.5 m. How many people can
the raft hold before they start getting their feet wet, assuming
the average person has a mass of 68 kg? Do not neglect the
weight of the logs. Assume the specific gravity of wood is
0.60.
87. Estimate the total mass of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, using
the known value of atmospheric pressure at sea level.

Fluids
88. During each heartbeat, approximately 
of blood is
pushed from the heart at an average pressure of 105 mm-Hg.
Calculate the power output of the heart, in watts, assuming
70 beats per minute.
89. Four lawn sprinkler heads are fed by a 1.9-cm-diameter
pipe. The water comes out of the heads at an angl
