 increase in the mass of producers. This model is
also called the trophic cascade model. An excellent example is what
happened in Yellowstone Park. The U.S. National Park Service
exterminated the wolf population in the park in 1926, but reintroduced
them in the 1990s after public sentiment shifted. During the years when
there were no wolves, the aspen tree population in the park decreased from
6% to 1% because of intense browsing by Rocky Mountain elk. When
wolves were reintroduced into the park, the aspen trees looked healthier
and their density increased substantially. Presumably this resulted from the
top-down pressure on the elk population by the wolf population.
Biological Magnification
Organisms at higher trophic levels have greater concentrations of
accumulated toxins stored in their bodies than those at lower trophic
levels. This phenomenon is called biological magnification. The bald
