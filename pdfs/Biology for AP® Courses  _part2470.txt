photosynthetic prokaryotes and
eukaryotic chloroplasts.
Think About It
What features and metabolic processes do all cells, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, have in common? How do
prokaryotes and eukaryotes differ?
22.3 | Prokaryotic Metabolism
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are examples of macronutrients needs by prokaryotes, and what is their importance?
•
How do prokaryotes obtain free energy and carbon for life processes?
•
What are the roles of prokaryotes in the carbon and nitrogen cycles?
Connection for AP® Courses
Because prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms, they can flourish in many different environments using a wide
