air, each chlorine atom has eight electrons (an octet) 
in its valence shell, thus achieving the noble-gas electron configuration of argon.
The structures shown here for H2 and Cl2 are Lewis structures, or Lewis dot struc-
tures. While these structures show circles to indicate electron sharing, the more common 
convention is to show each shared electron pair or bonding pair, as a line and any 
unshared electron pairs (also called lone pairs or nonbonding pairs) as dots. Written 
this way, the Lewis structures for H2 and Cl2 are

For nonmetals, the number of valence electrons in a neutral atom is the same as 
the group number. Therefore, one might predict that 7A elements, such as F, would 
form one covalent bond to achieve an octet; 6A elements, such as O, would form two 
covalent bonds; 5A elements, such as N, would form three; and 4A elements, such as 
C, would form four. These predictions are borne out in many compounds, as in, for 
example, the compounds with hydrogen of t
