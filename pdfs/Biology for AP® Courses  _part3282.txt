b.
Peppers contain capsaicin, which opens the same
calcium channels as warm receptors. Excess
stimulation gives the perception of pain. Thus
people who can tolerate more heat find peppers
to be less painful.
c.
Peppers contain quinine, which opens the same
calcium channels as warm receptors. Excess
stimulation gives the perception of pain. Thus
people who can tolerate more heat find peppers
to be less painful.
d.
Peppers contain quinine, which opens the same
sodium channels as warm receptors. Excess
stimulation gives the perception of pain. Thus
people who can tolerate more heat find peppers
to be less painful.
