Resolution of Telescopes and Microscopes; the 
Limit

†Earth-bound telescopes with large-diameter objectives are usually limited not by diffraction but by
other effects such as turbulence in the atmosphere. The resolution of a high-quality microscope, on
the other hand, normally is limited by diffraction; microscope objectives are complex compound
lenses containing many elements of small diameter (since f is small), thus reducing aberrations.

radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto
Rico, uses radio waves (Fig. 22–8)
instead of visible light.
