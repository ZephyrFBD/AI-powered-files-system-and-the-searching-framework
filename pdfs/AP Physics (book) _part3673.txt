y. At first it was not universally
accepted that these objects were extragalactic—that is, outside our Galaxy. But
the very large telescopes constructed in the twentieth century revealed that
individual stars could be resolved within these extragalactic objects and that many
contain spiral arms. Edwin Hubble (1889–1953) did much of this observational
work in the 1920s using the 2.5-m (100-inch) telescope† on Mt. Wilson near 
Los Angeles, California, then the world’s largest. Hubble demonstrated that these
objects were indeed extragalactic because of their great distances. The distance
to our nearest large galaxy,‡ Andromeda, is over 2 million light-years, a distance
20 times greater than the diameter of our Galaxy. It seemed logical that these
nebulae must be galaxies similar to ours. (Note that it is usual to capitalize the
word “galaxy”only when it refers to our own.) Today it is thought there are roughly
galaxies in the observable universe—that is, roughly as many galaxies as there
