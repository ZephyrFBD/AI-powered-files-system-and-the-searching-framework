 cells and increased resistance to the
pathogen, and because some memory cells die, certain vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic
repeat exposures: for instance, tetanus boosters are necessary every ten years because the memory cells only live that long.
Mucosal Immune Memory
A subset of T and B cells of the mucosal immune system differentiates into memory cells just as in the systemic immune
system. Upon reinvasion of the same pathogen type, a pronounced immune response occurs at the mucosal site where the
original pathogen deposited, but a collective defense is also organized within interconnected or adjacent mucosal tissue. For
instance, the immune memory of an infection in the oral cavity would also elicit a response in the pharynx if the oral cavity
was exposed to the same pathogen.

Vaccination (or immunization) involves the delivery, usually by injection as shown in Figure 33.18, of
noninfectious antige
