expression from the gene POLR2A (RNA polymerase II subunit A, which is
expressed in all human tissues). The results are shown in the table. “0” indicates that mRNA or protein were
not detected in that tissue, and “+,” “++,” and “+++” indicate relatively low, medium, or high levels of mRNA
or protein detected, respectively.
(a) Identify which gene was used as a control in this experiment.
(b) Explain why the gene you selected in part (a) would be an appropriate control for this experiment.
(c) Based on the data in the table, determine which of the genes (PDHA1, MBP, or INS) is most likely
involved in glycolysis.
(d) INS is the insulin gene. Insulin is a hormone that is released when blood sugar levels are high. Predict the
levels of INS mRNA and protein that would be found in cells in the pancreas when blood sugar levels are
low. Justify your prediction.
