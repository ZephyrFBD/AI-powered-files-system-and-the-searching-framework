■ Timing and Length of Lab 
Most of the initial student work on these projects can be completed over a two-week 
period. Only two or three days during that time will require about an hour of classwork. 
On other days, a small amount of time will be required for maintenance and data 
collection. Neither you nor your students will have to go to campus on weekends to 
collect data. However, because of the comprehensive nature of the investigation, you 
need to allow sufficient time to familiarize yourself with the materials and procedures 
beforehand to make this exploration a meaningful inquiry-based experience for 
students.
