pearance of keystone species from an ecosystem would
drastically aﬀect the balance of the ecosystem and may lead to the
disappearance of other species. For example, sea otters, a keystone
species, feed on sea urchins, which feed on kelp. The regulation of sea
urchin populations, in turn, maintains suﬀicient kelp for food and
habitats of other species like fish, which use kelp to hide from predators.
The removal of sea otters would drastically aﬀect the marine ecosystem
since, without a predator, sea urchins would consume all the kelp.
Other predators, like jaguars, which have a diet of many diﬀerent species,
keep species in balance by controlling distribution and population of
prey species. Without predators, prey would increase and lead to
competition with each other for resources and possibly the decline of a
species. Beavers alter the environment by building dams and creating
wetlands upon which the prevalence and activities of many species
depend. Bees and hummingbirds are also key
