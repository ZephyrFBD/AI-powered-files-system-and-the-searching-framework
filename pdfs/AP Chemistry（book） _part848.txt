l2 + 4 O21g2 ¡  3 CO21g2 + 3 H2O1l2 
 
 
∆H° = -1790 kJ
 
 Using this information together with the standard en-
thalpies of formation of O21g2, CO21g2, and H2O1l2 from 
 
Appendix C, calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of 
acetone.
 5.76 Calcium carbide 1CaC22 reacts with water to form acetylene 
1C2H22 and Ca1OH22. From the following enthalpy of reac-
tion data and data in Appendix C, calculate ∆Hf° for CaC21s2:
 
 CaC21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡  Ca1OH221s2 + C2H21g2 
 
 
∆H° = -127.2 kJ
 5.77 Gasoline is composed primarily of hydrocarbons, includ-
ing many with eight carbon atoms, called octanes. One of 
the cleanest–burning octanes is a compound called 2,3,4- 
trimethylpentane, which has the following structural formula:
 5.85 (a) Use enthalpies of formation given in Appendix C to cal-
culate ∆H for the reaction Br21g2 ¡ 2 Br1g2, and use this 
value to estimate the bond enthalpy D(Br ¬ Br). (b) How 
large is the difference between the value calculated in part (a) 
and the value give
