1. Adenine—a double-ring base (purine)
2. Thymine—a single-ring base (pyrimidine)
3. Cytosine—a single-ring base (pyrimidine)
4. Guanine—a double-ring base (purine)
Pyrimidines are single-ring nitrogen bases, and purines are double-ring bases. You can remember which of these
bases are purines by the words “pure silver,” where pure suggests purine and Ag (a denine and g uanine) is the
chemical symbol for silver. The first letter of each of these four bases is often used to symbolize the respective
nucleotide (A for the adenine nucleotide, for example).

DNA nucleotides form a single-stranded DNA molecule when the phosphate group of one nucleotide joins to the
sugar of the adjacent nucleotide (Figure 2-12). Two of these single strands of DNA, paired by weak hydrogen bonds
between the bases, form a double-stranded DNA. When bonded in this way, DNA forms a two-stranded spiral, or
double helix. Note that adenine always bonds with thymine and guanine always bonds with cytosine (a
