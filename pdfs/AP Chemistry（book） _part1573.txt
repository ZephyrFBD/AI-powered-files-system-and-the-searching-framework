ume to in-
crease. Thus, the distance between molecules will increase.
(b) The reduction in volume causes the pressure to increase (Boyle’s 
law). Compressing the gas into a smaller volume does not change 
the total number of gas molecules; thus, the total number of 
moles remains the same. The average distance between mole-
cules, however, must decrease because of the smaller volume.
(c)  
Injecting more gas into the cylinder means that more molecules 
are present and there will be an increase in the number of moles 
of gas in the cylinder. Because we have added more molecules 
while keeping the volume constant, the average distance be-
tween molecules must decrease. Avogadro’s law tells us that the 
volume of the cylinder should have increased when we added 
more gas, provided the pressure and temperature were held con-
stant. Here the volume is held constant, as is the temperature, 
which means the pressure must change. Knowing from Boyle’s 
law that there is an inverse relationship
