mosomes to separate correctly, can lead to an incorrect number of
chromosomes (too many or too few) in daughter cells.
Know what each phase of the cell cycle looks like under a microscope. Chapter 7 contains diagrams of each
phase.
In one section of this lab, the sexual life cycle of the fungus Sordaria fimicola is examined. Sexual reproduction in
this fungus involves the fusion of two nuclei—a (+) strain and a (–) strain—to form a diploid zygote. This zygote
immediately undergoes meiosis to produce asci, which contain eight haploid spores each.
During meiosis, crossing-over can occur to increase genetic variation. If crossing-over, or recombination, has
occurred, different genetic combinations will be observed in the offspring when compared with the parent
strain.
These offspring with new genetic combinations are called recombinants. By examining the numbers of
recombinants with the total number of offspring, an estimate of the linkage map distance between two genes can
be calculated
