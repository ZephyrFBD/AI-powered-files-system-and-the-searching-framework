an open field begins to be shaded
by the growth of trees around its perimeter. Predict
changes in this pond after the trees grow large enough to
completely shade the pond.
a.
The population sizes of all organisms will
decrease in response to lower energy flowing
into the pond.
b.
The population densities of all organisms will
increase in response to lower temperatures in the
pond.
c.
The population distributions of large organisms
will shift from clumped to random in response to
lower energy flowing into the pond.
d.
The population distributions of small organisms
will shift from uniform to clumped in response
to lower temperatures in the pond.
85. A researcher has been studying a wildflower
population growing in a large meadow. The researcher
counted individual plants and mapped their locations.
Analysis of the data revealed that the wildflower has a
uniform population distribution. This result prompts the
researcher to ask a new scientific question to further refine
his understanding
