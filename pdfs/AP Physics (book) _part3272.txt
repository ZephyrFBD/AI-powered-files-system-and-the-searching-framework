29–8 Semiconductors and Doping
Nearly all electronic devices today use semiconductors—mainly silicon (Si),
although the first transistor (1948) was made with germanium (Ge). An atom of
silicon has four outer electrons (group IV of the Periodic Table) that act to hold
the atoms in the regular lattice structure of the crystal, shown schematically in
Fig. 29–26a. Silicon acquires properties useful for electronics when a tiny amount
of impurity is introduced into the crystal structure (perhaps 1 part in 
or 
).
This is called doping the semiconductor. Two kinds of doped semiconductor can
be made, depending on the type of impurity used. The impurity can be an element
whose atoms have five outer electrons (group V in the Periodic Table), such as arsenic.
