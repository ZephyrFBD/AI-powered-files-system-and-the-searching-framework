with the
marine extinction record.
The Cretaceous and Jurassic were periods of warm
landmasses covered by a shallow sea. The ends of these
periods are known to be due to asteroids that left a
sedimentary trace. At the end of the Triassic, there is no
evidence of an asteroid impact. Instead, there was massive
volcanism associated with the opening of the Atlantic
Ocean, a four-fold increase in carbon dioxide, and a 3–6
°C temperature rise (A. Marzoli et al., Science, 1999).
Macrofossil, spore, and pollen data show that marine
animal species declined much more than marine plant
species (L. Mander et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 2010). The
cause of the end of the Permian period is less uncertain,
but an 8-°C temperature rise has been established
(McElwain and Punyasena, Trends in Ecology and
Evolution, 2007). Both terrestrial and marine taxa were
affected.
The graph estimates the number of distinct families,
including both marine and terrestrial, as a function of time
before the present. Note
