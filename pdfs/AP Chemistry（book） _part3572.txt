-, and H3AsO32. These species are collec-
tively referred to by the oxidation number of the arsenic as arsenic(V) 
and arsenic(III), respectively. Arsenic(V) is more prevalent in oxygen- 
rich (aerobic) surface waters, whereas arsenic(III) is more likely to 
occur in oxygen-poor (anaerobic) groundwaters.
One of the challenges in determining the health effects of 
arsenic in drinking waters is the different chemistry of arsenic(V) 
and arsenic(III), as well as the different concentrations required for 
physiological responses in different individuals. In Bangladesh, 
skin lesions were the first sign of the arsenic problem. Statistical 
studies correlating arsenic levels with the occurrence of disease 
indicate a lung and bladder cancer risk arising from even low levels 
of arsenic.
The current technologies for removing arsenic perform most 
effectively when treating arsenic in the form of arsenic(V), so water 
treatment strategies require preoxidation of the drinking water. Once
