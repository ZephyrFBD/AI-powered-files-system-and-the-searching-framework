in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition
substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such
as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a
pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the
result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece
of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome;
this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure 14.22.
