t growth, directional growth toward light,
and many other growth responses. Cytokinins stimulate cell division and counter apical dominance in shoots. Gibberellins
inhibit dormancy of seeds and promote stem growth. Abscisic acid induces dormancy in seeds and buds, and protects
plants from excessive water loss by promoting stomatal closure. Ethylene gas speeds up fruit ripening and dropping of
leaves. Plants respond to touch by rapid movements (thigmotropy and thigmonasty) and slow differential growth
(thigmomorphogenesis). Plants have evolved defense mechanisms against predators and pathogens. Physical barriers like
bark and spines protect tender tissues. Plants also have chemical defenses, including toxic secondary metabolites and
hormones, which elicit additional defense mechanisms.
