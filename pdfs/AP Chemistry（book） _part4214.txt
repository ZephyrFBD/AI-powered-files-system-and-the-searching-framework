Yes, because water does not decompose on sitting the way that 
hydrogen peroxide does. Figure 7.27 A regular octagon.  
Figure 7.28 I2 is a solid whereas Cl2 is a gas. Molecules are more 
closely packed together in a solid than they are in a gas, as will be dis-
cussed in detail in Chapter 11.

Figure 8.1 We would draw the chemical structure of sugar mol-
ecules (which have no charges and have covalent bonding between 
atoms in each molecule) and indicate weak intermolecular forces 
(especially hydrogen bonding) between sugar molecules.  
Figure 8.3 Yes. Figure 8.4 Cations have a smaller radius than 
their neutral atoms and anions have a larger radius. Because Na and 
Cl are in the same row of the periodic table, we would expect Na+ 
to have a smaller radius than Cl-, so we would infer that the larger 
green spheres represent the chloride ions and the smaller purple 
spheres represent the sodium ions. Figure 8.5 The distance 
between ions in KF should be large
