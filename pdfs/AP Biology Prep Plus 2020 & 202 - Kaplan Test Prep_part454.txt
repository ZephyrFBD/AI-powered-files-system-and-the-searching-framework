as of the cell. In fact, plant cells have centrosomes
without centrioles. The thing to remember is that the centrosome regions
form the two poles (like north and south) on opposite ends of the cells,
between which microtubule spindle fibers will form.
Despite the conventional division into distinct stages, mitosis is a
continuous process that does not stop between each phase. Four of these
stages comprise mitosis, and the final stage—cytokinesis—completes the
process of cell division as the cell pinches in two.
Prophase
In prophase, chromatin shows up under the microscope as well-defined
chromosomes. These chromosomes are an X shape, two sister
chromatids connected by a centromere, a specific DNA sequence. The
mitotic spindle begins to form and elongate from the centrosome regions
during prophase.
Metaphase
During metaphase, kinetochore microtubules push equally from opposite
poles so that chromosomes are aligned in the middle of the cell. This
center area where the alignment occurs is
