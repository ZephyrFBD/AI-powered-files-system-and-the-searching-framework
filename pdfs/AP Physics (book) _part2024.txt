. (II) Can a 2.2-mm-diameter copper wire have the same
resistance as a tungsten wire of the same length? Give numer-
ical details.
16. (II) A certain copper wire has a resistance of 
At
what point along its length must the wire be cut so that the
resistance of one piece is 4.0 times the resistance of the
other? What is the resistance of each piece?
17. (II) Compute the voltage drop along a 21-m length of
household no. 14 copper wire (used in 15-A circuits). The
wire has diameter 1.628 mm and carries a 12-A current.
18. (II) Two aluminum wires have the same resistance. If one has
twice the length of the other, what is the ratio of the diameter
of the longer wire to the diameter of the shorter wire?
