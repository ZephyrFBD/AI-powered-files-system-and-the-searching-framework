 its arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, smooth muscle does not have the
striated appearance of skeletal muscle. In addition, the sarcolemma does not form a system of transverse tubules,
and as a result, contraction is controlled and relatively slowâ€”properties appropriate for its function.
3. Cardiac muscle is responsible for the rhythmic contractions of the heart. Although striated, cardiac muscle
differs from skeletal muscle in that it is highly branched, with cells connected by gap junctions. In addition, cardiac
muscle generates its own action potential, which spreads rapidly throughout muscle tissue by electrical synapses
across the gap junctions.
