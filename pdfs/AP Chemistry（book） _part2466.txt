than 1 if the volume is 1 L and each atom/
molecule in the diagram represents 1 mol? [Section 15.2]
 
15.4 The following diagram represents a reaction shown going 
to completion. Each molecule in the diagram represents 
0.1 mol, and the volume of the box is 1.0 L. (a) Letting 
A = red spheres and B = blue spheres, write a balanced 
equation for the reaction. (b) Write the equilibrium- 
constant expression for the reaction. (c) Calculate the 
value of Kc. (d) Assuming that all of the molecules are in 
the gas phase, calculate ∆n, the change in the number of 
gas molecules that accompanies the reaction. (e) Calcu-
late the value of Kp. [Section 15.2]
