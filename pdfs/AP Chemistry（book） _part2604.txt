effects of chemical structure on acid–base behavior.
Factors That Affect Acid Strength
The strength of an acid is often affected by three separate factors.
t H—A Bond Polarity A molecule containing H will act as a proton donor (an acid) 
only if the H—A bond is polarized such that the H atom has a partial positive charge. 
 (Section 8.4) Recall that we indicate such polarization in this way:
A
H
In ionic hydrides, such as NaH, the bond is polarized in the opposite way: The H 
atom possesses a negative charge and behaves as a proton acceptor (a base). Nonpolar 
H—A bonds, such as the H—C bond in CH4, produce neither acidic nor basic aqueous 
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Indicate which salt in each of the following pairs forms the 
more acidic (or less basic) 0.010 M solution:  
(a) NaNO3 or Fe1NO323, (b) KBr or KBrO,  
(c) CH3NH3Cl or BaCl2, (d) NH4NO2 or NH4NO3.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Order the following solutions from lowest to highest pH:  
(i) 0.10 M NaClO, (ii) 0.10 M KBr, (iii) 0.1
