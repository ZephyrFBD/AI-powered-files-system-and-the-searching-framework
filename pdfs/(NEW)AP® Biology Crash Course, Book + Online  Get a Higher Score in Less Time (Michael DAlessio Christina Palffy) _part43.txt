You will not be required to know the names of enzymes or specific steps and intermediates of pathways. However, be prepared to apply
the concepts in this chapter, with particular stress on how organisms utilize free energy.

Photosynthesis
I.
Key Concepts
A. Photosynthesis occurs in all photosynthetic autotrophs, including plants, algae, and photosynthetic
prokaryotes.
B. In eukaryotes, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts; in prokaryotes, it occurs in the plasma membrane
and in the cytoplasm.
C. The overall equation for photosynthesis is:
D. Photosynthesis is affected by a variety of environmental factors.
E. In eukaryotes, each phase of photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts.
II.
The Two Steps of Photosynthesis
A. Photosynthesis has two main steps:
1. Light-dependent reactions—the absorption of light energy and its conversion to the chemical energy
of ATP and the reducing power of NADPH.
2. Light-independent reactions—the us
