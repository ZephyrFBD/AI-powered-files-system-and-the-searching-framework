 other. The balls are dropped from a second-story balcony at the exact same
time. The time to reach the ground below will be:
(a) twice as long for the lighter ball as for the heavier one.
(b) longer for the lighter ball, but not twice as long.
(c) twice as long for the heavier ball as for the lighter one.
(d) longer for the heavier ball, but not twice as long.
(e) nearly the same for both balls.
T
he motion of objects—baseballs, automobiles, joggers, and even the Sun
and Moon—is an obvious part of everyday life. It was not until the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that our modern understanding of
motion was established. Many individuals contributed to this understanding,
particularly Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) and Isaac Newton (1642–1727).
The study of the motion of objects, and the related concepts of force and energy,
form the field called mechanics. Mechanics is customarily divided into two parts:
kinematics, which is the description of how objects move, and dynamics, which
