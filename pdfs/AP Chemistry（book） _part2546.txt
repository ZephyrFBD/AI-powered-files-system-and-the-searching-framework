▲ Figure 16.8 pH ranges for common acid–base indicators. Most indicators have a useful range 
of about 2 pH units.

Which of these indicators is best 
suited to distinguish between a 
solution that is slightly acidic and 
one that is slightly basic?
Methyl red
Bromthymol blue
Phenolphthalein

common acid–base indicators at various pH 
values.
*If the concentration of the acid is 10 - 6 M or less, we also need to consider H+ ions that result 
from H2O autoionization. Normally, the concentration of H+ from H2O is so small that it can be 
neglected.

Strong Bases
The most common soluble strong bases are the ionic hydroxides of the alkali metals, 
such as NaOH, KOH, and the ionic hydroxides of heavier alkaline earth metals, such as 
Sr1OH22. These compounds completely dissociate into ions in aqueous solution. Thus, a 
solution labeled 0.30 M NaOH c
