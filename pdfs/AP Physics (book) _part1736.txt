reas negatively charged
objects have an excess of electrons. The charge on one electron has been deter-
mined to have a magnitude of about 
and is negative. This is the
smallest charge observed in nature,‡ and because it is fundamental, it is given the
symbol e and is often referred to as the elementary charge:
Note that e is defined as a positive number, so the charge on the electron is
(The charge on a proton, on the other hand, is 
) Since an object cannot gain or
lose a fraction of an electron, the net charge on any object must be an integral
multiple of this charge. Electric charge is thus said to be quantized (existing only
in discrete amounts: 1e, 2e, 3e, etc.). Because e is so small, however, we normally
do not notice this discreteness in macroscopic charges (
requires about 
electrons), which thus seem continuous.
Coulomb’s law looks a lot like the law of universal gravitation,
which expresses the magnitude of the gravitational force a mass 
exerts on a
mass 
(Eq. 5–4). Both a
