ections. Under anaerobic
conditions (in the absence of oxygen), pyruvate is reduced during the
process of fermentation. Under aerobic conditions (in the presence of
oxygen), pyruvate is further oxidized during cellular respiration in the
mitochondria.
FERMENTATION
The production of ATP involves the oxidation of carbohydrates, a process
that requires NAD+ as an oxidizing agent. In the absence of O2 (also an
oxidizing agent), NAD+ must be regenerated for glycolysis to continue.
This is accomplished by reducing pyruvate into ethanol or lactic acid.
Fermentation refers to all of the reactions involved in this processâ€”
glycolysis and the additional steps leading to the formation of ethanol or
lactic acid. Fermentation produces only 2 ATP per glucose molecule.
Alcohol fermentation commonly occurs only in yeast and some bacteria.
The pyruvate produced in glycolysis is decarboxylated to become
acetaldehyde, which is then reduced by the NADH to yield ethanol. In this
way, NAD+ is regenerated an
