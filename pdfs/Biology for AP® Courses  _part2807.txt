a definite right or left side. This
plan is found mostly in aquatic animals, especially organisms that attach themselves to a base, like a rock or a boat, and
extract their food from the surrounding water as it flows around the organism. Bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same

figure by a goat. The goat also has an upper and lower component to it, but a plane cut from front to back separates the
animal into definite right and left sides. Additional terms used when describing positions in the body are anterior (front),
posterior (rear), dorsal (toward the back), and ventral (toward the stomach). Bilateral symmetry is found in both land-based
and aquatic animals; it enables a high level of mobility.
Limits on Animal Size and Shape
Animals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape: this is a tubular shaped body that is
tapered at both ends. This shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves
