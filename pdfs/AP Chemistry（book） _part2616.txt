cause the 
COOH group can act as an acid and the NH2 group can act as a base, 
amino acids undergo a “self-contained” Brønsted–Lowry acid–base 
reaction in which the proton of the carboxyl group is transferred to 
the basic nitrogen atom:
ChEmiStRy And LifE The Amphiprotic Behavior of Amino Acids
As we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 24, amino acids are the 
building blocks of proteins. The general structure of amino acids is

where different amino acids have different R groups attached to the 
central carbon atom. For example, in glycine, the simplest amino acid, 
R is a hydrogen atom, and in alanine R is a CH3 group:

For a substance to be a proton acceptor (a Brønsted–Lowry base), it must have an 
unshared pair of electrons fo
