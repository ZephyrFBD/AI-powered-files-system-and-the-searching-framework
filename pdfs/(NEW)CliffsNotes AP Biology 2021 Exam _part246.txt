and when a cell divides is determined much like other metabolic activities, by enzymes. Enzymes are produced
at specific points of the cell cycle that induce specific activities that prepare the cell for division. The production of
these enzymes is affected by environmental factors (such as carcinogens or cell density), by internal conditions, and
by genetic factors. In a transformed cell, a cell that has become cancerous, the normal cell-cycle checkpoints and
other regulatory mechanisms fail. For example, most cancerous cells lack anchorage dependence, growing and
dividing without the need to attach to nearby cells.
The AP exam does not require you to use the names of the phases of the cell cycle (prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
telophase) in your responses. You would receive an equal amount of credit for your response if you omitted these
words and only described the events of mitosis and meiosis in the correct sequence of occurrence.
