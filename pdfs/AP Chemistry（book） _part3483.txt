 A 788-mg sample of the CaCO3 had a radioactivity 
of 1.5 * 10-2 Bq due to carbon-14. By comparison, living 
organisms undergo 15.3 disintegrations per minute per 
gram of carbon. Using the half-life of carbon-14, 5700 yr, 
calculate the age of the charcoal sample.
 21.92  A 25.0-mL sample of 0.050 M barium nitrate solution was 
mixed with 25.0 mL of 0.050 M sodium sulfate solution 
labeled with radioactive sulfur-35. The activity of the initial 
sodium sulfate solution was 1.22 * 106 Bq>mL. After the 
resultant precipitate was removed by filtration, the remain-
ing filtrate was found to have an activity of 250 Bq/mL. 
(a) Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction 
that occurred. (b) Calculate the Ksp for the precipitate 
under the conditions of the experiment.
Design an Experiment
Because radioactivity can have harmful effects on human health, 
very stringent experimental procedures and precautions are re-
quired when undertaking experiments on radioactive materials. As
