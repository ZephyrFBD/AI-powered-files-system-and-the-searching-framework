to
need energy to accomplish this. This time itâ€™s like riding a bicycle uphill. Compared with riding downhill, riding
uphill takes a lot more work. Movement against the natural flow is called active transport.
Resting Membrane Potential
The sodium-potassium pump is important for setting up the typical charge
within the cell, and the inside is always a little bit negative. This resting
membrane potential (difference in charge between inside and outside the cell)
is important for passing signals in the body.
But where does the protein get this energy? Some proteins in the plasma membrane are powered by ATP. The best
example of active transport is a special protein called the sodium-potassium pump. It ushers out three sodium ions
(Na+) and brings in two potassium ions (K+) across the cell membrane. This pump depends on ATP to get ions
across that would otherwise remain in regions of higher concentration. Primary active transport occurs when ATP is
directly utilized to transport something.
