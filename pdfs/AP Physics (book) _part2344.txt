EXAMPLE 21;11
The great advantage of ac, and a major reason it is in nearly universal use†, is
that the voltage can easily be stepped up or down by a transformer. The output
voltage of an electric generating plant is stepped up prior to transmission. Upon
arrival in a city, it is stepped down in stages at electric substations prior to distri-
bution. The voltage in lines along city streets is typically 2400 V or 7200 V and is
stepped down to 240 V or 120 V for home use by transformers (Figs.21–22 and 21–25).
†DC transmission along wires does exist, and has some advantages (if the current is constant, there is
no induced current in nearby conductors as there is with ac). But boosting to high voltage and down
again at the receiving end requires more complicated electronics.
