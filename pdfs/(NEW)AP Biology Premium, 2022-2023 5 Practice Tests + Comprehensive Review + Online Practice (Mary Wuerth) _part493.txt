e approximate time of evolutionary events.
These phylogenetic trees and cladograms are created using morphological evidence from fossils and time estimates
from molecular clocks (changes in DNA and protein sequences over time). Generally, evidence from molecular
clocks is considered more accurate than morphological characteristics because molecular data are less influenced by
convergent evolution or external geological events.
Morphological evidence from fossils shows traits that are gained, or lost, over time that can be used to construct
phylogenetic trees. Shared characteristics are traits that are present in more than one lineage. Shared derived
characteristics are found in a group of related organisms called a clade and set the clade apart from other
organisms. Shared derived characteristics indicate homology among organisms in a clade and are evidence of their
common ancestry.
Nodes on phylogenetic trees represent common ancestors. The more recent the common ancestor of two speci
