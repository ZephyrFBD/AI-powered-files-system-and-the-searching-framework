e could have a curvature so
slight that we don’t normally notice it. This is a crucial question in cosmology,
and it can be answered only by precise experimentation.
If the universe had a positive curvature, the universe would be closed, or
finite in volume. This would not mean that the stars and galaxies extended out to
a certain boundary, beyond which there is empty space. There is no boundary or
edge in such a universe. The universe is all there is. If a particle were to move in
a straight line in a particular direction, it would eventually return to the starting
point—perhaps eons of time later.
On the other hand, if the curvature of space was zero or negative, the
universe would be open. It could just go on forever. An open universe could be
infinite; but according to recent research, even that may not necessarily be so.
Today the evidence is very strong that the universe on a large scale is very
close to being flat. Indeed, it is so close to being flat that we can’t tell if it mi
