 Exponential Notation 
1081
Perform each of the following operations, using your calculator where possible:
(a) Write the number 0.0054 in standard exponential notation. (b) 15.0 * 10-22 + 14.7 * 10-32 (c) 15.98 * 10122
12.77 * 10-52 (d)
4
21.75 * 10-12
Sample Exercise 1 
Using Exponential Notation
SOLUTION
(a) Because we move the decimal point three places to the right to 
convert 0.0054 to 5.4, the exponent is -3:
5.4 * 10-3
 
Scientific calculators are generally able to convert numbers to 
exponential notation using one or two keystrokes; frequently 
“SCI” for “scientific notation” will convert a number into  
exponential notation. Consult your instruction manual to see 
how this operation is accomplished on your calculator.

Common Logarithms
The common, or base-10, logarithm (abbreviated log) of any number is the power to 
which 10 must be raised to equal the number. For example, the common logarithm
