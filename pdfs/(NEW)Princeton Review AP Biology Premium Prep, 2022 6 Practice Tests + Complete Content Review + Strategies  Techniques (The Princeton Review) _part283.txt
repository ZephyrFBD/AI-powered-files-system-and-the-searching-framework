 Proto-oncogenes are genes that help the cell divide.
If either type is mutated (a mutated proto-oncogene is called an oncogene), it can lead to cell growth that is out
of control.
Mitosis, or cellular division, occurs in four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
During prophase, the nuclear envelope disappears and chromosomes condense.
Next is metaphase, when chromosomes align at the metaphase plate and mitotic spindles attach to
kinetochores.
In anaphase, chromosomes are pulled away from the center.
Telophase terminates mitosis, and the two new nuclei form.
The process of cytokinesis, which occurs during telophase, ends mitosis, as the cytoplasm and plasma
membranes pinch to form two distinct, identical daughter cells.
