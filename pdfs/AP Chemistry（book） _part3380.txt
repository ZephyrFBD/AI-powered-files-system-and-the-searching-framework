adioactive decay, the rock would also 
contain large amounts of the more abundant isotope lead-208. In the absence of large 
amounts of this “geonormal” isotope of lead, it is assumed that all of the lead-206 was at 
one time uranium-238.
The oldest rocks found on Earth are approximately 3 * 109 yr old. This age indicates 
that Earth’s crust has been solid for at least this length of time. Scientists estimate that it 
required 1 * 109 to 1.5 * 109 yr for Earth to cool and its surface to become solid, making 
the age of Earth 4.0 to 4.5 * 109 yr.

1 Cosmic rays (largely protons) 
enter the atmosphere and collide 
with atoms, creating neutrons.
Nitrogen atoms capture a neutron 
and emit a proton, forming 14C.
14C atoms are incorporated in 
CO2, which is taken up by plants 
and made into more complex 
molecules through photosynthesis.
Animals and people take in 14C 
by eating plants.
