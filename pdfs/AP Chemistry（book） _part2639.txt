most accurate because as the acid concen-
tration increases, a greater proportion of it is ionized.
(d) Line B is the most accurate because as the acid concen-
tration increases, Ka increases.
(e) Line C is the most accurate because as the acid concen-
tration increases, a lesser proportion of it ionized.
(f) Line C is the most accurate because as the acid concen-
tration increases, Ka decreases.
