ne way to define a temperature scale is to assign arbitrary values to two
readily reproducible temperatures. For both the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales
these two fixed points are chosen to be the freezing point and the boiling point†
of water, both taken at standard atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, the
freezing point of water is chosen to be 0°C (“zero degrees Celsius”) and the boiling
point 100°C. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point is defined as 32°F and
the boiling point 212°F. A practical thermometer is calibrated by placing it in
carefully prepared environments at each of the two temperatures and marking
the position of the liquid or pointer. For a Celsius scale, the distance between the
two marks is divided into one hundred equal intervals representing each degree
between 0°C and 100°C (hence the name “centigrade scale” meaning “hundred
steps”). For the Fahrenheit scale, the two points are labeled 32°F and 212°F and
the distance between them is divided into 180
