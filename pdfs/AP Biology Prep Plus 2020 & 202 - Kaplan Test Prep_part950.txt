characteristic that would diﬀerentiate
the two phyla from others. Of the nine major animal phyla, only
Echinodermata and Chordata are deuterostomes, in which the anus
forms prior to the mouth in the gut cavity. (B) is thus correct. (A) is not
true but, even if it were, a relative abundance of species would not
support a close relationship. (C) and (D) are characteristics common
among all Animalia and would not explain why Echinodermata are
thought to be more closely related to Chordata than to other animals.
32. C
Most drugs exert therapeutic eﬀects by interfering with the normal
functioning of a biological system, and the toxicity of a drug oȇen
depends on the extent of interference and not whether such
interference is present or absent. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because many artificial substances are inherently inert and non-toxic
(e.g., polyethylene), and many drugs with toxic side-eﬀects can be
obtained from natural sources (e.g., aspirin). (A) also fails to explain
why
