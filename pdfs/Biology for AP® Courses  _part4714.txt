, impact ecosystems and the species
inhabiting them. By appreciating and protecting other species, we preserve our own. The inverse is also true.
The exact number and kinds of species on Earth is unknown, but scientists estimate that there are about 8.7 million
eukaryotic species, with only 1.5 million identified, named, and studied. The number of prokaryotes far exceeds these
numbers. Biodiversity describes the number and variety of organisms in the biosphere.
We have learned that evolution and speciation continue to occur, but Earth has experienced five mass extinctions—the
elimination of major groups of species. For AP® you do not need to know the names, dates and causes of these extinctions;
however understanding them will help you understand how biodiversity has changed over time.
