e. This
is analogous to making a negative from a photograph and using the
negative for all subsequent copies rather than using the photograph
itself. Replication proceeds using host cell DNA and RNA polymerases as
cells normally would.
Assembly and release: Viral nucleic acid is packaged within a protein
capsid, and “baby” virus particles are released from the cell either en
masse or slowly. En masse release ruptures and kills the host cell; slowly
means the particles bud out of the host cell surface and envelop
themselves in the host cell membrane as they push their way out.
Budding in a slow and deliberate fashion will usually allow the host cell to
live.
LYSOGENIC CYCLE
The cycle described in the previous section is typical of most viruses: it is
called a lytic cycle because the host cells usually lyse, or burst, in the end.
Some viruses, however, use a lysogenic cycle, whereby the viral DNA gets
integrated into the host cell’s DNA and can remain there indefinitely,
allowing viral D
