l to the net force
applied to it.
We can write this as an equation,
(7;2)
where 
is the net force applied to the object (the vector sum of all forces acting
on it) and 
is the resulting momentum change that occurs during the time
interval†
We can readily derive the familiar form of the second law,
from
Eq. 7–2 for the case of constant mass. If 
is the initial velocity of an object and
is its velocity after a time interval 
has elapsed, then
By definition,
so
[constant mass]
Equation 7–2 is a more general statement of Newton’s second law than the more
familiar version  
because it includes the situation in which the mass
may change. A change in mass occurs in certain circumstances, such as for rockets
which lose mass as they expel burnt fuel.
