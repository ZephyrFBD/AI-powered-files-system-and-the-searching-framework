pyruvate, and each can attach to a molecule of CoA and then enter the citric acid cycle. (A simple
rule is to “count the carbons.” Because matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, we must account for everything.)
The electrons are picked up by NAD+, and NADH carries the electrons to a later pathway (the electron transport chain
described below) for ATP production. The glucose molecule that originally entered cellular respiration in glycolysis has
been completely oxidized. Chemical potential energy stored within the glucose molecules has been transferred to NADH or
has been used to synthesize ATP molecules.
The citric acid cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and involves a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that
again remove high energy electrons and produce CO2. These electrons are carried by NADH and FADH2 to the electron
transport chain located in the cristae of the mitochondrion. (You do not need to memorize the steps in the citric acid cycle,
but if provide
