APPROACH We want to find the potential energy of the two charges in one
dipole due to the two charges in the other, because this will be equal to the
work needed to pull the two dipoles infinitely far apart. The potential energy 
of a charge 
in the presence of a charge 
is 
where
and 
is the distance between the two charges. (See
Eqs. 17–2 and 17–5.)
SOLUTION The potential energy consists of four terms:
where 
means the potential energy of C in the presence of H, and similarly
for the other terms. We do not have terms corresponding to C and O, or N and H,
because the two dipoles are assumed to be stable entities. Then, using the 
distances shown in Fig. 29–11, we get:

pe = peCH + peCN + peOH + peON
