Back EMF, in a Motor
A motor turns and produces mechanical energy when a current is made to flow in
it. From our description in Section 20–10 of a simple dc motor, you might expect
that the armature would accelerate indefinitely due to the torque on it. However,
as the armature of the motor turns, the magnetic flux through the coil changes
and an emf is generated. This induced emf acts to oppose the motion (Lenz’s law)
and is called the back emf or counter emf. The greater the speed of the motor,
the greater the back emf. A motor normally turns and does work on something,
but if there were no load to push (or rotate), the motor’s spe
