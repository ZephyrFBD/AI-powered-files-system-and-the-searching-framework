Snell’s Law
The angle of refraction depends on the speed of light in the two media and on the
incident angle. An analytic relation between 
and 
in Fig. 23–21 was arrived 
at experimentally about 1621 by Willebrord Snell (1591–1626). Known as Snell’s law,
it is written:
(23;5)
is the angle of incidence and 
is the angle of refraction;
and 
are the respec-
tive indices of refraction in the materials. See Fig. 23–21. The incident and refracted
rays lie in the same plane, which also includes the perpendicular to the surface.
Snell’s law is the law of refraction. (Snell’s law was derived in Section 11–13
for water waves where Eq. 11–20 is just a combination of Eqs. 23–5 and 23–4,
and we derive it again in Chapter 24 using the wave theory of light.)
Snell’s law shows that if
then
Thus, if light enters a medium
where n is greater (and its speed is less), the ray is bent toward the normal. And if
then
so the ray bends away from the normal. See Fig. 23–21.
