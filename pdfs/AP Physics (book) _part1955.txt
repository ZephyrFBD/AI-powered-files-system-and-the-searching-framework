in series and their voltages add up. Thus, the voltage between the ends of two 
1.5-V AA flashlight batteries connected in series is 3.0 V, whereas the six 2-V cells
of an automobile storage battery give 12 V. Figure 18–4a shows a diagram of a
common “dry cell” or “flashlight battery” used not only in flashlights but in many
portable electronic devices, and Fig. 18–4b shows two smaller ones connected in
series to a flashlight bulb. An incandescent lightbulb consists of a thin, coiled
wire (filament) inside an evacuated glass bulb, as shown in Fig. 18–5 and in the
Chapter-Opening Photos, page 501. When charge passes through the filament, it gets
very hot (
) and glows. Other bulb types, such as fluorescent, work differently.
