EXERCISE A At a particular instant in time, a wave has its electric field pointing north
and its magnetic field pointing up. In which direction is the wave traveling? (a) South,
(b) west, (c) east, (d) down, (e) not enough information. [See Fig. 22–7.]
22–3 Light as an Electromagnetic Wave
and the Electromagnetic Spectrum
Maxwell’s prediction that EM waves should exist was startling. Equally remarkable
was the speed at which EM waves were p
