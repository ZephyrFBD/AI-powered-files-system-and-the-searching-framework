mRNA lengths among various tissues points to
diﬀerent splicing patterns being used in diﬀerent tissues. This is also
evident by the similar-sized fragments found in similar tissue, like
among muscle cells of the same type. Thus, the correct answer is (C).
(A) is incorrect because mRNA molecules exhibiting diﬀerent levels of
stability would degrade into lengths that vary from experiment to
experiment. (B) is incorrect because all mRNAs were isolated by
binding to poly(T) and, therefore, must have had poly(A) tails. (D) is
incorrect because the absence of a methyl-guanosine cap would not
make a noticeable change in the size of the molecules.

Amino acids are encoded by codons, which are sequences of three
nucleotides. An mRNA sequence that is 156 nucleotides long has
156 ÷ 3 or 52 codons. The start codon encodes the amino acid
methionine, and the last codon is the stop codon, which is not
translated. Thus, the peptide would contain 51 amino acids. The
correc
