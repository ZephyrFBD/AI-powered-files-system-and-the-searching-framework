ints or construct an accurate best-fit line. The student 
is able to write a coherent paragraph with appropriate 
terminology and elaboration to explain that the shape of 
the curve from 23â€“28 degrees demonstrates that the rate of 
evaporation increases with increasing temperature and/or 
that at higher temperatures there are more open stomata. 
The student also recognizes the leveling off of the line and  
is able to explain that as the temperature rises too high  
the plant begins to close its stomata to prevent excessive  
water loss. 
(Part b) The student is able to draw a curve that possesses 
properly labeled and scaled axes indicating a measure 
of humidity. The student then explains this decreasing 
curve to the fact that increasing humidity leads to reduced 
evaporation rates due to a decreased difference in water 
vapor pressure between the leaf and the atmosphere.
(Part c) The student can use the graph, a representation of 
the effect of increasing percentage of open stomata
