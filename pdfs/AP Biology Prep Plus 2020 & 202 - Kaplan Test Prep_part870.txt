Suppose an egg from the 100% corn syrup solution was then immersed
into pure distilled water. Predict what would happen to the egg, and
justify your response.

To investigate the relatedness of four diﬀerent species, researchers
determined the nucleotide sequences for four homologous genes. The table
below shows a 20-nucleotide section of the gene for each species.

On the template provided, use the information in Table 1 to construct a
table scoring the number of nucleotide diﬀerences in the sequences
between each pair of species.

Using the data in the table you constructed in part (a), create a
phylogenetic tree on the template provided to reflect the evolutionary
relationships of the four species.
