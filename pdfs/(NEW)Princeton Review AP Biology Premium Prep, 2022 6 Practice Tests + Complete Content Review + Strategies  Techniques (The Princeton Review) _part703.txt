eplicated chromosomes. After replication, there would
be 64 segments since each chromosome would have a sister chromatid.

A
The passage says that humans have 46 chromosomes total. Humans are diploid and have two copies of
each of the non-homologous chromosomes. Thus, humans have 23 unique, non-homologous
chromosomes. If the species has 32 chromosomes and they are octoploidy, then they have 8 copies of
each. So, they have only 4 unique chromosomes.
10.
B
The passage says that two gametes come together to make an octoploidy (8n) species. Therefore, each
gamete should be tetraploidy (4n). If they have four non-homologous chromosomes, then 4 Ã— 4 = 16.

The peak in 1958 is in the middle, corresponding to medium-orange fish. However, there are also some
fish on each extreme (light or dark).

These graphs of phenotype tell us nothing about the mode of inheritance.

If a dark-colored, poisonous fish existed, predators would soon learn to avoid dark-colored fish. The dark-
