xyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (Figure 3.33). The difference between the
sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the
deoxyribose. The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”). The
phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3′ carbon
of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 5′–3′ phosphodiester linkage. The phosphodiester linkage is not formed
by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the

removal of two phosphate groups. A polynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages.
DNA Double-Helix Structure
DNA has a double-helix structure (Figure 3.34). The sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the
backbone of the DN
