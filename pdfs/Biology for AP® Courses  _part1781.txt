Think About It
How can cells in a multicellular eukaryotic organism be of different types given that they all share the same genome?
16.5 | Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation
In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
How is gene expression controlled through post-transcriptional modifications of RNA molecules?
Connection for AP® Courses
Post-transcriptional regulation can occur at any stage after transcription. One important post-transcriptional mechanism is
RNA splicing. After RNA is transcribed, it is often modified to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. As
we studied in previous chapters, processing messenger RNA involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein.
Spliceosomes remove the introns and ligate the exons together, often in different sequences than their original order on the
newly transcribed (immature) messenger RNA. A GTP cap is added to the 5’-end and a poly-A tail is added to the 3’-end.
