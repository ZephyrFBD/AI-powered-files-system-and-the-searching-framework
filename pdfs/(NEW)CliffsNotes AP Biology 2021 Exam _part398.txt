gether). The
forelimbs of cats, bats, whales, and humans are homologous because they have all evolved from a common ancestral
mammal. In some species, homologous structures have become vestigial, that is, they no longer serve any function.
The remnants of limbs in snakes, hind limbs in whales, and the wings of flightless birds are examples of vestigial
structures, structures that provide evidence of evolutionary heritage.
Analogous structures (analogies) are body parts that resemble one another in different species, not because they
have evolved from a common ancestor, but because they evolved independently as adaptations to their
environments. The fins and body shapes of sharks, penguins, and porpoises are analogous because they are
adaptations to swimming.
5. Molecular biology examines the nucleotide and amino acid sequences
of DNA and proteins from different species. Closely related species share higher percentages of sequences than
species distantly related. In addition, all living
