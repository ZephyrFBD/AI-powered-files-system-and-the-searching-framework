phototrophs and began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. The increase in oxygen concentration allowed the evolution of
other life forms. Fossilized microbial mats are called stromatolites and consist of laminated organo-sedimentary structures
formed by precipitation of minerals by prokaryotes. They represent the earliest fossil record of life on Earth.
Bacteria and archaea grow in virtually every environment. Those that survive under extreme conditions are called
extremophiles (extreme lovers). Some prokaryotes cannot grow in a laboratory setting, but they are not dead. They are in
the viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes enter a dormant state in response
to environmental stressors. Most prokaryotes are social and prefer to live in communities where interac
