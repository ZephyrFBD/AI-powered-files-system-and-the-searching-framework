eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of
replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication.

In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the
chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.
The number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to
have major roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol α, pol β, pol γ, pol δ, and pol ε.
The essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made
available as template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes.
The chromatin (th
