 Thus, only a 20Â° increase in temperature produces a more 
than tenfold increase in the fraction of molecules possessing at least 100 kJ>mol of energy.
The Arrhenius Equation
Arrhenius noted that for most reactions the increase in rate with increasing temperature 
is nonlinear (Figure 14.13). He found that most reaction-rate data obeyed an equation 
based on (a) the fraction of molecules possessing energy Ea or greater, (b) the number of 
collisions per second, and (c) the fraction of collisions that have the appropriate orienta-
tion. These three factors are incorporated into the Arrhenius equation:
 
k = Ae-Ea>RT 
[14.21]
In this equation, k is the rate constant, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant 
18.314 J>mol@K2, and T is the absolute temperature. The frequency factor, A, is constant, 
or nearly so, as temperature is varied. This factor is related to the frequency of collisions and 
the probability that the collisions are favorably oriented for reaction.* As the mag
