ating, and may grow to be over 50 ft long by adding segments. The parasite moves from species
to species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life cycle. Another common parasite is Plasmodium
falciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the world. Living in human liver and
red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to complete its life cycle. Thus
malaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious diseases.

Characteristics of Communities
Communities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure (the types and numbers of species present)
and dynamics (how communities change over time). Understanding community structure and dynamics enables community
ecologists to manage ecosystems mor
