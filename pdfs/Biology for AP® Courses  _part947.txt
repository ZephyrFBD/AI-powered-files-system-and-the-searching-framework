As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. That energy is used to move
hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones
produced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used to synthesize ATP in a later step. Because
the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is
absorbed by the PSI antenna. That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called P700). P700 is oxidized and sends a
high-energy electron to NADP+ to form NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP,
and PSI
