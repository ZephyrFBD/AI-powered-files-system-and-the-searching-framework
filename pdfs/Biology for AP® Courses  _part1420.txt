the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous
individual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such as AB) and two recessive
paternal alleles for those same genes (such as ab). If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce
gametes that are either AB or ab with a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produce AB, Ab, aB, and ab
gametes with equal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment. Because they correspond
to new allele combinations, the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination
during meiosis. Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. Morgan and his
colleagues, however, found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent
(AaBb Ã— aabb), both parental and nonparental cases occurred
