calcium levels should be high in all cells so that no 
heterocysts develop. 
(D) In environments with abundant fixed nitrogen, loss of the hetR gene should induce heterocyst development.

60. The figure above shows several steps in the process of bacteriophage transduction in bacteria. Which of the  
following explains how genetic variation in a population of bacteria results from this process? 
(A) Bacterial proteins transferred from the donor bacterium by the phage to the recipient bacterium recombine 
with genes on the recipientâ€™s chromosome. 
(B) The recipient bacterium incorporates the transduced genetic material coding for phage proteins into its 
chromosome and synthesizes the corresponding proteins. 
(C) The phage infection of the recipient bacterium and the introduction of DNA carried by the phage cause 
increased random point mutations of the bacterial chromosome. 
(D) DNA of the recipient bacterial chromosome undergoes recom
