L of N2 gas is passed through 7.2146 g of liquid benzene 
1C6H62 at 26.0 °C. The liquid remaining after the experi-
ment weighs 5.1493 g. Assuming that the gas becomes satu-
rated with benzene vapor and that the total gas volume and 
temperature remain constant, what is the vapor pressure of 
the benzene in torr?

pressure of water at the same temperature times 100%. If 
the relative humidity of the air is 58% and its temperature 
is 68 °F, how many molecules of water are present in a room 
measuring 12 ft * 10 ft * 8 ft?

Intermolecular forces are very important for predicting the phys-
ical properties of molecular substances. Sometimes, however, it is 
difficult to explain or predict trends in these properties because
