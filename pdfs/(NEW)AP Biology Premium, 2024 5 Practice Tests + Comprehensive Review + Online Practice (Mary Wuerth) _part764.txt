Measuring population growth is important in understanding ecosystems. The following equations can be used to
describe population growth.
General rate equation:
dY is change in Y.
dt is change in time.
The population growth rate can measured by comparing the birth rate and the death rate in a population:
dN is change in population size.
dt is change in time.
B is the birth rate.
D is the death rate.
If a population is growing exponentially, you may use the following equation:
rmax is the maximum per capita growth rate of a population.
N is population size.
If a population is growing logistically, you may use the following equation:
K is the carrying capacity.
Equations for Surface Area and Volume
The surface area to volume ratio of a cell has a big effect on how efficiently it can exchange materials with its
environment. The table lists some commonly used surface area formulas and volume formulas for various shapes. In
these formulas, note the following:
h is height.
l is lengt
