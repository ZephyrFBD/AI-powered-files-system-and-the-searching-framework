2 (e) Fall apart. If the 
single electron in H2
+ is excited to the s*
1s orbital, its energy is higher 
than the energy of an H 1s atomic orbital and H2
+ will decompose 
into a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen ion. (f) Statement (i) is correct.

ing the same two bonded atoms, as bond order increases, bond energy 
increases. As bond order increases, bond length decreases. When 
comparing different bonded nuclei, there are no simple relationships.
(b) Be2 is not expected to exist; it has a bond order of zero and is not 
energetically favored over isolated Be atoms. Be2
+ has a bond order 
of 0.5 and is slightly lower in energy than isolated Be atoms. It will 
probably exist under special experimental conditions. 9.77 (a, b) 
Substances with no unpaired electrons are weakly repelled by a mag-
netic Ô¨Åeld. This property is called diamagnetism. (c) O2
