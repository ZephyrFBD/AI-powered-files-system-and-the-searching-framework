1aq2 ¡ 4 Ag+1aq2 + 2 H2O1l2. Thus, a voltaic cell uti-
lizing this reaction could perform a maximum of 170 kJ of work in con-
suming 4 mol Ag, 1 mol O2, and 4 mol H+.
If a reaction is not spontaneous, ∆G is positive and E is negative. 
To force a nonspontaneous reaction to occur in an electrochemical 
cell, we need to apply an external potential, Eext, that exceeds # Ecell#. 
For example, if a nonspontaneous process has E = -0.9 V, then the 
external potential Eext must be greater than +0.9 V in order for the 
process to occur. We will examine such nonspontaneous processes in 
Section 20.9.
Electrical work can be expressed in energy units of watts times 
time. The watt (W) is a unit of electrical power (that is, rate of energy 
expenditure):
1 W = 1 J>s
Thus, a watt-second is a joule. The unit employed by electric util-
ities is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), which equals 3.6 * 106 J:
