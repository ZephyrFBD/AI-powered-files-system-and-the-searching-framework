discuss interesting applications
such as lasers and holography.
We mention these limitations of the Bohr model not to disparage it—for it
was a landmark in the history of science. Rather, we mention them to show why,
in the early 1920s, it became increasingly evident that a new, more comprehensive
theory was needed. It was not long in coming. Less than two years after de Broglie
gave us his matter–wave hypothesis, Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961; Fig. 28–1)
and Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976; Fig. 28–2) independently developed a new
comprehensive theory.
28–1 Quantum Mechanics—A New Theory
The new theory, called quantum mechanics, has been extremely successful. It
unifies the wave–particle duality into a single consistent theory and has success-
fully dealt with the spectra emitted by complex atoms, even the fine details. It
explains the relative brightness of spectral lines and how atoms form molecules.
It is also a much more general theory that covers al
