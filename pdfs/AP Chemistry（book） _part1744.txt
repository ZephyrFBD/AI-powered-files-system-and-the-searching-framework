As the temperature of the liquid increases, the particles move about more vig-
orously. The increased motion allows some particles to escape into the gas phase. As 
a result, the concentration of gas-phase particles above the liquid surface increases 
with temperature. These gas-phase particles exert a pressure called vapor pressure. We 
explore vapor pressure in Section 11.5. For now we just need to understand that vapor 
pressure increases with increasing temperature until it equals the external pressure 
above the liquid, typically atmospheric pressure. At this point the liquid boils—bub-
bles of the vapor form within the liquid. The energy required to cause the transition 
of a given quantity of the liquid to the vapor is called either the heat of vapor-
ization or the enthalpy of vaporization, ∆Hvap. For water, the heat of vaporization is 
40.7 kJ>mol.
