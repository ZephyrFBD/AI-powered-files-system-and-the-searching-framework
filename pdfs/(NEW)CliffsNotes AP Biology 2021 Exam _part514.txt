ain balance or to avoid pain, for
example), sweat glands (to cool the body), or cells in the stomach (to secrete gastrin in response to the smell of food,
perhaps).
3. Interneurons (or association neurons) are located in the spinal cord or brain and receive impulses from sensory
neurons or send impulses to motor neurons. Interneurons are integrators, evaluating impulses for appropriate
responses.
The transmission of a nerve impulse along a neuron from one end to the other occurs as a result of chemical changes
across the membrane of the neuron. The membrane of an unstimulated neuron is polarized, that is, there is a
difference in electrical charge between the outside and inside of the membrane. In particular, the inside is negative
with respect to the outside. Polarization is established by maintaining an excess of sodium ions
(Na+) on the outside and an excess of potassium ions (K+) on the inside. A certain amount of Na+and K+is always
leaking across the membrane, but Na+/K+ active-tr
