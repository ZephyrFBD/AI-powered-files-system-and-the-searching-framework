chnology, 
bacterial plasmid-based genetic transformation, enables students to manipulate genetic 
information in a laboratory setting to understand more fully how DNA operates. In 
this investigation, students will first acquire the tools to transform E. coli bacteria to 
express new genetic information using a plasmid system, and apply mathematical 
routines to calculate transformation efficiency. Students then have the opportunity to 
design and conduct an investigation to study transformation in more depth; for example, 
students can investigate whether bacteria take up more plasmids in some environmental 
conditions, and less in others. The investigation also provides students with the 
opportunity to review concepts that they have studied previously, including interactions 
between organisms and their environment (big idea 4), structure and function of cell 
membranes (big idea 2), and evolution and natural selection (big idea 1).
