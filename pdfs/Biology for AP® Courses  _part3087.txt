and makes the brain neutrally buoyant. CSF also functions to circulate chemical substances throughout the brain and into
the spinal cord.
The entire brain contains only about 8.5 tablespoons of CSF, but CSF is constantly produced in the ventricles. This creates
a problem when a ventricle is blocked—the CSF builds up and creates swelling and the brain is pushed against the skull.
This swelling condition is called hydrocephalus (“water head”) and can cause seizures, cognitive problems, and even death
if a shunt is not inserted to remove the fluid and pressure.

Brain
The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It includes the cerebral
cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. There are three different ways that a brain
