 ingenuity. The substances oxidized at the anode and reduced by the cathode 
determine the voltage, and the usable life of the battery depends on the quantities of 
these substances packaged in the battery. Usually, a barrier analogous to the porous bar-
rier of Figure 20.6 separates the anode and cathode half-cells.
Different applications require batteries with different properties. The battery 
required to start a car, for example, must be capable of delivering a large electrical cur-
rent for a short time period, whereas the battery that powers a heart pacemaker must be 
very small and capable of delivering a small but steady current over an extended time 
period. Some batteries are primary cells, meaning they cannot be recharged and must 
be either discarded or recycled after the voltage drops to zero. A secondary cell can be 
recharged from an external power source after its voltage has dropped.
