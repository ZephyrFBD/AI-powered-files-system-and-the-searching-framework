ithmic scale is used to represent pressure. The melting curve 
(blue line) of H2O is atypical, slanting slightly to the left with increasing pressure, indi-
cating that for water the melting point decreases with increasing pressure. This unusual 
behavior occurs because water is among the very few substances whose liquid form is 
more compact than its solid form, as we learned in Section 11.2.

Note that a linear scale is used to represent 
temperature and a logarithmic scale to 
represent pressure.

CHAPTER 11 Liquids and Intermolecular Forces
If the pressure is held constant at 1 atm, it is possible to move from the solid to 
liquid to gaseous regions of the phase diagram by changing the temperature, as we 
expect f
