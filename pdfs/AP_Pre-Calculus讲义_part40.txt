1.8.4 Common Factors of Numerator and Denominator 
We have adopted the convention that the numerator and denominator of a rational function 
have no factor in common.

1.8.5 Slant Asymptotes and End Behaviour 
If r(x) = P(x) / Q(x) is a rational function in which the degree of the numerator is one more 
than the degree of the denominator, we can use the Division Algorithm to express the 
function in the form
