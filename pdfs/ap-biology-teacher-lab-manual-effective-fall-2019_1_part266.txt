COMPARING DNA SEQUENCES TO 
UNDERSTAND EVOLUTIONARY 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BLAST
How can bioinformatics be used as a tool  
to determine evolutionary relationships and  
to better understand genetic diseases?
■ BACKGROUND
Between 1990–2003, scientists working on an international research project known as 
the Human Genome Project were able to identify and map the 20,000–25,000 genes 
that define a human being. The project also successfully mapped the genomes of other 
species, including the fruit fly, mouse, and Escherichia coli. The location and complete 
sequence of the genes in each of these species are available for anyone in the world to 
access via the Internet.
Why is this information important? Being able to identify the precise location 
and sequence of human genes will allow us to better understand genetic diseases. In 
addition, learning about the sequence of genes in other species helps us understand 
evolutionary relationships among organisms. Man
