of two bases to abstract protons. For example, consider the proton transfer that occurs 
when an acid HA dissolves in water:
 
HA1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ H3O+1aq2 + A-1aq2 
[16.9]
If H2O (the base in the forward reaction) is a stronger base than A-  (the conjugate base 
of HA), it is favorable to transfer the proton from HA to H2O, producing H3O+ and A-. As 
a result, the equilibrium lies to the right. This describes the behavior of a strong acid in 
water. For example, when HCl dissolves in water, the solution consists almost entirely of 
H3O+ and Cl -  ions with a negligible concentration of HCl molecules:
 
HCl1g2 + H2O1l2 ¡  H3O+1aq2 + Cl -1aq2 
[16.10]
H2O is a stronger base than Cl -  (Figure 16.4), so H2O acquires the proton to become 
the hydronium ion. Because the reaction lies completely to the right, we write Equa-
tion 16.10 with only an arrow to the right rather than using the double arrows for an 
equilibrium.
When A-  is a stronger base than H2O, the equilibrium lies to the
