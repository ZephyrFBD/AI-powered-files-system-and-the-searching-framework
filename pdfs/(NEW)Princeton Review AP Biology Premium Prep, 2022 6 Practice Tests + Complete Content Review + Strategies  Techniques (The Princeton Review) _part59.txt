would decrease the enzyme
activity levels. Options I and II would raise the levels and make the disease worse.

C
As shown in the graph, the amount of substrate has reached a saturation point and adding additional
substrate will not increase the rate further. The reaction rate will remain at the same high level.

D
The islands are separated by ocean. Allopatric speciation occurs when populations are isolated from each
other. The finch populations are far away from each other and are likely to mate only with those on the
same island. Choice (A) implies that the finches are able to cross between islands, and (B) refers to a
natural disaster. Neither is mentioned in the information provided. Choice (C) describes the finches
developing similar features, but they developed different types of beaks. Only (D) references the isolated
populations associated with allopatric speciation.

If meiosis occurred as it should, there should be 4 haploid gametes, each with one long and one shor
