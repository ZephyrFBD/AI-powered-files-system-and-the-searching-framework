Calculate the fraction of plasmid DNA you spread on the LB/amp plate. 
(Hint: Refer to the procedure and your notes. How many microliters of cells 
containing DNA did you spread onto the plate? What was the total volume of 
solution in the test tube? Did you add all the volumes?) 
c. Calculate the micrograms of plasmid DNA that you spread on  
the LB/amp plate. 
To answer this question, you multiply the total mass of plasmid DNA used times 
the fraction of plasmid DNA you spread on the LB/amp plate. 
DNA spread in μg = Total amount of DNA used in μg x fraction of DNA used 
What does this number tell you? 
3. Calculate transformation efficiency. 
Look at your calculations. Fill in the blanks with the correct numbers.  
Number of colonies on the LB/amp plate:  
Micrograms of plasmid DNA spread on the plate:  
Now calculate the efficiency of the transformation.
