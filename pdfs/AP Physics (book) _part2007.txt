 the outer surface of the 
membrane, and leaves behind an equal negative charge that lies on the inner 
surface of the membrane (Fig. 18â€“28). The fluids themselves remain neutral.
What keeps the ions on the membrane is their attraction for each other across 
the membrane. Independently,
ions tend to diffuse into the cell since their
concentration outside is higher. Both 
and 
diffusion tends to charge the
interior surface of the membrane negative and the outside positive. As charge
accumulates on the membrane surface, it becomes increasingly difficult for more
ions to diffuse:
ions trying to move outward, for example, are repelled by the
positive charge already there. Equilibrium is reached when the tendency to diffuse
because of the concentration difference is just balanced by the electrical potential
difference across the membrane. The greater the concentration difference, the
greater the potential difference across the membrane (

).
