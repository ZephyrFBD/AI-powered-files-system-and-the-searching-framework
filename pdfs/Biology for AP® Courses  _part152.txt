when two
atoms chemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together
first as the atoms form a chemical bond.
Electron Shells and the Bohr Model
It should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that
distinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has. In all electrically neutral atoms, the number of
electrons is the same as the number of protons. Thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic
number of electrons equal to its atomic number.
An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885â€“1962). The Bohr model shows the
atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from
the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing
the number
