ould have to increase to maintain the equilibrium condition. Thus, a 
sample of Mg1OH221s2 dissolves completely if sufficient acid is added, as we saw in Fig-
ure 4.9 (page 135).
As we have seen, the solubility of Mg1OH22 greatly increases as the acidity 
of the solution increases. Based on this observation we can make the following 
generalization:
In general, the solubility of a compound containing a basic anion (that is, the 
anion of a weak acid) increases as the solution becomes more acidic.
The solubility of PbF2 increases as the solution becomes more acidic, too, because F - is 
a base (it is the conjugate base of the weak acid HF). As a result, the solubility equilib-
rium of PbF2 is shifted to the right as the concentration of F - is reduced by protonation 
to form HF. Thus, the solution process can be understood in terms of two consecutive 
reactions:
PbF21s2 ∆ Pb2 +1aq2 + 2 F -1aq2 
[17.18]
F-1aq2 + H+1aq2 ∆ HF1aq2 
[17.19]
The equation for the overall process is
