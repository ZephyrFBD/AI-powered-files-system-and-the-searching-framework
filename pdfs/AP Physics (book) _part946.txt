 same ratio of 
for an average person of any
height, and the result in the following Example is then independent of the height
of the person.
Forces on your back. Calculate the magnitude and direc-
tion of the force
acting on the fifth lumbar vertebra as represented in Fig. 9–14b.
APPROACH We use the model of the upper body described above and shown
in Fig. 9–14b. We can calculate 
using the torque equation if we take the axis
at the base of the spine (point S); with this choice, the other unknown,
doesn’t
appear in the equation because its lever arm is zero. To figure the lever arms, we
need to use trigonometric functions.
SOLUTION For 
the lever arm (perpendicular distance from axis to line of
action of the force) will be the real distance to where the force acts (48 cm) mul-
tiplied by 
as shown in Fig. 9–14c. The lever arms for 
and 
can be seen from Fig. 9–14b to be their respective distances from S times 
tends to rotate the trunk counterclockwise, which we take to be positive.
