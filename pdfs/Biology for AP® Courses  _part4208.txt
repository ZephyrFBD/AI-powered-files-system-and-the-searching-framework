tropical wet forest biome. On the forest
floor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage. A layer of
trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopyâ€”the uppermost overhead layer of branches and
leaves. Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy. These layers provide diverse and complex habitats
for the variety of plants, fungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests. For instance, epiphytes are
plants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed. Epiphytes are found throughout tropical wet forest biomes.
Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter.
Some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle.
