ove molecules from regions of low 
concentration to regions of high concentration.
ENE-2.F
Describe the mechanisms 
that organisms use to 
transport large molecules 
across the plasma 
membrane.
ENE-2.F.1
The selective permeability of membranes 
allows for the formation of concentration 
gradients of solutes across the membrane.
ENE-2.F.2
The processes of endocytosis and exocytosis 
require energy to move large molecules into 
and out of cells—
a. In exocytosis, internal vesicles fuse with 
the plasma membrane and secrete large 
macromolecules out of the cell.
b. In endocytosis, the cell takes in 
macromolecules and particulate matter 
by forming new vesicles derived from the 
plasma membrane.
