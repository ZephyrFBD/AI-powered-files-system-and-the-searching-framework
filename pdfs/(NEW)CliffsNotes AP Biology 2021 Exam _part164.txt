bines in a dam) provides the energy
 
for the ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. The passage of
 
about 3 H+ is required to generate 1 ATP.
 
4. The Calvin cycle produces G3P using NADPH, CO2, and ATP. At
 
the end of the electron transport chain following PS I, electrons combine
 
with NADP+ and H+ to produce NADPH. With NADPH, ATP, and
 
CO2, 2 G3P are generated and subsequently used to make glucose or other carbohydrates, (CH2O)n.
Photorespiration
Because of its critical function in catalyzing the fixation of CO2in all
 
photosynthesizing plants, rubisco is the most common protein on Earth.

fixing capabilities, it is also able to fix oxygen. The fixation of oxygen, a process called photorespiration, leads to
two problems. The first is that the
CO2-fixing efficiency is reduced because, instead of fixing only CO2, rubisco fixes some O2as well. The second
problem is that the products formed when O2is comb
