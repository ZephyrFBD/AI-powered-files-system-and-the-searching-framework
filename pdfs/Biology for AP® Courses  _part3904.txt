he interleukin (IL), so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes (white
blood cells). Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition to being released
from cells after PAMP recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and
induce those cells to release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst.
A second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby
uninfected cells. One of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication. They also have other important
functions, such as tumor surveillance. Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and
reduce protein synthesis, signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating
immune cells.
In response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the ce
