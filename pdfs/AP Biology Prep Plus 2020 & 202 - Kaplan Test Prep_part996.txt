nducted a controlled greenhouse experiment to see what eﬀects
mycorrhizal colonization had on plant photosynthesis and respiration.
Her experimental design involved growing 10 plants in soil rich in
(D)
mycorrhizal fungal elements and 10 in the same soil that had been
sterilized to remove the fungi. She made periodic measurements of plant
photosynthesis and root respiration and calculated the mean rates for
each experimental treatment. Her results are shown below.
15. What conclusion can most reasonably be drawn from the data?
The presence of mycorrhizae increased photosynthesis and
respiration rates significantly.
(A)
The presence of mycorrhizae increased photosynthesis but
not respiration.
(B)
The presence of mycorrhizae increased respiration but not
photosynthesis.
(C)
The presence of mycorrhizae had no eﬀect on photosynthesis
or respiration.
(D)
16. Which of the following provides the most plausible reason for why
mycorrhizae have the influence they do on plant metabolic
processes?
