Figure 3.9 Overview: Active and Passive Transport
Passive Transport
Passive transport is the movement of molecules down a concentration
gradient from a region of high concentration to a region of low
concentration until equilibrium is reached. Examples of passive transport
are diffusion and osmosis.
There are two types of diffusion: simple and facilitated. Simple
diffusion does not involve protein channels, but facilitated diffusion does.
An example of simple diffusion is found in the glomerulus of the human
kidney, where solutes dissolved in the blood diffuse into Bowmanâ€™s
capsule of the nephron.
Facilitated diffusion requires a hydrophilic protein channel that will
speed up the passive transport of specific substances across the membrane;
see Figure 3.10. One type of channel transports sin
