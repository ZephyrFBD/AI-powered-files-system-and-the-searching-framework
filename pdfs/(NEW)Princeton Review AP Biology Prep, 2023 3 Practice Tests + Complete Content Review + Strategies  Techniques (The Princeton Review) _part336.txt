ay the helix is
opening, so it can build only until it hits a previously built stretch. Once the helix unwinds a bit more, it can build
another Okazaki fragment, and so on. These fragments are eventually linked together by the enzyme DNA ligase to
produce a continuous strand. Finally, hydrogen bonds form between the new base pairs, leaving two identical copies
of the original DNA molecule.
When DNA is replicated, we donâ€™t end up with two entirely new molecules. Each new molecule has half of the
original molecule. Because DNA replicates in a way that conserves half of the original molecule in each of the two
new ones, it is said to be semiconservative.
An interesting problem is that a few bases at the very end of a DNA molecule cannot be replicated because DNA
polymerase needs space to bind template DNA. This means that every time replication occurs, the chromosome
loses a few base pairs at the end. The genome has compensated for this over time, by putting bits of unimportant (or
