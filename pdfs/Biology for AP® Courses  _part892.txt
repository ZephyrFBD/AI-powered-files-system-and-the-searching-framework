n uses glycolysis,
TCA and ETC but finally give electrons to an
organic molecule.
d.
Fermentation uses glycolysis, TCA and ETC but
finally gives electrons to an organic molecule,
whereas anaerobic respiration uses only
glycolysis and its final electron acceptor is an
inorganic molecule.
37. What type of cellular respiration is represented in the
following equation, and why?
CO2 + H2 + NADH â†’CH4 + H2 O + NAD+
a.
Anaerobic respiration, because the final electron
acceptor is inorganic.
b.
Aerobic respiration, because oxygen is the final
electron acceptor.
c.
Anaerobic respiration, because NADH donates
its electrons to a methane molecule.
d.
Aerobic respiration, because water is being
produced as a product.
38. Would you describe metabolic pathways as inherently
wasteful or inherently economical, and why?
a.
Metabolic pathways are economical due to
feedback inhibition. Also, intermediates from
one pathway can be utilized by other pathways.
b.
Metabolic pathways are wasteful as they
perform
