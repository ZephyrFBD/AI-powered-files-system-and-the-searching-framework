the liver. This results from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes,
which remove glucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion. As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and
signal transduction, it triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane. This allows glucose to
enter the cell, where it can be used as an energy source. However, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those
in the kidneys and brain, can access glucose without the use of insulin. Insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to
fat in adipocytes and the synthesis of proteins. These actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall,
called a hypoglycemic “low sugar” effect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback
loop.
