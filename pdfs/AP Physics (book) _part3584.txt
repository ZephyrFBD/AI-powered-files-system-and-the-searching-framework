tates are normally occupied. That is, what we
thought was the vacuum is instead a vast sea of electrons in negative energy
states (Fig. 32–13a). These electrons are not normally observable. But if a photon
strikes one of these negative energy electrons, that electron can be knocked up to
a normal 
energy state as shown in Fig. 32–13b. Note in Fig. 32–13
that there are no energy states between 
and 
(because 
cannot be negative in the equation 
). The photon that
knocks an 
from the negative sea up to a normal state (Fig. 32–13b) must have
an energy greater than 
What is left behind is a hole (as in semiconductors,
Sections 29–7 and 29–8) with positive charge. We call that “hole” a positron, and
it can move around as a free particle with positive energy. Thus Fig. 32–13b
represents (Section 27–6) pair production:
The vast sea of electrons with negative energy in Fig. 32–13 is the vacuum (or
vacuum state). According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum is not empty, but
contains electrons an
