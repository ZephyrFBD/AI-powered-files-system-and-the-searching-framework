Can an argon atom undergo vibrational motion?
The vibrational and rotational motions possible in real molecules lead to 
arrangements that a single atom cannot have. A collection of real molecules there-
fore has a greater number of possible microstates than does the same number of ide-
al-gas particles. In general, the number of microstates possible for a system increases with 
an increase in volume, an increase in temperature, or an increase in the number of mole-
cules because any of these changes increases the possible positions and kinetic energies of 
the molecules making up the system. We will also see that the number of microstates 
increases as the complexity of the molecule increases because there are more vibra-
tional motions available.
Chemists have several ways of describing an increase in the number of microstates 
possible for a system and therefore an increase in the entropy for the system. Each way 
seeks to capture a sense of the increased f
