ifferent niche.
Restriction enzymes Enzymes, naturally occurring in bacteria, that cut
DNA at certain specific recognition sites.
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) Noncoding
regions of human DNA that vary from person to person. They can be
used to identify a single individual. Pronounced “riflips.”
Restriction fragments Fragments of DNA that result from the cuts made
by restriction enzymes.
Reverse transcriptase An enzyme found in retroviruses that facilitates the
production of DNA from RNA.
Rhizobium A symbiotic bacterium that lives in the nodules on roots of
specific legumes and that incorporates nitrogen gas from the air into a
form of nitrogen the plant requires.
Ribosomes The site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm.
RNA polymerase The enzyme that binds to the promoter in DNA and that
begins transcription.
RNA primer An already existing chain of RNA attached to DNA to which
DNA polymerase adds nucleotides during DNA synthesis.
