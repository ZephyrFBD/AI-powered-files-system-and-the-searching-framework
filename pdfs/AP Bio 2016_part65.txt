Diapause is the interruption of an organismâ€™s life cycle in response to environmental cues. The soil nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans is capable of entering adult reproductive diapause (ARD) when food is scarce. In 
C. elegans, individuals normally become reproductively mature 2 days after hatching and remain fertile for 18 days.
