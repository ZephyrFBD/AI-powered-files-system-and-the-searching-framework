xpect sex to segregate independently, this is the null hypothesis (H0). Each family has three children, so
there are four possible outcomes for each family:
1. three daughters
2. two daughters and a son
3. one daughter and two sons
4. three sons
Using some advanced math (that you don’t need to worry about), the probabilities for each of these is:
1. P(three females) = 12.5%
2. P(two females, one male) = 37.5%
3. P(one female, two males) = 37.5%
4. P(three males) = (1)(0.50)3 = 12.5%
Because there are 100 families, we expect 12.5 to have three females, 37.5 to have two females and a male, 37.5 to
have one female and two males, and 12.5 to have three males. This can be calculated by multiplying the probability
of each event by the total (100 in this case).
Next, we compare this expected data (E) to what actually happened (the observed data, O). Note that the total
numbers for observed and expected columns must be the same. To calculate an χ2 value, the formula (O – E)2/E is
calculated fo
