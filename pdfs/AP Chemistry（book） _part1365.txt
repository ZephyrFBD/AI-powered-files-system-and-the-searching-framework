tions of an H and a CH3 group are 
reversed in one compared to the other. The (S) compound is prescribed 
to treat patients who experience the pain of arthritis; the (R) compound 
has no beneficial effects in humans and, in fact, causes liver poisoning. 
These compounds belong to a special class of structural isomers called 
enantiomers that we will learn more about in Chapter 24. Much effort in 
the pharmaceutical industry goes into making, separating, and purify-
ing one isomer of a compound from other isomers.
9.1 ∣ Molecular Shapes
In Chapter 8 we used Lewis structures to account for the formulas of covalent com-
pounds. 
 (Section 8.5) Lewis structures, however, do not indicate the shapes of mole-
cules; they simply show the number and types of bonds. For example, the Lewis structure 
of CCl4 tells us only that four Cl atoms are bonded to a central C atom:
C
Cl
Cl
Cl
Cl
The Lewis structure is drawn with the atoms all in the same plane. As shown in Figure 9.1, 
however, the actual
