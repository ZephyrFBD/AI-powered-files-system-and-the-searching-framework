s of water. Wet 
the soil gently until water drips from 
the wicks. Then fill the reservoirs with 
the dilute fertilizer solution. Plant the 
seeds carefully — about six to a bottle,  
uniformly spaced on the surface, not  
buried in the soil.  
Figure 6. Cover with a light layer of 
vermiculite. Place the reservoirs — with 
fertilizer water, seeds on the surface of 
the soil, and a light layer of vermiculite  
on the soil — under the lights.  
Step 2 Each day, check your plants and make sure that the reservoirs are full, especially 
on Fridays. These reservoirs have enough volume to last a three-day weekend for small 
plants. 
As your plants grow, record your observations daily. Also try to identify a trait that you 
could measure or observe reliably. Look for variation in the plants you are growing and 
describe any you see in your notebook. Observe your classmates’ plants as well. Are 
there also variations in their plants? 
Note: Carefully read Steps 3–7 before the plants begin to
