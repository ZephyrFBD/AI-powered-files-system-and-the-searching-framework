 the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are
attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins
associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other. Recall that, in mitosis, homologous
chromosomes do not pair together. In mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end so that when they divide,
each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair. The synaptonemal complex,
a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the
entire length of the chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis. In synapsis, the
genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The synaptonemal complex
supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister homologous chromatids, a process
