ture), the intramolecular interactions within the chain (its sec-
ondary structure), and the overall shape of the complete molecule (its 
tertiary structure). Two important secondary structures are the A-helix 
and the B-sheet. The process by which a protein assumes its biologi-
cally active tertiary structure is called folding. Sometimes several pro-
teins aggregate together to form a quaternary structure.
CARBOHYDRATES AND LIPIDS (SECTIONS 24.8 AND 24.9) Car-
bohydrates, which are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones, are the 
major structural constituents of plants and are a source of energy in 
both plants and animals. Glucose is the most common monosaccha-
ride, or simple sugar. Two monosaccharides can be linked together by 
means of a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide. Polysaccha-
rides are complex carbohydrates made up of many monosaccharide 
units joined together. The three most important polysaccharides are 
starch, which is found in plants; glycogen, which is found in
