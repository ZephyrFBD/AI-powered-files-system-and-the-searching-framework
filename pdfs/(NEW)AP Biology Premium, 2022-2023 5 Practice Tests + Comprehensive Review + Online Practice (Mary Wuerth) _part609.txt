gy of the reaction. The shape of an
enzyme is specific to its substrate and crucial to its function. Enzymes bind to a substrate at the active site and form
an enzyme-substrate complex that lowers the activation energy of the reaction. Environmental factors can change the
shape of an enzyme and consequently change its function.
Peroxidase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, a by-product of cellular respiration. Peroxidase
can be obtained from many sources, including potatoes, liver, and turnips. In this lab, peroxidase from turnips is
used to catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidase catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide
according to the following reaction:
The rate of this reaction can be measured by the rate of the disappearance of the reactant or the rate of production
of the products. The chemical guaiacol has a high affinity for oxygen. When guaiacol binds to oxygen, it forms the
chemical tetraguaiacol, which is brown in color. The more oxygen pro
