If meiosis occurred as it should, there should be 4 haploid gametes, each with one long and one short
chromosome. None of the gametes look correct. There was a nondisjunction at Meiosis I, and the two long
homologous chromosomes failed to separate. This caused two gametes to get no copies of the long
chromosome and two gametes to get two copies. If the nondisjunction was in Meiosis II, then two of the
gametes would look normal and two of the gametes would have incorrect amounts of chromosomes. Barr
bodies are small and unviable, but they still have the correct number of chromosomes in them.

The location appears to be upstream of the transcription start site. This is the promoter region and is likely
important for polymerase binding and initiation of transcription. Without it, there would be no transcription
and subsequently there could not be any translation.

Dark fur would be caused by high expression of fursilla. The triggers for that high expression would be an
