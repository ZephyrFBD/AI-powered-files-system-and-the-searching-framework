e SI unit 
for viscosity is kg>m-s.
The viscosity of a liquid is related to how easily its molecules flow past one another. 
It depends on the attractive forces between molecules and on whether the shapes and 
flexibility of the molecules are such that they tend to become entangled (for example, 
long molecules can become tangled like spaghetti). For a series of related compounds, 
viscosity increases with molecular weight, as illustrated in Table 11.3.

The strong electrostatic attractions between cations and anions 
explain why most ionic compounds are solids at room tempera-
ture, with high melting and boiling points. However, the melting 
point of an ionic compound can be low if the ionic charges are 
not too high and the cation–anion distance is sufficiently large. 
For example, the melting point of NH4NO3, where both cation 
and anion are larger polyatomic ions, is 170 °C. If the ammonium 
cation is replaced by the even larger et
