d at which Michel-
son’s eight-sided mirror would have had to rotate to reflect
light into an observer’s eye by succeeding mirror faces 
(1 8 of a revolution, Fig. 22–10)?
21. (II) A student wants to scale down Michelson’s light-speed
experiment to a size that will fit in one room. An eight-
sided mirror is available, and the stationary mirror can be
mounted 12 m from the rotating mirror. If the arrangement
is otherwise as shown in Fig. 22–10, at what minimum rate
must the mirror rotate?
22–5 Energy in EM Wave 
22. (I) The 
field in an EM wave has a peak of 
What is the average rate at which this wave carries energy
across unit area per unit time?
23. (II) The magnetic field in a traveling EM wave has an rms
strength of 22.5 nT. How long does it take to deliver 365 J
of energy to 
of a wall that it hits perpendicularly?
24. (II) How much energy is transported across a
area
per hour by an EM wave whose E field has an rms strength
of
25. (II) A spherically spreading EM wave comes from an
