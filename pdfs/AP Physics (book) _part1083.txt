For different fluids,
the more viscous the fluid, the greater is the required force. The proportionality
constant for this equation is defined as the coefficient of viscosity,

Solving for 
we find
The SI unit for 
is
In the cgs system, the unit is 
which is called a
poise (P). Viscosities are often given in centipoise 
Table 10–3 lists the coefficient of viscosity for various fluids. The temperature 
is also specified, since it has a strong effect; the viscosity of liquids such as motor
oil, for example, decreases rapidly as temperature increases.‡
10–12 Flow in Tubes: Poiseuille’s
Equation, Blood Flow
If a fluid had no viscosity, it could flow through a level tube or pipe without a
force being applied. Viscosity acts like a sort of friction (between fluid layers
moving at slightly different speeds), so a pressure difference between the ends of
a level tube is necessary for the steady flow of any real fluid, be it water or oil in a
pipe, or blood in the circulatory system of a
