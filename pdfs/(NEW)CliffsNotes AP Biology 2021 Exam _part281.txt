r various

Turner syndrome results when there is nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes. Sperm will have either both sex
chromosomes (XY) or no sex chromosomes (O, used to indicate the absence of a chromosome). Similarly, eggs will
be either XX or O. When a normal X egg or sperm combines with an O sperm or egg, a Turner syndrome zygote,
XO, results. XO individuals are sterile females with physical abnormalities. Although the absence of a single
chromosome is usually fatal, missing the Y chromosome, with its few, male-necessary genes, is not nearly so
deleterious (Figure 8-8).
Klinefelter syndrome occurs when an XY or XX gamete, produced as a result of nondisjunction (as in Turner
syndrome), combines with a normal X gamete to produce an XXY individual. Because of the presence of a Y
chromosome, these individuals are male, but may be sterile. In addition, individuals may
