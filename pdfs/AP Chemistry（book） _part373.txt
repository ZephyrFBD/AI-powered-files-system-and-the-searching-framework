and indicate whether it is a metal, metalloid, or nonmetal: 
 
(a) potassium, (b) iodine, (c) magnesium, (d) argon, (e) sulfur.
 2.44 The elements of group 4A show an interesting change in 
properties moving down the group. Give the name and 
chemical symbol of each element in the group and label it as 
a nonmetal, metalloid, or metal.
 2.45 The structural formulas of the compounds n-butane and 
isobutane are shown below. (a) Determine the molecular for-
mula of each. (b) Determine the empirical formula of each. 
(c) Which formulas—empirical, molecular, or structural—al-
low you determine these are different compounds?
