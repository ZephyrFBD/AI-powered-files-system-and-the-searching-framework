o groups. Half of the
seeds are grown in green light and half of the seeds are
grown in red light. AÈ‡er two weeks, the average angles of
plant growth are compared among the groups.

3. Mycorrhizae are fungi that grow in a symbiotic association with
plant roots. Researchers were interested in knowing whether a
particular species of fungus, Tuber melanosporum, obtained
carbon from the soil or from its host plant (the hazel tree). They
added 13C to carbon dioxide in the air surrounding a hazel tree,
which was enclosed in a cylinder. Which of the following
experimental results most strongly supports the hypothesis that T.
melanosporum obtains carbon primarily from its host rather than
from the soil?
13C was found in high abundance in the soil surrounding the
plant and in T. melanosporum cells.
(A)
13C was found in the leaves of the hazel tree, but not at all in
the surrounding soil.
(B)
13C was found in the leaves of the hazel tree and in the
surrounding soil.
(C)
13C was found in the l
