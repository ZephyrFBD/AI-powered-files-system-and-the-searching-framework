Sample Exercise 1.10
Converting Units
If a woman has a mass of 115 lb, what is her mass in grams? (Use the relationships between units given on the back inside 
cover of the text.)
SOLUTION
Because we want to change from pounds to grams, we look for a 
relationship between these units of mass. The conversion factor 
table found on the back inside cover tells us that 1 lb = 453.6 g. 
To cancel pounds and leave grams, we write the conversion factor 
with grams in the numerator and pounds in the denominator:
Mass in grams = 1115 lb2a
453.6 g
1 lb
b = 5.22 * 104 g
The answer can be given to only three significant figures, the 
number of significant figures in 115 lb. The process we have used is 
diagrammed on the top right coulmn.
