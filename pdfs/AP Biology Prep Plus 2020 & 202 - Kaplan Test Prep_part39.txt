ment of life because of the variety of organic compounds it can
form.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Macromolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and
nucleic acids are examples of organic compounds that serve as
building blocks in all living organisms. These compounds are
discussed in detail later in this chapter.
FREE ENERGY IN LIVING SYSTEMS
All living things require the capture or harvest of free energy from the
environment to grow, reproduce, and maintain dynamic homeostasis.
However, living systems must also follow the laws of thermodynamics,
which means that entropy is always increasing. To balance the
movement toward entropy, organisms must take in more energy than is
used by the organism.
Though you do not need to memorize the specific steps of the reactions
that help living things to capture and use free energy, it is important to
remember that endergonic (energy-consuming) and exergonic (energy-
releasing) reactions are typically connected. For example, the catabolic
breakdown of
