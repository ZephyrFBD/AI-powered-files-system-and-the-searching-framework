duction is “LEO the lion says GER”: losing electrons is oxidation; 
gaining electrons is reduction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What is the reducing agent in the following reaction?
2 Br-1aq2 + H2O21aq2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ Br21aq2 + 2 H2O1l2
(a) Br-1aq2 (b) H2O21aq2 (c) H+1aq2 (d) Br21aq2 
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in the reaction
2 H2O1l2 + Al1s2 + MnO4
-1aq2 ¡ Al1OH24

20.2 ∣ Balancing Redox Equations
Whenever we balance a chemical equation, we must obey the law of conservation of 
mass: The amount of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation. 
(Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in any chemical reaction.) As we balance 
 
oxidation–reduction reactions, there is an additional requirement: The gains and losses 
of electrons must be balanced. If a substance loses a certain number of electrons during 
a reaction, another substance must gain that same number of electrons. (Electrons are
