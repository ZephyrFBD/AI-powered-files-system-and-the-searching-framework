me flow rate,
Eqs. 10–4.) The increased blood velocity past the opening to the vertebral artery
results in lower pressure (Bernoulli’s principle). Thus, blood rising in the verte-
bral artery on the “good” side at normal pressure can be diverted down into the
other vertebral artery because of the low pressure on that side, instead of passing
upward to the brain. Hence the blood supply to the brain is reduced.
Other Applications
A venturi tube is essentially a pipe with a narrow constriction (the throat). The
flowing fluid speeds up as it passes through this constriction, so the pressure is
lower in the throat. A venturi meter, Fig. 10–29, is used to measure the flow speed
of gases and liquids, including blood velocity in arteries. The velocity 
can be
determined by measuring the pressure 
and 
the areas 
and 
as well as
the density of the fluid. (The formula is given in Problem 56.)
