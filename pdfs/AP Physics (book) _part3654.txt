23. (II) Antiprotons can be produced when a proton with suffi-
cient energy hits a stationary proton. Even if there is enough
energy, which of the following reactions will not happen?
24. (III) In the rare decay
what is the kinetic
energy of the positron? Assume the 
decays from rest
and 
.
25. (III) For the decay 
calculate (a) the 
Q-value (energy released), and (b) the kinetic energy of
the p and 
assuming the 
decays from rest. (Use
relativistic formulas.)
