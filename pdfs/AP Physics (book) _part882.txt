29. (II) Determine the net torque on
the 2.0-m-long uniform beam shown
in Fig. 8–45. All forces are shown.
Calculate about (a) point C, the CM,
and (b) point P at one end.
26. (II) A person exerts a horizontal force of 42 N on the end
of a door 96 cm wide. What is the magnitude of the torque
if the force is exerted (a) perpendicular to the door and 
(b) at a 60.0° angle to the face of the door?
27. (II) Two blocks, each of mass m, are attached to the ends
of a massless rod which pivots as shown in Fig. 8–43.
Initially the rod is held in the horizontal position and then
released. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the 
net torque on this system when it is first released.
