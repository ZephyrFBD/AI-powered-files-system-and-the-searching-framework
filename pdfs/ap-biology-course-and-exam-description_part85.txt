scope of the course and the AP Exam.
SYI-1.D.5
Mitochondria have a double membrane. 
The outer membrane is smooth, but the 
inner membrane is highly convoluted, forming 
folds.
SYI-1.D.6
Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed sacs that 
contain hydrolytic enzymes. 
SYI-1.D.7
A vacuole is a membrane-bound sac that plays 
many and differing roles. In plants, a specialized
