es ceased. The outer
shelf population had a period approximating exponential
growth followed by a period of disturbance and decrease in
growth.
(A)
The coral populations on the inner shelf and mid shelf were
relatively stable during the study due to lack of disturbance.
The outer shelf population was aﬀected by more
disturbances and exhibited a classic logistic growth curve.
(B)
All three figures show classic exponential growth curves.
(C)
All three figures show classic logistic growth curves.

3. A researcher decided to create a trophic pyramid by modeling an
ecosystem with plants, caterpillars that eat the plants, and birds
that eat the caterpillars. Each part of the pyramid represents the
biomass of that level, with primary producers on the bottom. The
plants were first grown in low light, and the light intensity was
raised over time to the maximum intensity that doesn’t harm the
plants. How would the trophic pyramid most likely change over
the course of this experiment?
