Enzyme Structure
BINDING
Most enzymes are proteins with specific 3-D structures that allow them
to bind to very particular molecules (called substrate molecules) and
increase the rate of reactions between these molecules. In many cases,
enzymes bind to larger molecules and break them into smaller ones.
Enzymes can synthesize or break down molecules at a rate of thousands
or millions per second—they are extremely fast-acting! They allow
reactions to occur that either would not take place or would take place
far too slowly under normal conditions to be useful.
Enzymes are very specific for the molecules they bind to and the
reactions they catalyze. Each enzyme has a name that usually indicates
exactly what it does, and the name
