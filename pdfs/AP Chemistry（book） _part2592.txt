c, such as NaOH 
and NH3. However, our discussion up to this point in the chapter has indicated that ions 
can also exhibit acidic or basic properties. For example, we calculated Ka for NH4
+ and Kb 
for F - in Sample Exercise 16.17. Such behavior implies that salt solutions can be acidic or 
basic. Before proceeding with further discussions of acids and bases, let’s examine the 
way dissolved salts can affect pH.
Because nearly all salts are strong electrolytes, we can assume that any salt dissolved 
in water is completely dissociated. Consequently, the acid–base properties of salt solu-
tions are due to the behavior of the cations and anions. Many ions react with water to 
generate H+1aq2 or OH-1aq2 ions. This type of reaction is often called hydrolysis. The 
pH of an aqueous salt solution can be predicted qualitatively by considering the salt’s 
cations and anions.
An Anion’s Ability to React with Water
In general, an anion A- in solution can be considered the conjugate base of an a
