fying and justifying the role of experimental variables 
and controls. Teachers should also stress the difference between a controlled experiment and experimental 
controls or constants. 
Question 2 
What was the intent of this question? 
Question 2 focuses on the evolutionary history of mammals and on the role of the immune system in 
responding to infection by a specific pathogen. The question asks students to use the presence or absence 
of derived characters in milk to construct a cladogram indicating the evolutionary relationships of the 
mammals. Students were asked to justify the placement of the derived characters on the cladogram. 
Students were then asked to describe the activation of the immune system in response to the infection. 
Finally, students were asked to predict the most likely consequence for a nursing infant who is exposed to 
a pathogen to which the mother was exposed three months earlier and to justify their prediction with 
evidence. 
How well did students perf
