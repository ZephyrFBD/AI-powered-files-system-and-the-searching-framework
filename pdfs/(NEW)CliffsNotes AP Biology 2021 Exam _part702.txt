have major effects on ecosystems and the
biosphere, as follows:
1. El Ni単o (El Ni単o-Southern Oscillation) is an atmospheric and oceanic phenomenon that precedes changes in
weather patterns throughout the biosphere. During normal atmospheric conditions (La Ni単a), trade winds over the
equatorial Pacific blow strongly from east to west. As the wind blows, it pushes surface water in the same direction,
blowing it away from the west coast of South America. In its place, cold, nutrientrich water from below rises to the
surface (a process called upwelling ) along the South American coastline. The nutrients promote a bottom-up
ecological effect, stimulating algae growth first, then marine herbivores and fish. Sea birds eat the fish. But when an
El Ni単o occurs, the trade winds and upwelling stop, algae populations decline, and the collapse of the local food
web and local fish industry ensue. In contrast, many marine invertebrate populations skyrocket as they thrive on the
carcasses of dead sea
