ture as sodium chloride (Figure 8.3). (a) In this structure, 
how many O2- are in contact with each Ca2+ ion (Hint: Re-
member the pattern of ions shown in Figure 8.3 repeats over 
and over again in all three directions.) (b) Would energy be 
consumed or released if a crystal of CaO was converted to 
a collection of widely separated Ca—O ion pairs? (c) From 
the ionic radii given in Figure 7.8, calculate the poten-
tial energy of a single Ca—O ion pair that is just touching 
 
(the magnitude of electronic charge is given on the inside 
back cover). (d) Calculate the energy of a mole of such pairs. 
How does this compare to the lattice energy of CaO? (e) 
What factor do you think accounts for most of the discrep-
ancy between the energies in part (d)—the bonding in CaO 
is more covalent than ionic, or the electrostatic interactions 
in a crystal lattice are more complicated than those in a sin-
gle ion pair?
