 the fol-
lowing reaction:
 
 
Mg1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡  Mg1OH221s2 + 2 H21g2
 
 (a)  
Calculate the standard enthalpy change for this reaction.
 
 (b) Calculate the number of grams of Mg needed for this re-
action to release enough energy to increase the temperature 
of 75 mL of water from 21 to 79 °C.
 5.109 Burning methane in oxygen can produce three different 
 
carbon-containing products: soot (very fine particles of 
graphite), CO(g), and CO21g2. (a) Write three balanced equa-
tions for the reaction of methane gas with oxygen to produce 
these three products. In each case assume that H2O1l2 is the 
only other product. (b) Determine the standard enthalpies 
for the reactions in part (a). (c) Why, when the oxygen supply 
is adequate, is CO21g2 the predominant carbon-containing 
product of the combustion of methane?
 5.110 We can use Hess’s law to calculate enthalpy changes that 
cannot be measured. One such reaction is the conversion of 
methane to ethylene:
2 CH41g2 ¡ C2H41g2 + H21g2
