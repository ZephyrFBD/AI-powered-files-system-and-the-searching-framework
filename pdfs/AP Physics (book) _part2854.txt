int. Why does this help?
8. Is the image formed on the retina of the human eye upright
or inverted? Discuss the implications of this for our percep-
tion of objects.
9. The human eye is much like a cameraâ€”yet, when a camera
shutter is left open and the camera is moved, the image will
be blurred. But when you move your head with your eyes
open, you still see clearly. Explain.
10. Reading glasses use converging lenses. A simple magnifier
is also a converging lens. Are reading glasses therefore
magnifiers?
Discuss the similarities and differences
between converging lenses as used for these two different
purposes.
11. Nearsighted people often look over (or under) their glasses
when they want to see something small up close, like a cell
phone screen. Why?
12. Spherical aberration in a thin lens is minimized if rays are
bent equally by the two surfaces. If a planoconvex lens is
used to form a real image of an object at infinity, which
surface should face the object? Use ray diagrams to show
