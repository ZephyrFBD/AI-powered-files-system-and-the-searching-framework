chemical reactions. In this investigation the term 
is used to establish a standard for a reaction. Thus, when manipulating components of 
a reaction (in this case, substrate or enzyme), you have a reference to help understand 
what occurred in the reaction. The baseline may vary with different scenarios pertinent 
to the design of the experiment, such as altering the environment in which the reaction 
occurs. In this scenario, different conditions can be compared, and the effects of 
changing an environmental variable  (e.g., pH) can be determined. 
Rate can have more than one applicable definition because this lab has two major 
options of approach, i.e., using a color palette and/or a spectrophotometer to measure 
percent of light absorbance. When using a color palette to compare the change in a 
reaction, you can infer increase, decrease, or no change in the rate; this inference is 
usually called the relative rate of the reaction. When using a spectrophotometer (or 
other measurin
