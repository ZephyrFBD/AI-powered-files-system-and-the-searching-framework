How do the nucleus and the endomembrane system work together for protein synthesis?
a.
The endomembrane system processes and ships proteins specified by the nucleus. In the nucleus, DNA is
used to make RNA which exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell. The ribosomes on the rough
ER use the RNA to create the different types of protein needed by the body.
