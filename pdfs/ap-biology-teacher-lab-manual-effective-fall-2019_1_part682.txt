ide students through an investigation, ask them 
focused questions, and give them suggestions for further study. However, the expected 
outcome is unknown. This type of inquiry is referred to as structured inquiry and is 
suitable for introducing groups of scientifically na√Øve students to inquiry. In a guided 
inquiry investigation, the procedure for conducting the investigation is developed by 
the students. The second part of this lab, in which students select an environmental 
factor and explore its effect on transpiration, is an example of this type of inquiry. With 
experience, students will be able to investigate questions about transpiration that they 
themselves have formulated and use procedures of their own design to investigate 
answers. Such open inquiry is the ultimate goal of any biology program. (For more 
information about the different types of inquiry-based investigations, please refer to 
Chapter 4 in this manual.) 
In this investigation, students begin by exploring
