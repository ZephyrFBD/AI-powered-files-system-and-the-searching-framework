sation. In addition, medical research leading to the discovery of drugs to treat genetic
disorders or illnesses requires clinical studies using human patients. In some cases, these patients may suffer from
the side effects of the experimental treatment, while others, in the control group, may suffer because they do not
receive an effective new treatment. Although there may not be a right or wrong answer for these issues, you should
be prepared to discuss (by giving examples) the privacy, ethical, social, and legal issues that result from the
application of scientific and medical research to society.
Part IV: Modeling Meiosis
Like part I of this investigation, you use clay, pipe cleaners, socks, or beads to represent chromosomes. In this part,
however, you display the various stages of meiosis.
Part V: Crossing Over in Meiosis
Crossing over is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The process contributes
to genetic recombination and genetic variation among o
