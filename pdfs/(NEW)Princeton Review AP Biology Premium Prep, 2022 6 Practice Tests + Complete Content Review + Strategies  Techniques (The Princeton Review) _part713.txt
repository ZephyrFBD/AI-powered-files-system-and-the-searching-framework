inal product of the pathway inhibits the activity of the first
enzyme. When the supply of CTP is low, the pathway will continue to produce CTP.

B
This enzymatic phenomenon is an example of feedback inhibition. Feedback inhibition is the metabolic
regulation in which high levels of an enzymatic pathway’s final product inhibit the activity of its rate-
limiting enzyme. Transcription, (A), is the production of RNA from DNA. Dehydration synthesis, (C), is
the formation of a covalent bond by the removal of water. In photosynthesis, (D), radiant energy is
converted to chemical energy.

C
The biosynthesis of cytidine 5’-triphosphate requires a nitrogenous base, three phosphates, and a sugar
ribose. Pyrimidines are a class of nitrogenous bases with a single ring structure. The sugar they contain is
ribose, which is shown in the pathway diagram.

Most r-strategists die early in their lifetime, (A), but most k-strategists live long lives and then die when
old. Humans are an example o
