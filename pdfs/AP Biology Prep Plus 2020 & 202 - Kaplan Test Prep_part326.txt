or, which is secreted by
α cells and diﬀuses from the α cell to the a cell. They also observed that
the a cell responded in two notable ways to the α factor. First, the a cell
radically reorganized its actin cytoskeleton to allow for the generation of
a “germ tube” towards the source of the α factor. Second, the expression
of several genes required for the mating process was activated. For
example, production of FUS1, a protein necessary to allow the fusion of
the nuclei, increased.
9. A sample of the yeast cells being studied is accidentally
contaminated with a bacterium known for producing a toxin that
inhibits DNA repair. Which of the following describes the most
likely response of the cells in this culture?
An inhibitory response resulting in the upregulation of pro-
apoptotic protein production
(A)
A stimulatory response resulting in the upregulation of pro-
apoptotic protein production
(B)
An inhibitory response resulting in the upregulation of DNA
repair protein production
(C)
