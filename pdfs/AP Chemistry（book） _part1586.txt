Further Applications of the  
Ideal-Gas Equation
In this section, we use the ideal-gas equation first to define the relationship between the 
density of a gas and its molar mass, and then to calculate the volumes of gases formed or 
consumed in chemical reactions.
Gas Densities and Molar Mass
Recall that density has units of mass per unit volume 1d = m>V2.  
 (Section 1.5) We 
can arrange the ideal-gas equation to obtain similar units of moles per unit volume:
n
V =
P
RT
If we multiply both sides of this equation by the molar mass, ℳ, which is the number of 
grams in 1 mol of a substance  
 (Section 3.4), we obtain
 
nℳ
V
= Pℳ
RT  
[10.9]
The term on the left equals the density in grams per liter:
moles
liter
*
grams
mole =
grams
liter
Thus, the density of the gas is also given by the expression on the right in Equation 10.9:
 
d = nℳ
V
= Pℳ
RT  
[10.10]
This equation tells us that the density of a gas depends on its pressure, molar
