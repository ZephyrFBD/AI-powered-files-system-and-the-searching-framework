rocesses. This can be done two different ways. Living organisms that rely on organic molecules for food are called
heterotrophs (consumers). For example, we’re heterotrophs, but the earliest heterotrophs were simple unicellular
life-forms. Heterotrophs metabolize carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, and then hydrolyze them as sources of free
energy. Eventually, some life-forms found a way to make their own food—most commonly through photosynthesis.
These organisms capture free energy present in sunlight and are called autotrophs (producers). Early autotrophs
(most likely cyanobacteria) are responsible for Earth’s oxygenated atmosphere.
The heterotroph hypothesis suggests that the first cells were likely heterotrophic and would have fed on organic
molecules that had been made without cells. These cells likely survived by performing processes similar to
glycolysis and fermentation. Once autotrophs were producing and releasing oxygen, aerobic respiration followed.
