nd functions as a source of light energy for photosynthesis.
(b) Plants capture light energy when photons excite electrons in pigments, such as chlorophyll.
(c) There would be less biomass and probably some dead plants and larvae on January 3rd.
(d) Without light energy, the plants could not perform photosynthesis. Without photosynthesis, there would be
no stored organic molecules for the larvae to eat.
12. (a) The genetic code is redundant: more than one codon can code for an amino acid. So two organisms could
have the exact same amino acid sequence for a protein but have slightly different DNA sequences in the
gene coding for the protein.
(b) The more homology (common sequences) between the DNA sequences of organisms, the more recently
they shared a common ancestor. This information could be used to develop phylogenetic trees.
(c)
(d) Morphology (body characteristics) and fossil evidence could also be used to generate phylogenetic trees.
