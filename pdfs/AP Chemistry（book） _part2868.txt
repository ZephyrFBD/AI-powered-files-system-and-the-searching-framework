ns having wavelengths shorter 
than 240 nm, ozone, O3, is the key absorber of photons whose wavelengths range 
from 240 to 310 nm, in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, as 
illustrated in Figure 18.4. Ozone in the upper atmosphere protects us from these 
harmful high-energy photons, which would otherwise penetrate to Earth’s sur-
face. Let’s consider how ozone forms in the upper atmosphere and how it absorbs 
photons.
By the time radiation from the Sun reaches an altitude of 90 km above Earth’s 
surface, most of the short-wavelength radiation capable of photoionization has been 
absorbed. Nevertheless, radiation capable of dissociating the O2 molecule is sufficiently 
intense for photodissociation of O2 (Equation 18.1) to remain important down to an alti-
tude of 30 km. In the region between 30 and 90 km, the concentration of O2 is much 
greater than the concentration of atomic oxygen. Consequently, the oxygen atoms 
formed by photodissociation of O2 in this region
