measures of variability (such as standard deviation, standard error, and range). The AP Biology Equations and
Formulas sheet contains definitions for mean, median, mode, and range. It also includes equations for mean,
standard deviation, and standard error. That said, you will not need to calculate standard deviation or standard error.
Instead, focus on understanding how these values are used.
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the data collected from samples, but may also describe the entire
population youâ€™re trying to study. Experiments are designed to include a sample, which is a subset of the
population being studied. The best experiments use random sampling, which makes sure there is no bias in
picking which individuals from the population will be included in the sample. It is important that the sample is big
enough that the data from the experiment is a good representation of what would happen if the whole population
were measured.
