rose. Starch and
glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. The long
polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas
amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch
of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or
creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell.
3.3 Lipids
Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils,
waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or
triglycerides. Fats are made up of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine. Fatty acids may be unsaturated or
saturated, depending on the presence or absence of double b
