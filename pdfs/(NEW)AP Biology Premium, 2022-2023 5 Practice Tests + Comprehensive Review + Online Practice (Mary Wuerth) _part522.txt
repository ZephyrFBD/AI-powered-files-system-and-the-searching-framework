in groups to ward off larger predators, like cobras.
Energy Flow Through Ecosystems
Organisms use energy to grow, reproduce, and maintain organization. Different species have different adaptations
for maintaining energy levels and body temperatures.
Endotherms use thermal energy generated from their metabolism to maintain their body temperature. Mammals
and birds are endotherms. Ectotherms do not have internal mechanisms for maintaining body temperature and
obtain heat from their environment. They must change their behaviors to regulate their body temperature. For
example, if a lizardâ€™s body temperature drops, it will move to a warm rock or into the sunlight to increase its body
temperature. Fish, reptiles, and amphibians are ectotherms.
Metabolic rate is the total amount of energy an organism uses per unit time. Smaller organisms generally have a
higher metabolic rate than larger organisms. As the size of an organism increases, its metabolic rate decreases. One
reason for this is that
