place an empty vial on top of the fly culture. Some flies will walk up into the empty vial, 
or students could turn the empty vial to the bottom and tap flies into the empty vial. 
Students must immediately plug the two vials. To toss flies into a choice chamber, they 
use the same technique to tap flies into the bottom of a culture and then quickly invert 
the culture into a funnel that is placed into one end of a choice chamber, making sure 
that the cap is on the other end of the chamber. Students then tap the culture to place at

will escape before it is plugged again. 
An additional technique to avoid the problem of flies escaping is to refrigerate them 
before the transfer
