t regulates 
transcription of GFP. Bla is the gene 
that codes for beta-lactamase, an 
enzyme that confers resistance to 
ampicillin by disabling ampicillin 
molecules. “Ori” is the plasmid’s origin 
of replication, and the arrows indicate 
the direction of transcription and 
translation. 
In addition to genes for green fluorescent protein and resistance to ampicillin, the pGLO 
plasmid has a special gene regulation system that switches on GFP production if the 
sugar arabinose is present in the nutrient medium, and the bacteria glow when exposed 
to UV light. This system is an example of an inducible operon.

Using the information above, ask students to construct a diagram of the arabinose 
operon, showing the activity of the various components described in the presence of 
arabinose, and then in the absence of the sugar. The following questions can guide their 
thinking: 
•  What evidence will indicate whether yo
