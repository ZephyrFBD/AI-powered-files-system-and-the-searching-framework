Much of the information in this section is outside the scope for AP®. You do not need to memorize a list of Earth’s different

Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learni
