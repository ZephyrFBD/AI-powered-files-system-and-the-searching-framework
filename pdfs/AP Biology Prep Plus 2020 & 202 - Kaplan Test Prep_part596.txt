omozygous-leȇ coiling male produces entirely right-coiling
oﬀspring. Based on these findings, which of the following
explanations is most probable?
The male snail does not contribute any genetic material
during fertilization in this species, meaning that the species
must be parthenogenetic.
(A)
The direction of shell coiling is controlled solely by
environmental factors, so the alleles contributed by the
mother and father do not aﬀect the shell morphology of the
oﬀspring.
(B)
During the earliest stages of development, only mRNA from
the male’s sperm is used for gene expression to determine
the direction of shell coiling.
(C)
During the earliest stages of development, mRNA from the
mother’s genes aﬀects the direction of shell coiling.
(D)
3. Researchers have found that a gene called Tbx5 is important in
vertebrate forelimb development. Activation of this gene can
occur along the entire region of the body where limbs develop.
However, a repressive complex including Hoxc9 prevents Tbx5
