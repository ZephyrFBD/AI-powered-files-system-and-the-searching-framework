tional hemoglobin for oxygen carrying. The diﬀerent forms of this
disease can be produced by a variety of mutations, including point
mutations, frameshiȇ mutations, and nonsense mutations.
The following diagram is useful for understanding these diﬀerent types of
mutations.

Transcription
Transcription is the process of “mirroring” a sequence of nucleotides on
an original strand of DNA with a strand of complementary bases of
mRNA (substituting uracil for thymine). Occurring in the nucleus,
transcription starts at a special region called a promoter and ends at
another special region called a terminator. The mRNA then undergoes a
sequence of post-transcriptional modifications. For reasons not fully
understood, the original DNA contains many regions that are not coded
for in protein synthesis. These regions are called introns, and they are
excised before the mRNA enters the cytoplasm for protein translation.
Exons are the regions that code for protein synthesis in mRN
