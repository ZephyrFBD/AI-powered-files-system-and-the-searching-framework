complete or incorrect diagrams illustrating transcription and translation in prokaryotes,
have students refine or revise the diagrams and share the edited versions with classmates for critical
review.
Think About It
•
Many antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the ribosome. What is
the likely effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis?
•
Using a chart of codons, transcribe and translate the following DNA sequence (non-template strand): 5′-
ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3′. How can a single nucleotide change affect the protein produced from this
sequence and its function?
