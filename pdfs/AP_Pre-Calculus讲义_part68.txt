l bacterium count in a culture is 500. A biologist later makes a sample count of 
bacteria in the culture and finds that the relative rate of growth is 40% per hour.  
(a) Find a function that models the number of bacteria after t hours.  
(b) What is the estimated count after 10 hours? 
(c) After how many hours will the bacteria count reach 80,000? 
(d) Sketch the graph of the function n(t). 
 
 
 
 
 
2.10.4 The Richter Scale 
In 1935 the American geologist Charles Richter (1900–1984) defined the magnitude M of 
an earthquake to be  
= log I
M
S  
where I is the intensity of the earthquake (measured by the amplitude of a seismograph 
reading taken 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake) and S is the intensity of a 
“standard” earthquake (whose amplitude is 1 micron =10-4 cm.)

Example 3 
The 19 06 earthquake in San Francisco had an estimated magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter 
scale. 
In the same year a powerful earthquake occurred on the Colombia-Ecuador border that 
was fo
