originally.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 8;16
Angular momentum, like linear momentum, is a vector quantity. For a sym-
metrical object rotating about a symmetry axis (such as a wheel, cylinder, hoop,
or sphere), we can write the vector angular momentum as
(8;21)
The angular velocity vector 
(and therefore also ) points along the axis of rota-
tion in the direction given by the right-hand rule (Fig. 8–30b).
The vector nature of angular momentum can be used to explain a number 
of interesting (and sometimes surprising) phenomena. For example, consider a
person standing at rest on a circular platform capable of rotating without fric-
tion about an axis through its center (that is, a simplified merry-go-round). If 
the person now starts to walk along the edge of the platform, Fig. 8–31a, the 
platform starts rotating in the opposite direction. Why? O
