tages. In the first stage, the six-carbon ring of glucose is prepared
for cleavage (“splitting”) into two three-carbon molecules by investing two molecules of ATP to energize the separation.
(Don’t worry; the cell will get the investment of ATP back. It’s like the stock market: You have to invest money to,
hopefully, make money!) As glucose is metabolized further, bonds are rearranged through a series of enzyme-catalyzed
steps, and free energy is released to form ATP from ADP and free phosphate molecules. The availability of enzymes
can affect the rate of glucose metabolism. Two molecules of pyruvate are ultimately produced. High-energy electrons and
hydrogen atoms pass to NAD+, reducing it to NADH. Although two molecules of ATP were invested to destabilize glucose
at the beginning of the process, four molecules of ATP are formed by substrate-level phosphorylation, resulting in a net gain
of two ATP and two NADH molecules for the cell.
