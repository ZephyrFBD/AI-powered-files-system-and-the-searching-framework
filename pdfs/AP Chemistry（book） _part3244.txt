charge adheres to 
the electrodes. As the external source forces electrons from one electrode to the 
other, the PbSO4 is converted to Pb at one electrode and to PbO2 at the other.
alkaline Battery
The most common primary (nonrechargeable) battery is the alkaline battery (Fig-
ure 20.20). The anode is powdered zinc metal immobilized in a gel in contact with 
a concentrated solution of KOH (hence, the name alkaline battery). The cathode is 
a mixture of MnO21s2 and graphite, separated from the anode by a porous fabric. 
The battery is sealed in a steel can to reduce the risk of any of the concentrated KOH 
escaping.
The cell reactions are complex but can be approximately represented as follows:
Cathode:  
2 MnO21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 + 2 e- ¡ 2 MnO1OH21s2 + 2 OH-1aq2
Anode:      
      Zn1s2 + 2 OH-1aq2 ¡ Zn1OH221s2 + 2 e-
