shown act on different objects.
FIGURE 4;10 Another example of
Newton’s third law: the launch of a
rocket. The rocket engine pushes the
gases downward, and the gases exert
an equal and opposite force upward
on the rocket, accelerating it upward.
(A rocket does not accelerate as a
result of its expelled gases pushing
against the ground.)

Third law clarification. Michelangelo’s
assistant has been assigned the task of moving a block of marble using a sled
(Fig. 4–12). He says to his boss, “When I exert a forward force on the sled, the 
sled exerts an equal and opposite force backward. So how can I ever start it
moving? No ma
