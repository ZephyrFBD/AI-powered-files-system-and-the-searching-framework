(II) What would be the sound level (in dB) of a sound wave
in air that corresponds to a displacement amplitude of
vibrating air molecules of 0.13 mm at 440 Hz?
20. (II) (a) Estimate the power output of sound from a person
speaking in normal conversation. Use Table 12–2. Assume
the sound spreads roughly uniformly over a sphere centered
on the mouth. (b) How many people would it take to pro-
duce a total sound output of 60 W of ordinary conversation?
[Hint: Add intensities, not dBs.]
21. (III) Expensive amplifier A is rated at 220 W, while the more
modest amplifier B is rated at 45 W. (a) Estimate the sound
level in decibels you would expect at a point 3.5 m from a
loudspeaker connected in turn to each amp. (b) Will the
expensive amp sound twice as loud as the cheaper one?
*12–3 Loudness
*22. (I) A 5000-Hz tone must have what sound level to seem as
loud as a 100-Hz tone that has a 50-dB sound level? (See
Fig. 12–6.)
*23. (I) What are the lowest and highest frequencies that an ear
can det
