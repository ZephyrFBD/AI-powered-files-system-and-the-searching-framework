atoms or ions. The most stable (lowest-energy) arrangement is when the spins of elec-
trons on adjacent atoms or ions are aligned in the same direction, as in Figure 23.6(b). 
When a ferromagnetic solid is placed in a magnetic field, the electrons tend to align 
strongly in a direction parallel to the magnetic field. The attraction to the magnetic field 
that results may be as much as a million times stronger than that for a paramagnetic 
substance.
When a ferromagnet is removed from an external magnetic field, the interac-
tions between the elect
