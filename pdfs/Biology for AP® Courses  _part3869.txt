ry mechanism
occurs in flatworms which consists of two
tubules containing cells called flame cells. They
have a cluster of cilia that propel waste matter
down the tubules and out of the body.
37. How do contractile vacuoles work as excretory
systems in microorganisms?
a.
Contractile vacuoles excrete excess water and
waste by the process of endocytosis, in which
these vacuoles merge with cell membrane and
expel wastes into the environment.
b.
Contractile vacuoles excrete uric acid by the
process of exocytosis, in which water as well as
uric acid is excreted by contraction of a cell
when the vacuole merges with the cell
membrane.
c.
Contractile vacuoles excrete excess water and
uric acid by the process of endocytosis when the
vacuole merges with the cell membrane.
d.
Contractile vacuoles excrete excess water and
waste by the process of exocytosis, in which the
vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and
expel wastes into the environment.
