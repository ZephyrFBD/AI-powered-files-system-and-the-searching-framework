orrectly describe the action of a hydrophilic signal. Cyclic AMP is
a secondary messenger found in the cytoplasm, not on the surface of
a cell.
(B) The body temperature of an ectotherm increases with the
ambient temperature. A homeotherm or an endotherm can raise and
lower its body temperature to maintain a steady body temperature.
(C) This question focuses on the order of activity at the synapse. An
electrical impulse travels down the axon, causing voltage-gated
calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane to open. Calcium
ions flood into the terminal branch. This causes presynaptic vesicles
to fuse with the membrane and release their contents,
neurotransmitter, into the synapse.
(A) If malonate is a competitive inhibitor, it competes with the
enzyme (succinate dehydrogenase) for succinate. If malonate is a
noncompetitive inhibitor, increasing the concentration of succinate
will not increase the rate of reaction because the enzyme is being
inhibited by malonate.
(D) This region has th
