 standing wave
on the string because the speed of sound in air (
at 20°C) is different
from the speed of the wave on the string
which depends on the tension in the string and its mass per unit length.
NOTE The frequencies on the string and in the air are the same: the string and
air are in contact, and the string “forces” the air to vibrate at the same fre-
quency. But the wavelengths are different because the wave speed on the string
is different than that in air.

EXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 328, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Stringed instruments would not be very loud if they relied on their vibrating
strings to produce the sound waves since the strings are too thin to compress and
expand much air. Stringed instruments therefore make use of a kind of mechanica
