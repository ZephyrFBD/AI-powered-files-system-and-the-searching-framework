â–¶Practice Exercise 2
Compare the Lewis symbol for neon with the Lewis structure 
for methane, CH4. How many valence electrons are in each 
structure? How many bonding pairs and how many nonbond-
ing pairs does each structure have?
SOLUTION
Analyze The Lewis symbols for nitrogen and fluorine reveal that 
nitrogen has five valence electrons and fluorine has seven.
Plan We need to find a combination of the two elements that results 
in an octet of electrons around each atom. Nitrogen requires three 
additional electrons to complete its octet, and fluorine requires one. 
Sharing a pair of electrons between one N atom and one F atom will 
result in an octet of electrons for fluorine but not for nitrogen. We 
therefore need to figure out a way to get two more electrons for the 
N atom.
Solve Nitrogen must share a pair of electrons with three fluorine 
atoms to complete its octet. Thus, the binary comp
