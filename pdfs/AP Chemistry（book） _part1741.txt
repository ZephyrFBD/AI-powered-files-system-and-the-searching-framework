mercury, however, 
the situation is different. Mercury atoms can form bonds with one 
another but not with the glass. As a result, the cohesive forces are 
much greater than the adhesive forces and the meniscus is shaped 
like an inverted U.
must be supplied to increase the surface area of a given amount of 
water by 1 m2. Water has a high surface tension because of its strong 
hydrogen bonds. The surface tension of mercury is even higher 
14.6 * 10-1 J>m22 because of even stronger metallic bonds between 
the atoms of mercury.
On any surface molecule, 
there is no upward force to 
cancel the downward force, 
which means each surface 
molecule “feels” a net 
downward pull.
On any interior molecule, each force is 
balanced by a force pulling in the opposite 
direction, which means that interior 
molecules “feel” no net pull in any 
direction.

surface tension of water keeps the water strider from sinking.
