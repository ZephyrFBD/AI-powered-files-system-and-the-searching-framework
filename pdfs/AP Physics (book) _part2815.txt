†Although the effect is the same as for astigmatism in the eye (Section 25–2), the cause is different.
Off-axis astigmatism is no problem in the eye because objects are clearly seen only at the fovea, on
the lens axis.
Another aberration, distortion, is a result of variation of magnification at
different distances from the lens axis. Thus a straight-line object some distance
from the axis may form a curved image. A square grid of lines may be distorted
to produce “barrel distortion,” or “pincushion distortion,” Fig. 25–26. The former
is common in extreme wide-angle lenses.
