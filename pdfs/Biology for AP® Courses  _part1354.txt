ne dominant and one recessive phenotype.
Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) × (1/4) = 3/16.
The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR)
parents would yield the same F1 and F2 offspring as in the YYRR x yyrr cross.
The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line
up in random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore
the genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.
Forked-Line Method
When more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square method becomes unwieldy. For instance, examining
a cross involving four genes would require a 16 × 16 grid containing 256 boxes. It would be extremely cumbersome to
manually enter each genotype. For more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferr
