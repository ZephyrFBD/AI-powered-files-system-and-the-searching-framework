electrodes.
The electrodes are immersed in a solution or paste, such as a dilute acid, called
the electrolyte. Such a device is properly called an electric cell, and several cells 
connected together is a battery, although today even a single cell is called a 
battery. The chemical reactions involved in most electric cells are quite complicated.
Here we describe how one very simple cell works, emphasizing the physical aspects.
The cell shown in Fig. 18â€“3 uses dilute sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. One of
the electrodes is made of carbon, the other of zinc. The part of each electrode
outside the solution is called the terminal, and connections to wires and circuits
are made here. The acid tends to dissolve the zinc electrode. Each zinc atom leaves
two electrons behind on the electrode and enters the solution as a positive ion. The
zinc electrode thus acquires a negative charge. The electrolyte becomes positively
charged, and can pull electrons off the carbon electrode. Thus the carbon
