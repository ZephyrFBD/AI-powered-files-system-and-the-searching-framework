rth American,
and to some degree Eurasian, megafauna, or large animals, disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period. The
extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,000â€“12,000 years ago. In North America, the
losses were quite dramatic and included the woolly mammoths (last dated about 4,000 years ago in an isolated population),
mastodon, giant beavers, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats, and the North American camel, just to name a few. The
possibility that the rapid extinction of these large animals was caused by over-hunting was first suggested in the 1900s.
Research into this hypothesis continues today. It seems likely that over-hunting caused many pre-written history extinctions
in many regions of the world.
In general, the timing of the Pleistocene extinctions correlated with the arrival of humans and not with climate-change
events, which is the main competing hypothesis for these extinctions. The extinctions began in Austral
