Spherical Mirrors
Reflecting surfaces can also be curved, usually spherical, which means they form a
section of a sphere. A spherical mirror is called convex if the reflection takes place
on the outer surface of the spherical shape so that the center of the mirror surface
bulges out toward the viewer, Fig. 23–10a. A mirror is called concave if the reflecting
surface is on the inner surface of the sphere so that t
