 this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another.
The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each
other.

Atomic Number and Mass
Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an
element’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting
in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the
number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element’s mass number, as illustrated in this figure. Note that
the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass
can be u
