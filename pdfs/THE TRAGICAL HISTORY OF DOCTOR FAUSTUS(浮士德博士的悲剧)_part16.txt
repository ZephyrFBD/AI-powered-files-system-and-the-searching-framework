depriv'd of everlasting bliss?
O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands, Which strike<36> a terror to
my fainting soul!
FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate For being
deprived of the joys of heaven? Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,
And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess. Go bear these tidings to
great Lucifer: Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death By desperate
thoughts against Jove's deity, Say, he surrenders up to him his soul, So he
will spare him four and twenty years, Letting him live in all
voluptuousness; Having thee ever to attend on me, To give me whatsoever
I shall ask, To tell me whatsoever I demand, To slay mine enemies, and to
aid my friends, And always be obedient to my will. Go, and return to
mighty Lucifer, And meet me in my study at midnight, And then resolve
me of thy master's mind.
