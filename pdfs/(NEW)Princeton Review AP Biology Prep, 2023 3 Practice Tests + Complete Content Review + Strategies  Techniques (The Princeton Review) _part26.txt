low levels of DRKFR
(C) Low levels of LSFR and high levels of DRKFR
(D) Low levels of LSFR and low levels of DRKFR
14. Based on the data, which of the following most likely describes how the binding of proteins affects the
production of Fursilla transcript?
(A) Because Fursilla transcript levels change when certain proteins are overexpressed or unexpressed in the
cell, Fursilla must interfere with the other proteins.
(B) Because Fursilla transcript levels stay the same whether NEFR is overexpressed or unexpressed, NEFR
must bind inhibit the production of Fursilla transcript.
(C) Because Fursilla transcript levels decrease when LSFR is unexpressed in the cell, LSFR must compete for
the binding site or RNA polymerase.
(D) Because Fursilla transcript levels increase when DRKFR is unexpressed in the cell, DRKFR must compete
for the binding site of RNA polymerase.
15. An additional protein, Baldidog (BLD), was identified and found to interact with the DRKFR protein. Based
