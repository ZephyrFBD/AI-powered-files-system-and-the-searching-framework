directly in small bottles containing the liquid scintillator. This is particularly con-
venient for detection of 
rays from 
and 
which have very low energies
and have difficulty passing through the outer covering of a crystal scintillator or
Geiger tube. A PM tube is still used to produce the electric signal from the liquid
scintillator.
A semiconductor detector consists of a reverse-biased pn junction diode
(Section 29–9). A charged particle passing through the junction can excite electrons
into the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. The freed charges
produce a short electric current pulse that can be counted as for Geiger and 
scintillation counters.
Hospital workers and others who work around radiation may carry film badges
which detect the accumulation of radiation exposure. The film inside is periodically
replaced and developed, the darkness of the developed film being related to total
exposure (see Section 31–5).
