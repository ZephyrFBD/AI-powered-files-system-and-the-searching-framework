nge so far. Then, predict the consequences of continued
population change in the future.
a.
The water resources present on Earth has been
exceeded by the human population. If the human
population keeps increasing, the ecological
footprint of humans will increase far beyond the
ability of Earth to support human population and
our population could crash.
b.
The land area present on Earth to supply our
resources has been exceeded by the human
population. If the human population keeps
increasing, the ecological footprint of humans
will increase far beyond the ability of Earth to
support human population and our population
could crash.
c.
The land area present on Earth to supply our
resources has been exceeded by the human
population. If the human population keeps
increasing, the birth and death rates will
decrease and our population could crash.
d.
The water resources present on Earth has been
exceeded by the human population. If the human
population keeps increasing, the birth and death
