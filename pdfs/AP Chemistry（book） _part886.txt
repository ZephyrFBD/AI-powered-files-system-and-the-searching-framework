n of Energy
When solids are heated, they emit radiation, as seen in the red glow of an electric stove 
burner or the bright white light of a tungsten light bulb. The wavelength distribution of 
the radiation depends on temperature; a red-hot object, for instance, is cooler than a yel-
lowish or white-hot one (Figure 6.5). During the late 1800s, a number of physicists stud-
ied this phenomenon, trying to understand the relationship between the temperature 
and the intensity and wavelength of the emitted radiation. The prevailing laws of physics 
could not account for the observations.
In 1900, a German physicist named Max Planck (1858–1947) solved the  
problem 
by making a daring assumption: He proposed that energy can be either released or absorbed 
by atoms only in discrete “chunks” of some minimum size. Planck gave the name quantum 
(meaning “fixed amount”) to the smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed 
as electromagnetic radiation. He proposed that the energy,
