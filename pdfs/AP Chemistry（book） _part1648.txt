 10.1  Mars has an average atmospheric pressure of 0.007 atm. 
Would it be easier or harder to drink from a straw on Mars 
than on Earth? Explain. [Section 10.2]
 10.2  You have a sample of gas in a container with a movable pis-
ton, such as the one in the drawing. (a) Redraw the container 
to show what it might look like if the temperature of the gas 
is increased from 300 to 500 K while the pressure is kept con-
stant. (b) Redraw the container to show what it might look

like if the external pressure on the piston is increased from 
1.0 atm to 2.0 atm while the temperature is kept constant. 
 
(c) Redraw the container to show what it might look like if 
the temperature of the gas decreases from 300 to 200 K while 
the pressure is kept constant (assume the gas does not liq-
uefy). [Section 10.3]
