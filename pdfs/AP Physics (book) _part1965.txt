rrent is in a wire depends not only on the voltage
between its ends, but also on the resistance the wire offers to the flow of electrons.
Electron flow is impeded because of collisions with the atoms of the wire. We
define electrical resistance R as the proportionality factor between the voltage V
(between the ends of the wire) and the current I (passing through the wire):
(18;2)
Ohm found experimentally that in metal conductors R is a constant independent
of V, a result known as Ohm’s law. Equation 18–2,
is itself sometimes
called Ohm’s law, but only when referring to materials or devices for which R is
a constant independent of V. But R is not a constant for many substances 
other than metals, nor for devices such as diodes, vacuum tubes, transistors, and
so on. Even for metals, R is not constant if the temperature changes much: for 
a lightbulb filament the measured resistance is low for small currents, but 
is much higher at the filament’s normal large operating current that puts i
