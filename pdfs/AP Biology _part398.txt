EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN ANIMALS
******ebook converter DEMO Watermarks*******
â– 
Life began as tiny, primitive, single-celled organisms in the oceans. The
first multicellular eukaryotic organisms evolved about 1.5 billion years
ago. The appearance of each phylum of animal represents the evolution of
a new and successful body plan. These important trends include:
specialization of tissues, germ layers, body symmetry, cephalization, and
body cavity formation. Specifics of these trends are summarized in the
sections that follow. Table 10.3 also summarizes this information.
