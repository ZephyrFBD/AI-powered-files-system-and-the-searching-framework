 traf-
fic backs up behind the gates, as depicted in Figure 14.20(a). The rate at which cars can 
get to point 3 is limited by the rate at which they can get through the traffic jam at plaza 
A. Thus, step 1 is the rate-determining step of the journey along the toll road. If, however, 
all gates at A are functioning but one or more at B are not, traffic flows quickly through 
A but gets backed up at B, as depicted in Figure 14.20(b). In this case, step 2 is the rate- 
determining step.
In the same way, the slowest step in a multistep reaction determines the overall rate. By 
analogy to Figure 14.20(a), the rate of a fast step following the rate-determining step does 
not speed up the overall rate. If the slow step is not the first one, as is the case in Fig-
ure 14.20(b), the faster preceding steps produce intermediate products that accumulate 
before being consumed in the slow step. In either case, the rate-determining step governs the 
rate law for the overall reaction.
