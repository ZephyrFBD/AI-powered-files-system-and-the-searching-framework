onnecting axon. 
(B) The action potential travels through the 
synapse to the next connecting dendrite. 
(C) The action potential jumps the synapse to  
the next connecting dendrite. 
(D) The action potential causes a release of 
neurotransmitters that travel across the 
synapse. 
 
 
 
34. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) can be a serious threat to human health. 
There is evidence that S. aureus infections are 
common in hospitals and that MRSA have 
become resistant to other antibiotics besides 
methicillin. This suggests that the rapid evolution 
of resistance in the bacteria poses a serious 
public-health challenge. Which of the following 
best explains the ability of MRSA to evade 
existing drug therapies? 
(A) MRSA have very long generation times and 
very large population sizes. 
(B) MRSA develop new alleles by intentionally 
introducing specific mutations that will give 
them a selective advantage over other 
bacteria. 
(C) MRSA metabolize many drugs in their
