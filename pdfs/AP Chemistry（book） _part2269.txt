 Deriving the Rate Law for a Mechanism with a Fast Initial Step
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a mechanism with a fast initial step and 
asked to write the rate law for the overall reaction.
Plan The rate law of the slow elementary step in a mechanism de-
termines the rate law for the overall reaction. Thus, we first write 
the rate law based on the molecularity of the slow step. In this 
case, the slow step involves the intermediate N2O2 as a reactant. 
Experimental rate laws, however, do not contain the concentra-
tions of intermediates; instead they are expressed in terms of t
