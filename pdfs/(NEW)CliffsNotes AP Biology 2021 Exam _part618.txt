late the production of gametes (eggs and sperm) are similar in both sexes. For both
males and females, the hypothalamus monitors hormone levels in the blood and secretes gonadotropin releasing
hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and
luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones stimulate the gonads (testes in males, ovaries in females) to produce the
gametes. In both males and females, LH stimulates the production of sex hormones, testosterone in males, and
estrogen and progesterone in females. Also in both sexes, FSH stimulates the development of the gametes. In males,
it does this by stimulating gametogenesis in the seminiferous tubules; in females, it does this by stimulating the
development of an oocyte in a follicle. Positive and negative feedback loops in both males and females establish
levels of hormones that maintain the constant production of sperm in males and the cyclical release of eggs in
females.
