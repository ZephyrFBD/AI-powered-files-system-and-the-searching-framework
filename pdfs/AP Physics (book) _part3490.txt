Human Exposure to Radiation
We are constantly exposed to low-level radiation from natural sources: cosmic
rays, natural radioactivity in rocks and soil, and naturally occurring radioactive
isotopes in our food, such as 
Radon,
is of considerable concern today.
It is the product of radium decay and is an intermediate in the decay series from
uranium (see Fig. 30â€“11). Most intermediates remain in the rocks where formed,
but radon is a gas that can escape from rock (and from building material like
concrete) to enter the air we breathe, and damage the interior of the lung.
The natural radioactive background averages about 0.30 rem (300 mrem) per
year per person in the U.S., although there are large variations. From medical 
X-rays and scans, the average person receives about 50 to 60 mrem per year, giving
an average total dose of about 360 mrem (3.6 mSv) per person. U.S. government 
regulators suggest an upper limit of allowed radiation for an individual in the
general populace at about 10
