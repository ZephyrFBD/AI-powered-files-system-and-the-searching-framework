Genetic Variance
Natural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits, namely an organism’s genetic
code. Because alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected
for, while deleterious alleles may be selected against. Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. For example, if an
athlete works out in the gym every day, building up muscle strength, the athlete’s offspring will not necessarily grow up to
be a body builder. If there is a genetic basis fo
