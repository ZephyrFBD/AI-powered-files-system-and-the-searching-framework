lulose and chitin found in the cell walls of plants and fungi.
Question 3
This is a two-part question. In the first part, describe each cell organelle and its function. In the second part, explain
that partitioning metabolic functions into organelles serves primarily to separate the biochemical activities.
In addition, describe how the channels among layers of endoplasmic reticulum serve to create compartments as
well. Last, describe the packaging relationship between the ER and Golgi bodies.
Cellular Respiration
Review
Cellular respiration is the first major topic for which you apply your knowledge of chemistry. For the most part,
however, the chemistry is descriptive—that is, you won’t have to solve chemical equations or even memorize
structural formulas. Instead, you need to provide names of major molecules (usually just the reactants and the
products), describe their sequence in a metabolic process, and most important, describe how the process
accomplishes its metabolic objective.
