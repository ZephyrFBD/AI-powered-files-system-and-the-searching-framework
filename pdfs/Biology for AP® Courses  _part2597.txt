Like eukaryotes, plants contain cells with organelles in which specific metabolic activities take place. Unlike animals,
however, plants use energy from sunlight to form sugars during photosynthesis. In addition, plant cells have cell walls,
plastids, and a large central vacuole: structures that are not found in animal cells. Each of these cellular structures plays a
specific role in plant structure and function.
