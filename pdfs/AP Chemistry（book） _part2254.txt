(a) Is the proposed mechanism consistent with the equation 
for the overall reaction?  (b) What is the molecularity of each 
step of the mechanism?  (c) Identify the intermediate(s).
Rate Laws for Elementary Reactions
In Section 14.3, we stressed that rate laws must be determined experimentally; they can-
not be predicted from the coefficients of balanced chemical equations. We are now in a 
position to understand why this is so. Every reaction is made up of a series of one or more 
elementary steps, and the rate laws and relative speeds of these steps dictate the overall 
rate law for the reaction. Indeed, the rate law for a reaction can be determined from its 
mechanism, as we will see shortly, and compared with the experimental rate law. Thus, 
our next challenge in kinetics is to arrive at reaction mechanisms that lead to rate laws 
consistent with those observed experimentally. We
