it rounds a curve of constant radius. (c) A car slows down
while rounding a curve of constant radius.
*27. (III) A particle revolves in a horizontal circle of radius
1.95 m. At a particular instant, its acceleration is 
in a direction that makes an angle of 25.0° to its direction 
of motion. Determine its speed (a) at this moment, and 
(b) 2.00 s later, assuming constant tangential acceleration.

28. (I) Calculate the force of Earth’s gravity on a spacecraft 
2.00 Earth radii above the Earth’s surface if its mass is
1850 kg.

eration g has a magnitude of 
A 24.0-kg brass 
ball is transported to this planet. What is (a) the mass of the
brass ball on the Earth and on the planet, and (b) the weight
of the brass ball on the Earth and on the planet?
30. (II) At what distance from the Earth will a spacecraft trav-
