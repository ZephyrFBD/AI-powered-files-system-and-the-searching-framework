null hypothesis.
EVO-1.K.2
Allele frequencies in a population can be 
calculated from genotype frequencies.
RELEVANT EQUATION
Hardy-Weinberg Equation—
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
p + q = 1
where:
p = frequency of allele 1 in the population
q = frequency of allele 2 in the population
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
EVO-1
Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population over 
time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.L.1
Changes in allele frequencies provide evidence 
for the occurrence of evolution in a population.
EVO-1.L.2
Small populations are more susceptible 
to random environmental impact than 
large populations.
