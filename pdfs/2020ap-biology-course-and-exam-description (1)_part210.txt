Phylogeny
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-3.B.1
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms show 
evolutionary relationships among lineages—
a.	Phylogenetic trees and cladograms both 
show relationships between lineages, but 
phylogenetic trees show the amount of 
change over time calibrated by fossils or a 
molecular clock.
b.	Traits that are either gained or lost during 
evolution can be used to construct 
phylogenetic trees and cladograms—
  i.	 Shared characters are present in more 
than one lineage.
 ii.	 Shared, derived characters indicate 
common ancestry and are informative for 
the construction of phylogenetic
