roup, are the most important class of organic 
acids. The presence of delocalized p bonding in the conjugate base is a 
major factor responsible for the acidity of these compounds.
LEWIS ACIDS AND BASES (SECTION 16.11) The Lewis concept of 
acids and bases emphasizes the shared electron pair rather than the 
proton. A Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor, and a Lewis base is an 
electron-pair donor. The Lewis concept is more general than the Brøn-
sted–Lowry concept because it can apply to cases in which the acid is 
some substance other than H+, and to solvents other than water.
