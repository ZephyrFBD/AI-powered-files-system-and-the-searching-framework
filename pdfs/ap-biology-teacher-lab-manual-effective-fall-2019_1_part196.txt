servations about pollination in your lab notebook. Likewise, with separate bee sticks 
you can pollinate the plants from the larger population, but be careful to keep them 
separate from the selected population. 
Step 9 Maintain the plants through the rest of their life cycle. As the seedpods form be 
sure to limit each of the plants to 8 to 10 seedpods. Any more will likely result in poor 
seed quality. Once the seedpods start to turn yellow (about day 28–36), remove the 
fertilizer water from the reservoirs and allow the plants to dry for several days. After 
the plants and seedpods have dried (about a week later), harvest the seedpods from 
the selected population into a small paper bag for further drying. Be sure to record 
observations about the plants’ life cycle in your lab notebook. 
Step 10 Continue to monitor, pollinate, and maintain your control plants throughout the 
rest of their life cycle. Just be careful to keep the original population and the selected 
population separ
