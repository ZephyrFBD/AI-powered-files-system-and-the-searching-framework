such as the heart or brain is especially damaging.
A current of about 1 mA or more can be felt and may cause pain. Currents
above 10 mA cause severe contraction of the muscles, and a person may not be
able to let go of the source of the current (say, a faulty appliance or wire). Death
from paralysis of the respiratory system can occur. Artificial respiration can
sometimes revive a victim. If a current above about 80 to 100 mA passes across
the torso, so that a portion passes through the heart for more than a second or
two, the heart muscles will begin to contract irregularly and blood will not be
properly pumped. This condition is called ventricular fibrillation. If it lasts for
long, death results. Strangely enough, if the current is much larger, on the order
of 1 A, death by heart failure may be less likely,â€  but such currents can cause
serious burns if concentrated through a small area of the body.
It is current that harms, but it is voltage that drives the current. The seriou
