l, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now
satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number
of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or â€“1 (chloride anion) charge. Note that these transactions can
normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a
suitable recipient like a chlorine atom.
Figure 2.11 In the formation of an ionic compound, metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to achieve an
octet.
Ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges. For instance, positively charged sodium ions and negatively
charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride, or table salt, creating a crystalline molecule with
zero net charge.
Certain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), ions necessary for
