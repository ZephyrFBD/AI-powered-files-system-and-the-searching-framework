 between the plants watered with bottled water and the plants
watered with tap water.
Here’s another example: You want to test if dogs prefer dog food brand A over dog food brand B. The null
hypothesis would be that there will be no statistically significant difference between the number of dogs choosing
dog food brand A and the number of dogs choosing dog food brand B. If 100 dogs are presented with both dog food
brand A and dog food brand B, the null hypothesis would predict that 50 dogs would choose brand A and 50 dogs
would choose brand B.
Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test is a statistical test that is used to compare the observed results to the expected results in the
experiment. In AP Biology, the chi-square test is used to evaluate the null hypothesis, and it is often used in genetics
problems, in the lab on mitosis (Lab 7), and in the lab on animal behavior (Lab 12).
It is important to note that the chi-square test is used to compare primary or raw data, such as the number of
