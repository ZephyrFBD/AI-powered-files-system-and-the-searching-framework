 response
element (HRE), which triggers gene transcription and translation. The corresponding protein product can then
mediate changes in cell function.
Heat shock proteins (HSP) are so named because they help refold misfolded proteins. In response to increased
temperature (a “heat shock”), heat shock proteins are activated by release from the nuclear receptor/HSP complex. At
the same time, transcription of HSP genes is activated. Explain the role of heat shock in refolding misfolded proteins.
a.
Heat is a stimulus that prevents hormone binding.
b.
Heat is a stimulus that facilitates hormone binding.
c.
Heat is a stimulus that facilitates dissociation of receptor from HSP directly.
d.
Heat is a stimulus that facilitates binding of a hormone-receptor complex to a hormone response element.
Other lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin D and thyroxine, have receptors located in the
nucleus. The hormones diffuse across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear
