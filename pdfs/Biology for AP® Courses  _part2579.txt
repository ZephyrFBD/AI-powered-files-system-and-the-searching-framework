SCIENCE PRACTICE CHALLENGE QUESTIONS
78. That the uniformity of cell size in prokaryotes is
independent of the conditions of cell growth has long been
a puzzle. Suppose that cells grew for a random period of
time and then divided. The largest and smallest, by
sometimes dividing to make even larger or smaller cells,
would be expected to broaden the distribution of cell sizes,
as shown in the diagram on the left for a time, t2, after a
time t1. Competing claims are made to explain the fact,
however, that the distribution does not broaden: 1) There is
a “timer” that initiates cell division, and 2) there is a
volume threshold that, when reached, initiates cell
division. Recently (Amir, Phys. Rev. Lett, 2014), a third
model was suggested: From the end of the last cell
division to the next, the cell volume increases by a
constant value.
