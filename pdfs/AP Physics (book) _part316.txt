Problem 56.
54. A light plane is headed due south with a speed relative to
still air of 
After 1.00 h, the pilot notices that
they have covered only 135 km and their direction is not
south but 15.0° east of south. What is the wind velocity?
55. An Olympic long jumper is capable of jumping 8.0 m.
Assuming his horizontal speed is 
as he leaves the
ground, how long is he in the air and how high does he go?
Assume that he lands standing upright—that is, the same
way he left the ground.
56. Romeo is throwing pebbles gently up to Juliet’s window,
and he wants the pebbles to hit the window with only a
horizontal component of velocity. He is standing at the
edge of a rose garden 8.0 m below her window and 8.5 m
from the base of the wall (Fig. 3–49). How fast are the
pebbles going when they hit her window?
