external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in T-cell development. T-cells are immune cells that
bind to foreign macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the immune system. Normally, T-cells do
not target “self” proteins (those of their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. In order to develop
the ability to discriminate between self and non-self, immature T-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind
to so-called self proteins. If the T-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially
dangerous cell.
Apoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development. In vertebrates, for example, early stages of development
include the formation of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes (Figure 9.15). During the course of normal
development, these unneeded cells must be eliminated, enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form. A cell signaling
mechanism triggers
