fects transpiration rate. Using the axes provided, draw a 
curve that illustrates what you predict would be the rate of transpiration with increasing humidity and 
constant temperature. Justify the shape of the curve based on your prediction. 
(c) The curve below illustrates the rate of transpiration related to the percent of open stomata on the leaf of a 
particular plant. Explain why the curve levels off with increasing percentage of open stomata per area of the 
leaf. 
 
(d) The data below show the density of stomata on the leaf surfaces of three different species of plants. 
Describe the environments in which each plant most likely evolved. Justify your descriptions.
