▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the balanced equation for the reaction that occurs when 
ethanol, C2H5OH1l2, burns in air.
SOLUTION
When any compound containing C, H, and O is combusted, it re-
acts with the O21g2 in air to produce CO21g2 and H2O1g2. Thus, the 
unbalanced equation is
CH3OH1l2 + O21g2 ¡ CO2(g) + H2O1g2
The C atoms are balanced, one on each side of the arrow. Because 
CH3OH has four H atoms, we place the coefficient 2 in front of 
H2O to balance the H atoms:
CH3OH1l2 + O21g2 ¡ CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2
Adding this coefficient balances H but gives four O atoms in the 
products. Because there are only three O atoms in the reactants, 
we are not finish
