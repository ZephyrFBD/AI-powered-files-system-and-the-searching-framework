mple of aqueous chemistry at work in nature. 
Coral reefs are built by tiny animals called stony 
corals, which secrete a hard calcium carbonate 
exoskeleton. Over time, the stony corals build up 
large networks of calcium carbonate upon which 
a reef is built. The size of such structures can be 
immense, as illustrated by the Great Barrier Reef.

 17.1 ▶  The Common-Ion Effect  
Consider a specific example of Le 
Châtelier’s principle known as the common-
ion effect.
 17.2 ▶  Buffers Recognize the composition of 
buffered solutions and learn how they resist 
pH change when small amounts of a strong 
acid or strong base are added to them.
 17.3 ▶  Acid–Base Titrations Examine acid–
base titrations and explore how to determine 
pH at any point in an acid–base titration.
 17.4 ▶  Solubility Equilibria Use solubility-
product constants to determine to what 
extent a spa
