om your experimental data. Place
blocks of tissue (like potato cores) in solutions of different known
molarities. Determine at which molarity the sample neither gains nor
loses mass (crosses the x-axis). See page 311.
R = Pressure constant equals 0.0831 liter/MPa/mole K (which is on the
Reference Tables that you will have access to during the exam). Note
that one bar is approximately 1 atmosphere.

T = Temperature in degrees Kelvin equals 273 + °C of solution (which
is on the Reference Tables that you will have access to during the
exam).
This lab consists of three parts:
Part 1: Make artificial cells to study the relationship of surface area
to volume.
Part 2: Create models of living cells.
Part 3: Observe osmosis in living cells.
Part 1: Make artificial cells to study the relationship of
surface area to volume.
OBJECTIVE
Fashion “cells” from agar or gelatin stained with phenolphthalein. Explore
