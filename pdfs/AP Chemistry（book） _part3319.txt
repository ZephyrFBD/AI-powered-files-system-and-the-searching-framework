s fully charged? 
 
(b) If the LiCoO2 cathode has a mass of 10 g (when fully dis-
charged), how many coulombs of electricity can be deliv-
ered on completely discharging a fully charged battery?
 20.80  Li-ion batteries used in automobiles typically use a 
LiMn2O4 cathode in place of the LiCoO2 cathode found in 
most Li-ion batteries. (a) Calculate the mass percent lith-
ium in each electrode material. (b) Which material has a 
higher percentage of lithium? Does this help to explain 
why batteries made with LiMn2O4 cathodes deliver less 
power on discharging? (c) In a battery that uses a LiCoO2 
cathode, approximately 50% of the lithium migrates from 
the cathode to the anode on charging. In a battery that 
uses a LiMn2O4 cathode, what fraction of the lithium in 
LiMn2O4 would need to migrate out of the cathode to 
deliver the same amount of lithium to the graphite anode?
