this makes genetics more complex than
Mendel’s experiments and the Punnett square might suggest.
PEDIGREES
Pedigrees are family trees that enable us to study the inheritance of a
particular trait across many related generations. Males are typically
designated as squares on the pedigree, while females are designated as
circles. Those who phenotypically show a trait are shaded, while those
who carry a trait but do not show it are either half-shaded or given a dot
inside their circle or square.
In humans, genetic traits can be classified by whether they are
transmitted on autosomal chromosomes (numbers 1–22) or on sex
chromosomes (almost always the X, because the Y chromosome carries a
limited number of genes). In addition, traits can be dominant or
recessive. For the AP Biology exam, you should be familiar with the
characteristics of diﬀerent inheritance patterns so you can easily spot
patterns. (Note that sex-linked traits, including both X-linked and Y-
linked, count as non-Mendelian i
