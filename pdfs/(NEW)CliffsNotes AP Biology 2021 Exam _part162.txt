or the respiratory
processes in mitochondria. In both cases, carrier proteins for electron transport chains are embedded in
membranes. Also, enzymes for CO2processing occur in fluids adjacent to the membranes. Specifically, the enzymes
for CO2utilization in the Calvin
 
cycle occur in the stroma (outside the thylakoid membranes), while the
 
enzymes for CO2generation in the Krebs cycle occur in the matrix (inside the crista membranes).

Chemiosmosis in Chloroplasts
Chemiosmosis is the mechanism of ATP generation that occurs when energy is stored in the form of a proton
concentration gradient across a membrane. The process in chloroplasts is analogous to ATP generation in
mitochondria. The following four steps outline the process of photophosphorylation in chloroplasts (Figure 5-2):
1. H+ ions (protons) accumulate inside thylakoids. H+ are released into
 
the inside space (lumen) of the thylakoid when water is split by PS II
 
(see Figure 5-2, 1A). Also, H+ are carried from
