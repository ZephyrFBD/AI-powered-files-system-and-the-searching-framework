Figure 1. Inheritance of a particular condition over three generations of a family
(a) Describe the process in eukaryotes that ensures that the number of chromosomes will not double from parent to 
offspring when gametes fuse during fertilization.
(b) Explain how any one chromosome in individual 16 contains DNA that came from both individuals 1 and 2.
(c) Use the template figure of the pedigree and the allele designations B and b to indicate the genotypes of individuals 
2, 4, 8, and 18.
