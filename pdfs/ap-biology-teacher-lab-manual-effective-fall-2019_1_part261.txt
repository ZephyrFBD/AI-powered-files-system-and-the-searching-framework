e first link that appears and scroll down to the section “NCBI Reference 
Sequences.” 
3. Under “mRNA and Proteins,” click on the first file name “NM 001100.3.” 
4. Just below the gene title, click on “FASTA.” 
5. The nucleotide sequence displayed is that of the actin gene in humans. 
6. Copy the gene sequence and go to the BLAST homepage   
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).  
7. Click on “nucleotide blast” under the Basic BLAST menu. 
8. Paste the sequence into the box where it says “Enter Query Sequence.” 
9. Give the query a title in the box provided if you plan on saving it for later. 
10. Under “Choose Search Set,” select whether you want to search the human genome 
only, mouse genome only, or all genomes available. 
11. Under “Program Selection,” choose whether you want highly similar sequences or 
somewhat similar sequences. Choosing somewhat similar sequences will provide 
you with more results. 
12. Click BLAST.
