produce chemical compounds that elicit
avoidance behavior in non-injured salamanders.

stimulus and control results from treatment
involving non-injured salamanders.

Biologists have observed some animal species making
predator warning calls when no predator is in the area. In
one species of bird, for example, individuals appeared to
perform this behavior as a means for deceiving other birds
into fleeing from a food source that the bird making the
call was then better able to access.
In investigating the possibility that this bird species uses
false alarm calls to improve its access to food, the
following experiment was conducted. Researchers set up a
bird feeding table in a protected area to attract two species
of birds, species A and B
