The Pressure–Volume Relationship: Boyle’s Law
Gas volume increases as the pressure exerted on the gas decreases. Thus, an inflated 
weather balloon released at the Earth’s surface expands as it rises (Figure 10.4) because the 
pressure of the atmosphere decreases with increasing elevation.
The British chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) was the first person to investigate the 
quantitative relationship between the pressure of a gas and its volume. He found, for 
example, that decreasing the pressure of a gas to half its original value causes the volume 
to double. Conversely, doubling the pressure causes the volume to decrease to half its 
original value.
Boyle’s law, which summarizes these observations, states that:
The volume of a fixed quantity of gas maintained at constant temperature  
is inversely proportional to the pressure.
When two measurements are inversely proportional, one gets smaller
