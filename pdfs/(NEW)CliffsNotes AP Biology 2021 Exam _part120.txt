conversions occur, more energy becomes unusable, things become disorganized, and disorder or
randomness increases. That disorder is called entropy. Because energy is constantly moving from one form to
another, a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics is that entropy increases in the universe.
Energy conversions are usually discussed within the context of a system, such as a chemical reaction, a cell, a
multicellular organism, or a planet like Earth. It can be a closed system, where only energy transfers among specific
items are considered, or it can be an open system, in which exchanges of energy with the surroundings are included.
Living things and the earth are open systems because they receive energy from sunlight.
The energy in a system that is available for conversions is called its Gibbs free energy, and the change in free
energy that occurs as a result of a conversion is represented by Î”G. Not all of this energy, however, is actually
available for chemical reactions bec
