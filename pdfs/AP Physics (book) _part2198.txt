FIGURE 20–15 Force on charged
particles due to a magnetic field is
perpendicular to the magnetic field
direction. If is horizontal, then

Negative charge near a magnet. A nega-
tive charge 
is placed at rest near a magnet. Will the charge begin to move? Will
it feel a force? What if the charge were positive,
RESPONSE No to all questions. A charge at rest has velocity equal to zero.
Magnetic fields exert a force only on moving electric charges (Eq. 20–3).
