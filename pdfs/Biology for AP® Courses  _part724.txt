his field collaborate with other scientists, usually chemists, to
design drugs.
Consider statins for exampleâ€”which is the name given to the class of drugs that reduces cholesterol levels.
These compounds are essentially inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is
the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the levels of
cholesterol synthesized in the body can be reduced. Similarly, acetaminophen is an inhibitor of the enzyme
cyclooxygenase. While it is effective in providing relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of
action is still not completely understood.
How are drugs developed? One of the first challenges in drug development is identifying the specific
molecule that the drug is intended to target. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target.
Drug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying the target alone is not
sufficient; scientists also
