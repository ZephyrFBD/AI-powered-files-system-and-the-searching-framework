Section II
1.
(a) Organisms that share a more recent common ancestor have had less time during which mutations can
accumulate, so their proteins will have fewer amino acid differences than organisms that share a more
distant common ancestor.
(b)
(c) Chimpanzees have the fewest number of amino acid differences
