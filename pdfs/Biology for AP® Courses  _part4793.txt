pproach to protect individual species alone is
insufficient to address the negative impacts of human activities. More effective and widespread conservative efforts, such
as the establishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves, can be implemented. Preserves are areas of land set aside
with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that inhabit them. Habitat restoration is another tool for protecting
ecosystems and can improve the biodiversity of degraded ecosystems. Conservation has shown that ecosystems and the
species that inhabit them, including Homo sapiens, can persist and thrive when we recognize the benefits of preserving
Earth’s habitats.

Measuring Biodiversity
The technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the
planet’s species in an accessible way is close to feasibl
