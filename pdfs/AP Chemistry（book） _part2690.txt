▲ Figure 17.2 Buffer action. The pH of an HF>F- buffered solution changes by only a small amount 
in response to addition of an acid or base.
F- (center). The addition of OH- reduces 3HF4 and slightly increases 3F-4, whereas the 
addition of H+ reduces 3F-4 and slightly increases 3HF4.
It is possible to overwhelm a buffer by adding too much strong acid or strong base. 
We will examine this in more detail a little later in this chapter.
Give It Some Thought
(a)  
What happens when NaOH is added to a buffer composed of CH3COOH and
CH3COO-?
(b) What happens when HCl is added to this buffer?
Calculating the pH of a Buffer
Because conjugate acid–base pairs share a common ion, we can use the same procedures 
to calculate the pH of a buffer that we used to treat the common-ion effect in Sample 
Exercise 17.1. Alternatively, we can take an approach based on an equation derived from 
Equation 17.5. Ta
