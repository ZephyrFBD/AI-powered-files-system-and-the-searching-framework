nutes per fruit.
3.
Add 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.
4.
Remove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed
in a test tube or an appropriate container.
5.
Pour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. You should observe white, precipitated
DNA.
6.
Gather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.
Record your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial
whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit
produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several
pieces of each fruit.
Analyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your
results reproducible?
Draw a conclusion: Given what
