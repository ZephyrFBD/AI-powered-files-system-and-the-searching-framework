The importance of relativity is not simply that it gives more accurate results,
especially at very high speeds. Much more than that, it has changed the way we
view the world. The concepts of space and time are now seen to be relative, and
intertwined with one another, whereas before they were considered absolute and
separate. Even our concepts of matter and energy have changed: either can be
converted to the other. The impact of relativity extends far beyond physics. It has
influenced the other sciences, and even the world of art and literature; it has,
indeed, entered the general culture.
The special theory of relativity we have studied in this Chapter deals with
inertial (nonaccelerating) reference frames. In Chapter 33 we will discuss briefly
the more complicated “general theory of relativity” which can deal with non-
inertial reference frames.

An inertial reference frame is one in which Newton’s law of
inertia holds. Inertial reference frames move at constant velo
