oup.) [Section 22.8]
 22.10  (a) Draw the Lewis structures for at least four species that 
have the general formula
O

O
(a) The ionic radii are larger than the atomic radii because 
the ions have more electrons than their corresponding 
atoms.
(b) Atomic radii increase going down the group because of 
increasing nuclear charge.
(c) The ionic radii increase going down the group because 
of the increase in the principal quantum number of 
outermost electrons.
(d) Of these ions, Se2- is the strongest base in water be-
cause it is largest.
 
22.8  Which property of the third-row nonmetallic elements 
might be the one depicted below: (a) first ionization 
energy, (b) atomic radius, (c) electronegativity, (d) melt-
ing point, (e) XÂ¬ X single-bond enthalpy? [Sections 22.3,
