rd way to do this is to breed only
those animals that possess the desired traits (or that possess them to
the greatest extent). Selectively breeding cows with above-average
milk production would ensure that milk production increases in
subsequent generations. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because it
is unlikely that a characteristic as complex as milk production can be
tied to a single gene. (C) is incorrect because milk production is
unlikely to be governed only by a single gene with a simple Mendelian
inheritance pattern. (D) is incorrect because increasing genetic
diversity will not necessarily lead to higher milk production.

Mass extinctions, such as the one described in the question stem, open
a large number of niches for exploitation by the surviving species,
o»áen leading to adaptive radiation. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect
because organisms are not spontaneously generated; they evolve from
ancestral organisms that survive and reprodu
