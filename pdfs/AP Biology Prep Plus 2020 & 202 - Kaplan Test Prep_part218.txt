 will cause the animal to develop chronic low blood
sugar problems.
(C)
The transformed bacteria will eliminate the plasmid with the
gene for insulin secretion since it is no longer necessary.
(D)
6. It is also important for the scientists to consider the diﬀerent ways
that the transformed bacteria can share genetic information with
other strains and species of bacteria. Which of the following
correctly matches a way bacteria can increase their genetic
variation with its corresponding term?
Bacteria can transfer small fragments of DNA between
individual bacteria of the same species or diﬀerent species
via vertical transfer.
(A)
Bacteria can take up fragments of DNA from their external
environment that are usually present due to the death and
lysis of another bacterium via transposition.
(B)
Bacteria can transfer plasmids to other bacteria that may or
may not be closely related through direct cell-to-cell contact
via transformation.
(C)
Bacteria can transfer DNA when a bacteriophage acc
