ssess, which in turn is a function of temperature. This movement accounts for the diffusion of
molecules through whatever medium in which they are localized. A substance will tend to move into any space available
to it until it is evenly distributed throughout it. After a substance has diffused completely through a space, removing its
concentration gradient, molecules will still move around in the space, but there will be no net movement of the number of
molecules from one area to another. This lack of a concentration gradient in which there is no net movement of a substance
is known as dynamic equilibrium. While diffusion will go forward in the presence of a concentration gradient of a substance,
several factors affect the rate of diffusion.
•
Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the difference in concentration, the more rapid the diffusion. The
closer the distribution of the material gets to equilibrium, the slower the rate of diffusion becomes.

Mass of the molecules d
