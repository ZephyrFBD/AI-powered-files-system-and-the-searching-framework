3.10.4 Equations of Multiple of Angles 
When solving trigonometric equations that involve functions of multiples of angles, we first 
solve for the multiple of the angle, then divide to solve for the angle. 
 
Example 6 
Consider the equation 2 sin 3 − 1 = 0. 
(a) Find all solutions of the equation. 
(b) Find the solutions in the interval [0, 2).

3.11 Trigonometric and Polar Coordinates 
3.11.1 Definition of Polar Coordinates 
The polar coordinate system uses distances and directions to specify the location of a 
point in the plane. 
To set up this system, we choose a fixed point O in the plane c
