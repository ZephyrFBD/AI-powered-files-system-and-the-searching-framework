teering (“bond stress”)
• Denaturation concept [temp and/or pH] linked to decreased enzyme activity
(e.g. “denaturation” in context or  unfolding or  change in 3D shape, not “enzyme breaks down”)
• How temperature affects conformation
 
(increased temperature breaks specific bonds, e.g. hydrogen, Van der Waals, disulfide bridges)
• 
How pH affects conformation
 
(change  in H+ concentration  causes  a change  in specific bond interactions, e.g. hydrogen; ionic; R-group
interactions)
• Kinetics (increased  or decreased molecular  movement ) linked to effect on enzyme  activity
due to increase or decrease  in temperature  up to the optimum

Experimental design must be relevant to the data shown in the graphs
• What is measured (e.g. product formed or substrate used)
• 
How is it measured (titration or spectrophotometry or color change or bubbles counted, etc.)
• The independent variable (temperature/pH) is manipulated to produce  the results [at least
