red electron spins on different-type ions point in 
opposite directions but do not fully cancel out. (Section 23.1)
ferromagnetism A form of magnetism in which unpaired 
electron spins align parallel to one another. (Section 23.1)
first law of thermodynamics A statement that energy is 
conserved in any process. One way to express the law is that the 
change in internal energy, ∆E, of a system in any process is equal 
to the heat, q, added to the system, plus the work, w, done on 
the system by its surroundings: ∆E = q + w. (Section 5.2)
first-order reaction A reaction in which the reaction rate is 
proportional to the concentration of a single reactant, raised to 
the first power. (Section 14.4)
fission The splitting of a large nucleus into two smaller ones. 
(Section 21.6)
folding The process by which a protein adopts its biologically 
active shape. (Section 24.7)
force A push or a pull. (Section 1.4)
formal charge The charge an atom (in a molecule) would have if 
each bonding electro
