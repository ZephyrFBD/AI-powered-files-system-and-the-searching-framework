n top of each other, with
the oldest layers deeper and the youngest layers closer to the surface.
Older geological layers hold more “primitive” fossils. Below is a table
displaying diﬀerent major biological events that have occurred through
geologic time, the period in which these events occurred, and
approximately how many millions of years ago they happened. You are
not required to know the dates of these events, but be prepared to
analyze given data and investigate certain claims.
