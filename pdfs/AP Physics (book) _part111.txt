Physics, like other sciences, is a creative endeavor. It is
not simply a collection of facts. Important theories are
created with the idea of explaining observations. To be
accepted, theories are “tested” by comparing their predictions
with the results of actual experiments. Note that, in general,
a theory cannot be “proved” in an absolute sense.
Scientists often devise models of physical phenomena.
A model is a kind of picture or analogy that helps to describe
the phenomena in terms of something we already know.
A theory, often developed from a model, is usually deeper
and more complex than a simple model.
A scientific law is a concise statement, often expressed in
the form of an equation, which quantitatively describes a
wide range of phenomena.
Measurements play a crucial role in physics, but can
never be perfectly precise. It is important to specify the
uncertainty of a measurement either by stating it directly
using the 
notation, and/or by keeping only t
