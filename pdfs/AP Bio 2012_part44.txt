of both species? 
(A) Exchange of genetic information occurs 
through crossing over. 
(B) Viral transmission of genetic information 
required to synthesize tryptophan occurs. 
(C) Random assortment of chromosomes leads  
to genetic variation. 
(D) Errors in DNA replication lead to genetic 
variation. 
 
36. Sickle-cell anemia results from a point mutation 
in the HBB gene. The mutation results in  
the replacement of an amino acid that has a 
hydrophilic R-group with an amino acid that has  
a hydrophobic R-group on the exterior of the 
hemoglobin protein. Such a mutation would most 
likely result in altered 
(A) properties of the molecule as a result of 
abnormal interactions between adjacent 
hemoglobin molecules 
(B) DNA structure as a result of abnormal 
hydrogen bonding between nitrogenous 
bases 
(C) fatty acid structure as a result of changes in 
ionic interactions between adjacent fatty 
acid chains 
(D) protein secondary structure as a result of 
abnormal hydrophobic interacti
