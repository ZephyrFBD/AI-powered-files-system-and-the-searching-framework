ondary and tertiary structures.
Subsequent processing by the endoplasmic reticulum or a Golgi body may make final modifications before the
protein functions as a structural element or as an enzyme.

Mutations
A mutation is any sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule that does not exactly match the original DNA
molecule from which it was copied. Mutations can occur as a result of replication errors, or they may result from
environmental effects such as radiation (for example, ultraviolet or Xray) or reactive chemicals. Radiation or
chemicals that cause mutations are called mutagens. Carcinogens are mutagens that activate uncontrolled cell
growth (cancer).
As reviewed earlier in this chapter, there are various mechanisms for repairing damaged DNA. Damaged DNA that
is not repaired becomes a mutation. Although some mutations have no phenotypic effect, most are deleteriousâ€”that
is, they lead to a partial or complete loss of cell functionality. A mutation that occurs in a sex cel
