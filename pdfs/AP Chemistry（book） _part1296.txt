benzene. Many of these compounds are important in biochemistry, in pharmaceuticals, 
and in the production of modern materials.
Give It Some Thought
Each Lewis structure of benzene has three C “ C double bonds. Another 
hydrocarbon containing three C “ C double bonds is hexatriene, C6H8. A Lewis 
structure of hexatriene is

Experiments show that three of the C ¬ C bonds in hexatriene are shorter than the 
other two. Does this data suggest that hexatriene exhibits resonance structures?
As with NO3
- the actual structure of SO3 is an equal blend of all 
three. Thus, each S ¬O bond length should be about one-third 
of the way between the length of a single bond and the length of 
a double bond. That is, S ¬O should be shorter than single bonds 
but not as short as double bonds.
The SO3
2 -  ion has 26 electrons, which leads to a dominant 
Lewis structure in which all the S ¬ O bonds are single:
