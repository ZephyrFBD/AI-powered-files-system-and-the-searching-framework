(B) There used to be one population of black-bellied seedcracker;
now, there are two. The single population diverged because of a
change in food.
(B) There are three branches of birds that all evolved from an
ancestral bird in the middle at the bottom. Each vertical line
represents a long period of time when the environment did not
change, so, neither did the birds. However, at two different times in
the course of this history, two bird lineages evolved suddenly from
the ancestral bird lineage. (We can assume that the environment
changed suddenly during those times.) One gave rise to a new
species on the left; another gave rise to a new species on the right.
Once each new species arose, the environment remained the same
for a long time and the species did not change. The ancestral species
is still alive; it did not go extinct. None of the information leads you
to think that evolution occurred because of genetic drift.
(C) The cell cycle co
