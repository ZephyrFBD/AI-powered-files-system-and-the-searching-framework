l efficiency
to 42%, what must be the temperature of the heat source?
31. (III) A typical compact car experiences a total drag force 
of about 350 N at 
If this car gets 32 miles per
gallon of gasoline at this speed, and a liter of gasoline
releases about 
when burned,
what is the car’s efficiency?
3.2 * 107 J
(1 gal = 3.8 L)
55 mih.
20. (I) The exhaust temperature of a heat engine is 230°C. What
is the high temperature if the Carnot efficiency is 34%?
21. (I) A heat engine does 9200 J of work per cycle while absorb-
ing 25.0 kcal of heat from a high-temperature reservoir.
What is the efficiency of this engine?
22. (I) A heat engine’s high temperature 
could be ambient
temperature, because liquid nitrogen at 77 K could be 
and is cheap. What would be the efficiency of a Carnot
engine that made use of heat transferred from air at room
temperature (293 K) to the liquid nitrogen “fuel”(Fig.15–25)?
