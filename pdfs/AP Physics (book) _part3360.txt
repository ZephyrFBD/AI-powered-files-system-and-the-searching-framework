Energy release in 
decay. How much energy is released
when 
decays to 
by 
emission?
APPROACH We find the mass difference before and after decay,
The energy
released is 
The masses given in Appendix B are those of the neutral
atom, and we have to keep track of the electrons involved. Assume the parent
nucleus has six orbiting electrons so it is neutral; its mass is 14.003242 u. The
daughter in this decay,
is not neutral because it has the same six orbital elec-
trons circling it but the nucleus has a charge of 
However, the mass of this
daughter with its six electrons, plus the mass of the emitted electron (which makes
