Question 6 
Figure 1.  Radioactively labeled polypeptides 
In an experiment investigating the mechanism of protein secretion, researchers tracked the movement 
of radioactively labeled polypeptides in pancreatic cells. At various times after the labeling, samples of 
the cells were observed using an electron microscope to determine the location of the radioactively 
labeled polypeptides. Figure 1 summarizes the results at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes. The 
dark dots in the figure represent the radioactively labeled polypeptides. 
(a) Using the experimental results, describe the pathway that secretory proteins take from their synthesis 
to their release from the cell.  
Description (1 point) 
(Rough) ER  (vesicle) Golgi  Vesicle  Exocytosis/fusion with plasma membrane/outside cell  
(b) Predict what the results would be if mRNA were radioactively labeled instead of polypeptides.
