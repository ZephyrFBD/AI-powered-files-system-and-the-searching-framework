in one reference frame as in another, and that time passes at the
same rate in different reference frames. In classical mechanics, then, space and
time intervals are considered to be absolute: their measurement does not change
from one reference frame to another. The mass of an object, as well as all forces,
are assumed to be unchanged by a change in inertial reference frame.
The position of an object, however, is different when specified in different
reference frames, and so is velocity. For example, a person may walk inside a bus
toward the front with a speed of 
But if the bus moves 
with respect
to the Earth, the person is then moving with a speed of 
with respect to the
Earth. The acceleration of an object, however, is the same in any inertial
reference frame according to classical mechanics. This is because the change in
velocity, and the time interval, will be the same. For example, the person in the
bus may accelerate from 0 to 
in 1.0 seconds, so 
in the reference
frame of the
