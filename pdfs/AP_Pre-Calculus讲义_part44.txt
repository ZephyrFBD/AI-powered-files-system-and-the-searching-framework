Suppose c > 0. 
To graph y = f(x) + c, shift the graph of y = f(x) upward c units. 
To graph y = f(x) − c, shift the graph of y = f(x) downward c units. 
 
 
Example 1 
Use the graph of f(x) = x2 to sketch the following functions. 
(a) g(x) = x2 +3 
(b) h(x) = x2 -2

1.10.2 Horizontal Shifting 
Suppose c > 0. 
To graph y = f(x − c), shift the graph of y = f(x) to the right c units. 
To graph y = f(x + c), shift the graph of y = f(x) to the left c units. 
 
 
Example 2 
Use the graph of f(x) = x2 to sketch the following functions. 
(a) g(x) = (x +4)2 
(b) h(x) = (x -2)2
