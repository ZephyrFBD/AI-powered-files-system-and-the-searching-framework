airly similar to detecting an odor (olfaction), given that both taste and smell rely on chemical
receptors being stimulated by certain molecules. The primary organ of taste is the taste bud. A taste bud is a cluster of
gustatory receptors (taste cells) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae (singular: papilla) (illustrated
in Figure 27.10). There are several structurally distinct papillae. Filiform papillae, which are located across the tongue, are
tactile, providing friction that helps the tongue move substances, and contain no taste cells. In contrast, fungiform papillae,
which are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, each contain one to eight taste buds and also have
receptors for pressure and temperature. The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the
posterior margin of the tongue.
