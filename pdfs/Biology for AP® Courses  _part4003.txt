37. A person given a flu vaccine in November comes
down with a severe case of influenza in January. What can
you conclude about the flu vaccine and cross reactivity?
a.
The flu vaccine elicited antibodies in the
person’s body that were specific to a particular
flu virus. Unfortunately, the flu virus that
infected the person later in January was different
enough for cross reactivity to occur between the
virus antigens causing the infection.
b.
The flu vaccine suppresses antibodies in the
person’s body that were specific to a particular
flu virus. Unfortunately, the flu virus that
infected the person later in January was different
enough for cross reactivity to occur between the
virus antigens causing the infection.
c.
The flu vaccine suppresses antibodies in the
person’s body that were specific to a particular
flu virus. Unfortunately, the flu virus that
infected the person later in January was similar
enough for cross reactivity to occur between the
virus antigens causi
