e animals, but their numbers, worldwide distribution, and
unique ability to extract and utilize resources have a greater impact on the Earth than most other
organisms.
i.
The use of fossil fuels to supply energy needed for industry and to heat and cool homes has
resulted in a global increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is correlated with a rise in
global temperature and severe weather.
ii. The disposal of biological, industrial, and household wastes has significantly altered nutrient
cycling. These wastes have introduced either totally new, or otherwise rare, toxic molecules into
the environment that have significant adverse effects on humans and other species.
B. Global Effects on the Ecosystem
1. Biological Magnificationâ€”toxic chemicals being increased in concentration from one trophic level to
the next. Biomass from one level is created from a larger biomass from the trophic level before. Top-
level consumers are mostly affected. The best-known example is the use of DDT pes
