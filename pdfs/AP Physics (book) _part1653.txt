ropy of one part of the universe may decrease in any natural
process (see Example 15–14), the entropy of some other part of the universe
always increases by a greater amount, so the total entropy always increases.
Now that we finally have a quantitative general statement of the second law
of thermodynamics, we can see that it is an unusual law. It differs considerably
from other laws of physics, which are typically equalities (such as 
) or
conservation laws (such as for energy and momentum). The second law of ther-
modynamics introduces a new quantity, the entropy S, but does not tell us it is
conserved. Quite the opposite. Entropy is not conserved in natural processes.
Entropy always increases in time for real processes.

15–8 Order to Disorder
The concept of entropy, as we have discussed it so far, may seem rather abstract.
But we can relate it to the more ordinary concepts of order and disorder.
