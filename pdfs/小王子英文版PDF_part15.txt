never made any pictures except
those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside,
since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I
am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no
resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the littl e prince‘s height: in one
place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his
costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair­
to­middling.
In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something
that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps,
that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through t he walls of
boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown­ups. I have had to grow old.
