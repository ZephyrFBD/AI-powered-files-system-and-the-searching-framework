e A is not correct because
photosystem II occurs first. Choice C is not correct because both PS
I and PS II only occur in the light. Choice D is not correct because
both photosystems depend on chlorophyll a and the antenna
pigments. (ENE-1)
(A) The role of antenna pigments is to absorb light and pass it on to
chlorophyll a. Choice B is not correct because antenna pigments do
absorb light. Choice C is not correct because it is in fact NADP that
shuttles hydrogen from the light-dependent reactions to the light-
independent reactions. Choice D is not correct because the antenna
pigments do not store light; they pass it on to chlorophyll a. (ENE-1)
(D) You have likely completed a chromatography lab in your AP
Biology class. The lab described in this question demonstrated that
the green from the spinach actually contained a mixture of different
photosynthetic pigments that all separated during the process.
Choice A is not correct because the separation was physical; there
were no bonds bein
