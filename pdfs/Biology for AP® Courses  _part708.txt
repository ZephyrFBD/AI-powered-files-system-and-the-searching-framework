perform cellular work. Cells use ATP to perform
work by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions. ATP donates its phosphate group to
another molecule via a process known as phosphorylation. The phosphorylated molecule is at a higher-energy state and is
less stable than its unphosphorylated form, and this added energy from the addition of the phosphate allows the molecule to
undergo its endergonic reaction.

Many chemical reactions in cells occur spontaneously, but happen too slowly to meet the needs of a cell. For example,
a teaspoon of sucrose (table sugar), a disaccharide, in a glass of iced tea will take time to break down into two
monosaccharides, glucose and fructose; however, if you add a small amount of the enzyme sucrase to the tea, sucrose
