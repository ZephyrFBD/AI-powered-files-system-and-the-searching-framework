above the horizontal and covers a radius of 6.0 m. (a) What is
the velocity of the water coming out of each sprinkler head?
(Assume zero air resistance.) (b) If the output diameter of
each head is 3.0 mm, how many liters of water do the four
heads deliver per second? (c) How fast is the water flowing
inside the 1.9-cm-diameter pipe?

tube (open at both ends) contains
water, and the other alcohol. If the two fluids meet at
exactly the bottom of the

pumps blood to the body. Assuming that the inner surface
of the left ventricle has an area of 
and the maxi-
mum pressure in the blood is 120 mm-Hg, estimate the
force exerted by that ventricle at maximum pressure.
