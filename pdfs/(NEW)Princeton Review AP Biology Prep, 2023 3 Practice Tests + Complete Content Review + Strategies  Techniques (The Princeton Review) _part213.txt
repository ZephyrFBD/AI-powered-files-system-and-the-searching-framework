king cells in the pancreas
(C) Bacterial cells in a colony
(D) White blood cells
8. Paramecium is a single-celled protist that lives in freshwater habitats. In these conditions, Paramecium has
evolved strategies to handle the potential consequences of inhabiting this hypotonic environment. One of these
strategies could be
(A) contractile vacuoles, which expel water forcefully
(B) increased aquaporins in its cellular membrane
(C) many cilia covering its surface
(D) salt receptors on its surface to seek out less concentrated areas
9. A cotransporter is something that moves two substances across a membrane, one passively and the other
actively. The Na+K+ ATPase transports sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane against their
concentration gradients. This pump is not considered a cotransporter because
(A) ATP is produced through this transporter
(B) both ions are moved via active transport
(C) both ions are moved via passive transport
(D) ATP hydrolysis does not occur during t
