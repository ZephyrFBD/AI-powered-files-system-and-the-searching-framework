ly been identified living in thermal pools in Yellowstone National Park. The
thermal pools have average temperatures of 45Â°C, a pH of approximately 3.2, and high concentrations of sulfur-
containing compounds. To identify the organism, a microbiologist performs a series of tests to evaluate its structural
organization. The table below summarizes the microscopy data of the newly identified organism.
