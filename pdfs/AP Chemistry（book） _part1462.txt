but if you add two sine functions having opposite phases, they 
add destructively and cancel each other.
The idea of constructive and destructive interactions of 
wave functions is key to understanding the origin of bonding 
and antibonding molecular orbitals. For example, the wave 
function of the s
1s MO of H2 is generated by adding the wave 
function for the 1s orbital on one atom to the wave function for 
the 1s orbital on the other atom, with both orbitals having the 
same phase. The atomic wave functions overlap constructively in 
this case to increase the electron density between the two atoms 
(Figure 9.40). The wave function of the s
1s
*  MO of H2 is generated 
by subtracting the wave function for a 1s orbital on one atom 
from the wave function for a 1s orbital on the other atom. The 
result is that the atomic orbital wave functions overlap destruc-
tively to create a region of zero electron de
