57. A scientist is studying a population of lizards
with three different color phenotypes. The color
phenotype is controlled by a single gene with
two alleles: an incompletely dominant allele A
and a recessive allele a. The scientist collected
data on the color of 100 lizards. The data are
shown in the table.

To test the hypothesis that the population is at 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the scientist 
performed a chi-square test. 
Which of the following values is closest to the 
chi-square value the scientist calculated? 
(A)
0.1
(B)
1.9
(C) 18.3
(D) 23.1

58. Scientists compared the chemical structure of several molecules that various bacterial species use for quorum 
sensing. Quorum sensing is an ability some bacteria have to detect the number of related cells nearby. The 
chemical structure of some of these molecules found in certain species of bacter
