 hydro-
carbon in a hypothetical world where oxygen is not the 
combustion agent. The enthalpy of formation of CF41g2 is 
-679.9 kJ>mol. Which of the following two reactions is the 
more exothermic?
 
CH41g2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2 
CH41g2 + 4 F21g2 ¡  CF41g2 + 4 HF1g2
 5.97 At the end of 2012, global population was about 7.0 billion 
people. What mass of glucose in kg would be needed to 
 
provide 1500 Cal/person/day of nourishment to the global 
population for one year? Assume that glucose is metabolized 
entirely to CO21g2 and H2O1l2 according to the following 
thermochemical equation:
 
C6H12O61s2 + 6 O21g2 ¡ 6 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2 
∆H° = -2803 kJ
 
5.98 The automobile fuel called E85 consists of 85% ethanol and 
15% gasoline. E85 can be used in the so-called flex-fuel vehi-
cles (FFVs), which can use gasoline, ethanol, or a mix as fuels. 
Assume that gasoline consists of a mixture of octanes (differ-
ent isomers of C8H18), that the average heat of combustion 
of C8H181l2 is 54
