 from quite small (five to ten genes in all) to fairly
large (several hundred genes). The genetic material found within a virus
may be held on DNA or RNA, both of which can be found in either a
double-stranded or single-stranded state. The nucleic acid can be linear
or circular, and although the DNA is always found together in a single
chromosome, the RNA can be in several pieces. Viruses are considered to
be obligate intracellular parasites, meaning that they must live and
reproduce within another cell, where they act as a parasite, using the
host cell’s machinery to copy themselves or to make proteins encoded for
by their DNA or RNA. Independent of host cells, viruses conduct no
metabolic activity of their own.
LYTIC CYCLE
Some viruses contain the enzymes they need for replication of their
genome, stuﬀing these proteins into each “baby” virus as it is produced
by the host cell. Others do not travel with their proteins but rather make
them only when they are inside a host. The typical
