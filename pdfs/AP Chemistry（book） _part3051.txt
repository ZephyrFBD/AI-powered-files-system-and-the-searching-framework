 flows from the system 
to the surroundings). The change in entropy of the surroundings depends on how much 
heat is absorbed or given off by the system.
For an isothermal process, the entropy change of the surroundings is given by
 
∆Ssurr =
qsurr
T
=
-qsys
T
 
Because in a constant-pressure process, qsys is simply the enthalpy change for the reaction, 
∆H, we can write
 
∆Ssurr =
-∆Hsys

Calculate the change in the standard entropy of the system, ∆S°, for the synthesis of ammonia from N21g2 and H21g2 at 298 K:
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ¡ 2 NH31g2
Solve
Using Equation 19.8, we have:
Analyze We are asked to calculate the standard entropy change for 
the synthesis of NH31g2 from its constituent elements.
Plan We can make this calculation using Equation 19.8 and the 
standard molar entropy values in Table 19.1 and Appendix C.
Check: The value for ∆S° is negative, in agreement with our 
qualitative prediction based on the decrease in the number of 
molecules of gas during
