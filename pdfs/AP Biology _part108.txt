 apoptosis is basically similar in single-
celled yeast and in mammalian cells indicates that the mechanism for
apoptosis evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotic cells.

common ancestral cell.
Eukaryotic cells are particularly efficient because they are
compartmentalized by a selectively permeable endomembrane
system, which allows for the separation of different chemical
processes from each other.
The fluid-mosaic model describes a selectively permeable plasma
membrane that separates the cell from its environment but that also
allows for the regulated exchange of materials with the
environment.
A sufficiently high ratio of surface area (cell membrane) to volume
(cytosol) is necessary for the exchange of materials into and out of
the cell.
Cells communicate with each other and with the e
