tends to be 0 again.

Progress Curve for the  
Growth of a Pea Plant  
Figure A.16 
Suppose, now, that we try to imagine what the rate curve for the growth of this pea 
plant will look like. If you read through the preceding paragraph, you will have a rough 
description of it. In fact, it will look like the graph in Figure A.17.

Growth Rate of a Pea Plant

Notice from the two graphs that where the steepness of the progress curve gets larger, the 
corresponding rate curve turns upward. Similarly, when the slope of the progress curve 
decreases again, the rate curve turns downward. A rate curve that is turning up means, 
therefore, that the process is speeding up; a flat rate curve means that the process is going 
at a constant rate; and a rate curve th
