to the larvae. However, as you have seen with the Fast Plants, there is a difference 
between the biomass of a dry brussels sprout and its mass when it is fresh. Ask students 
to use the percentage of biomass in a living Fast Plant to estimate the amount of biomass 
in grams available in each fresh brussels sprout. 
â–  Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Designing and Conducting Your Investigation aims to provide an accessible entry point 
for students as they study the energetics of two model organisms. Together, these two 
organisms can provide a simple model of ecosystem energetics. This section is fairly 
explicit about procedure while not providing explicit descriptions of how to record 
or analyze the data that are collected. Likewise, the students are expected to make 
observations, to use resources to learn more about the organisms they are studying, and 
to ask questions while carrying out the pr
