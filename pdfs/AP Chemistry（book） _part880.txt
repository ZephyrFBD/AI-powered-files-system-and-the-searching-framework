other wave characteristics of electro-
magnetic radiation are due to the periodic oscillations in the intensities of the electric 
and magnetic fields associated with the radiation.
The speed of water waves can vary depending on how they are createdâ€”for example, 
the waves produced by a speed boat travel faster than those produced by a rowboat. In 
contrast, all electromagnetic radiation moves at the same speed, namely, the speed of light. As a 
result, the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation are always related in a 
straightforward way. If the wavelength is long, fewer cycles of the wave pass a given point 
per second, and so the frequency is low. Conversely, for a wave to have a high frequency, 
it must have a short wavelength. This inverse relationship between the frequency and 
wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is expressed by the equation
 
ln = c 
[6.1]
where l 1lambda2 is wavelength, n (nu) is frequency, and c is the speed of light.
