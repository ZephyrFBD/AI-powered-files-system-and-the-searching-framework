describe how you are manipulating the independent
variable.
In the Daphnia experiment, the different temperature values (5°C, 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C) represent six
experimental treatments.
In the experiment on physiological conditions, the experimental treatments are exercise and recovery at various
intervals following exercise.
3. Identify a control treatment. The control treatment, or control, is the independent variable at some normal or
standard value. The results of the control are used for comparison with the results of the experimental treatments.
In the Daphnia experiment, you choose the temperature of 20°C as the control because that is the average
temperature of the pond where you obtained the culture.
In the experiment on physiological conditions, the control is sitting, when the subject is not influenced by
exercising.
4. Use only one independent variable. Only one independent variable can be tested at a time. If you manipulate
two independent variables at the sam
