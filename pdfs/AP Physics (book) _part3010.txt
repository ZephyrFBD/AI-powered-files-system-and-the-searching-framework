. In 1913–1914, careful experiments were carried out by R. A.
Millikan. The results were fully in agreement with Einstein’s photon theory.
One other aspect of the photoelectric effect also confirmed the photon
theory. If extremely low light intensity is used, the wave theory predicts a time
delay before electron emission so that an electron can absorb enough energy to
exceed the work function. The photon theory predicts no such delay—it only
takes one photon (if its frequency is high enough) to eject an electron—and
experiments showed no delay. This too confirmed Einstein’s photon theory.

many visible light photons a 100-W lightbulb emits per second. Assume the bulb
has a typical efficiency of about 3% (that is, 97% of the energy goes to
