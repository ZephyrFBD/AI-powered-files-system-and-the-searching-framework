 reasoning, to advance scientific
knowledge. As is the case in this example, the conclusion from inductive reasoning can often become the premise
for deductive reasoning.
Decide if each of the following is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.
1.
All flying birds and insects have wings. Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air. Therefore,
wings enable flight.
2.
Insects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones. Therefore, insect pests will become more
problematic if global temperatures increase.
3.
Chromosomes, the carriers of DNA, separate into daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, DNA is the
genetic material.
4.
Animals as diverse as insects and wolves all exhibit social behavior. Therefore, social behavior must have an
evolutionary advantage for humans.
