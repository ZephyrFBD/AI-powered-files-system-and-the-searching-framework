 a crystal did indeed show the peaks and valleys of a diffraction pattern
(Fig. 25–37). Thus it was shown, in a single blow, that X-rays have a wave nature
and that atoms are arranged in a regular way in crystals. Today, X-rays are
recognized as electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the range of about
to 10 nm, the range readily produced in an X-ray tube.
X-Ray Diffraction
We saw in Sections 25–7 and 25–8 that light of shorter wavelength provides
greater resolution when we are examining an object microscopically. Since
X-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, they should in principle
offer much greater resolution. However, there seems to be no effective material
to use as lenses for the very short wavelengths of X-rays. Instead, the clever but
complicated technique of X-ray diffraction (or crystallography) has proved very
effective for examining the microscopic world of atoms and molecules. In
a simple crystal such as NaCl, the atoms are arranged in an orderly c
