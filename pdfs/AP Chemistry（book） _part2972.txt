Lactone
is used in the manufacture of plastics and pharmaceu-
ticals. 3-Chloroperbenzoic acid is shock-sensitive, how-
ever, and prone to explode. Also, 3-chlorobenzoic acid is 
a waste product. An alternative process being developed 
uses hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst consisting of tin 
deposited within a solid support. The catalyst is readily 
recovered from the reaction mixture. (a) What would 
you expect to be the other product of oxidation of the 
ketone to lactone by hydrogen peroxide? (b) What prin-
ciples of green chemistry are addressed by use of the pro-
posed process?
 18.58  The hydrogenation reaction shown here was performed 
with an iridium catalyst, both in supercritical CO2 (scCO22 
and in the chlorinated solvent CH2Cl2. The kinetic data for 
the reaction in both solvents are plotted in the graph. In 
what respects is the use of scCO2 a good example of a green 
chemical reaction?
