otons of light are necessary 
to stimulate the eye.
The retinal slowly reverts to its original form and reattaches 
to the opsin. The slowness of this process helps explain why in-
tense bright light causes temporary blindness. The light causes all 
the retinal to separate from opsin, leaving no molecules to absorb 
light.

While valence-bond theory helps explain some of the relationships among Lewis struc-
tures, atomic orbitals, and molecular geometries, it does not explain all aspects of bond-
ing. It is not successful, for example, in describing the excited states of molecules, which 
we must understand to explain how molecules absorb light, giving them color.
Some aspects of bonding are better explained by a more sophisticated model called 
molecular orbital theory. In Chapter 6 we saw that electrons in atoms can be
