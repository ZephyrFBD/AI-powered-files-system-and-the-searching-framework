r iron), a magnet cannot be made at all.
The striking similarity between the fields produced by a bar magnet and by 
a loop of electric current (Figs. 20–4b, 20–9) offers a clue that perhaps magnetic
fields produced by electric currents may have something to do with ferromagnetism.
According to modern atomic theory, atoms can be roughly visualized as having
electrons that orbit around a central nucleus. The electrons are charged, and so
constitute an electric current and therefore produce a magnetic field. But the
fields due to orbiting electrons end up adding to zero. Electrons themselves pro-
duce an additional magnetic field, almost as if they and their electric charge were
spinning about their own axes. And it is this magnetic field due to electron spin†
that is believed to produce ferromagnetism in most ferromagnetic materials.
It is believed today that all magnetic fields are caused by electric currents.
This means that magnetic field lines always form closed loops, unlike electr
