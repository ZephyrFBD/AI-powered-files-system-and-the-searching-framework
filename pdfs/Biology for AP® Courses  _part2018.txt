Additionally, scientists have found that the farther the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the
more likely it is that speciation will occur. This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental
factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate
is cooler than in the south; the types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits; also, the hunting
habits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. These variances can lead to evolved differences
in the owls, and speciation likely will occur.
Adaptive Radiation
In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each population finds a distinct niche or
isolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles
