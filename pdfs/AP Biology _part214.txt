The electron transport chain directly produces ATP.
Which of the following is correct about ATP production?
Oxygen is required in cell respiration to carry protons to the
citric acid cycle.
Substrate level phosphorylation is the mechanism by which
ATP is produced in oxidative phosphorylation.
ATP synthase uses the energy of an ion gradient to power ATP
synthesis.
ATP carries protons across the cristae membrane to create a
proton gradient in the cristae membrane.
Which of the following is correct about the processes shown?
The three circles represent three major processes in aerobic
respiration.
