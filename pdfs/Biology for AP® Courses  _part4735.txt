the basis for defining periods of geological history, so they typically occur
at the transition point between geological periods. The transition in fossils from one period to another reflects the dramatic
loss of species and the gradual origin of new species. These transitions can be seen in the rock strata. Table 38.2 provides
data on the five mass extinctions.

Table 38.2 This table shows the names and dates for the five mass extinctions in
Earth’s history.
The Ordovician-Silurian extinction event is the first recorded mass extinction and the second largest. During this period,
about 85 percent of marine species (few species lived outside the oceans) became extinct. The main hypothesis for its cause
is
