charge and 
extent of orbital overlap.
Bonding in O2 provides an interesting test case for molecular orbital theory. The 
Lewis structure for this molecule shows a double bond and complete pairing of electrons:
O
O
The short O ¬O bond distance (1.21 Å) and relatively high bond enthalpy 1495 kJ>mol2 
are in agreement with the presence of a double bond. However, Figure 9.43 tells us that 
the molecule contains two unpaired electrons and should therefore be paramagnetic, a 
detail not discernible in the Lewis structure. The paramagnetism of O2 is demonstrated 
in Figure 9.45, which confirms the prediction from MO theory. The MO description also 
correctly predicts a bond order of 2 as did the Lewis structure.
Going from O2 to F2, we add two electrons, completely filling the p*
2p MOs. Thus, 
F2 is expected to be diamagnetic and have an F¬F single bond, in accord with its Lewis 
structure. Finally, the addition of two more electrons to make Ne2 fills all the bonding 
and antibonding MOs. T
