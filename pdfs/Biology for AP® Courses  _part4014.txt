tibody molecules.
c.
The tremendous diversity of antibody molecules
that can be made results from post-translational
modifications of antibody polypeptide chains.
d.
Each antibody is encoded by its own unique
gene in the DNA, which explains how antibodies
can have different antigen binding properties.
52. How does an antibody molecule bind specifically to
one antigen but not to others?
a.
due to the presence of a specific antigen binding
site
b.
due to the constant region
c.
due to diversity of variable region
d.
due to the complete antibody structure
53. The human genome contains less than 50,000 genes,
yet a human has the capability of producing more than
1012different antibody molecules. How can this evidence
be used to support the claim that the human body has an
immune system that is both effective and efficient?
a.
There are so many different antibody molecules
that can be made, each of which can specifically
target a particular pathogen to destroy it. This
specificity makes the
