tantial amounts of ammonia-based 
fertilizers for croplands. Of all the chemical reactions that humans 
have learned to control for their own purposes, the synthesis of 
ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen is one of the 
most important.
In 1912, the German chemist Fritz Haber (1868–1934) developed 
the Haber process (Equation 15.6). The process is sometimes also 
called the Haber–Bosch process to honor Karl Bosch, the engineer who 
developed the industrial process on a large scale (Figure 15.5). The en-
gineering needed to implement the Haber process requires the use of 
temperatures (approximately 500 °C) and pressures (200 to 600 atm) 
that were difficult to achieve at that time.
The Haber process provides a historically interesting example of 
the complex impact of chemistry on our lives. At the start of World 
War I, in 1914, Germany depended on nitrate deposits in Chile for 
the nitrogen-containing compounds needed to manufacture explo-
sives. During the war, the Allied
