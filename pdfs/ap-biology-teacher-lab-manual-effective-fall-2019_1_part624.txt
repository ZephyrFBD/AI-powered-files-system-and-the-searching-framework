1. Do you remember earlier when you read that more than 99% of your DNA is the 
same as another personâ€™s DNA, and that the 1% difference is attributed to small 
differences in genetic code? Conduct independent research on how these small 
differences can be detected by molecular biologists. Begin by investigating unique 
repeat DNA sequences called variable tandem repeats (VNTRs), short tandem 
repeats (STRs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Prepare a mini-poster 
presentation for your classmates illustrating how these small differences can be 
used to individualize DNA from different organisms, including humans. Are the 
differences between you and other individuals in the genes themselves? If so, how 
do you account for the fact that everyone needs the same genes to produce your cell 
components and your organs, such as your liver and lungs?  
2. Often scientists have only a small amount of DNA available for analysis. The 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is another k
