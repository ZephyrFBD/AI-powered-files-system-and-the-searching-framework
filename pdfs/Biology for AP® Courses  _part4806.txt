cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal
poaching and timber extraction. This is a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics.
Limitations on Preserves
Some of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. Political and
economic pressures typically make preserves smaller, never larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult.
If the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve. In this case,
an area on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve.
Enforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching
and illegal resource extraction.
Climate change will create inevitable problems with the location of preserves. The species within them will migrate to
