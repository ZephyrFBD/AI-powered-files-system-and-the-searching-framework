chnological developments 
in the twentieth century, including remarkable new light sources, such 
as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that are now being used as high-quality, 
low-energy-consumption light sources in many applications, and lasers, 
which have revolutionized so many aspects of our lives. Quantum theory 
also led to the development of the solid-state electronics that are at the heart 
of computers, cellular telephones, and countless other electronic devices.
In this chapter, we explore quantum theory and its importance in chem-
istry. We begin by looking at the nature of light and how our description of 
light was changed by quantum theory. We will explore some of the tools used 
in quantum mechanics, the “new” physics that had to be developed to describe 
atoms correctly. We will then use quantum theory to describe the arrange-
ments of electrons in atoms—what we call the electronic structure of at-
oms. The electronic structure of an atom refers to the number of electrons i
