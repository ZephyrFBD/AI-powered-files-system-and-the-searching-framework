riction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs)
A restriction fragment is a segment of DNA that results when DNA is
treated with restriction enzymes. When scientists compared noncoding
regions (junk DNA) of human DNA across a population, they discovered
that the restriction fragment pattern is different in every individual.
These differences have been named restriction fragment length
polymorphisms or RFLPs, pronounced “riflips.” A RFLP analysis of
someone’s DNA gives a human DNA fingerprint that looks like a
barcode.
Each person’s RFLPs are unique, except in identical twins, and are
inherited in a Mendelian fashion. Because they are inherited in this way,
they can be used very accurately in paternity suits to determine, with
absolute certainty, if a particular man is the father of a particular child. In

addition, RFLPs are routinely used to identify the perpetrator in rape and
murder cases. DNA from the crime scene and the victim are compared
