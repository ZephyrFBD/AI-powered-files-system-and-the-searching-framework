y Area. Would a chair have started 
to slide on a floor with coefficient of static friction 0.25?
94. Two blocks made of different materials, connected by a thin
cord, slide down a plane ramp inclined at an angle to the
horizontal, Fig.4–76 (block B is above block A). The masses
of the blocks are 
and 
and the coefficients of fric-
tion are

(a) the acceleration of the blocks and
(b) the tension in the cord, for an
angle u = 32°.

95. A car starts rolling down a 1-in-4 hill (1-in-4 means that 
for each 4 m traveled along the sloping road, the elevation
change is 1 m). How fast is it going when it reaches the
bottom after traveling 55 m? (a) Ignore friction. (b) Assume
an effective coefficient of friction equal to 0.10.
96. A 65-kg ice skater coasts with no effort for 75 m until she
stops. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between her
skates and the ice is
how fast was she moving
at
