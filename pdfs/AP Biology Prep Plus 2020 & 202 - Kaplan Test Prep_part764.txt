Evaluate each answer choice. According to the phylogenetic tree,
Lophosteus and the Osteichthyans are adjacent on the tree, with
Janusiscus branching from both. This indicates that Lophosteus and
the Osteichthyans are more closely related than Janusiscus and the
Osteichthyans, so (A) is the correct answer. The tree shows that the
Acanthodians and Chondrichthyans are more closely related to each
other than to other groups on the tree, as are Lophosteus and the
Osteichyans. However, there is no scale given that indicates whether
one of these pairs is more closely related than the other, so (B) is
incorrect. (C) is incorrect because Entelognathus and the
Chondrichthyans are the two most distant groups on the tree since
they are separated by multiple branch points. (D) is also incorrect
because Rami
