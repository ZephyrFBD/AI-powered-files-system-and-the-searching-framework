 hormones and
toxins. These environmental factors can turn genes on and off, thereby
influencing the development and function of an organism. For example, during
unfavorable environmental conditions, some animals may enter quiescence, a
state of dormancy, by turning specific genes on and/or off to slow down their
metabolism. When favorable conditions return, quiescence ends.

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The control is the culture of a-type cells with no supernatant from the co-
culture (a−) added, meaning no pheromones were present.
(c) In a diﬀerent experiment, a culture of α-type cells was incubated with
and without yeast mating pheromone. The fold change (log 10) for ste 3
expression for α with and without pheromone was 7 and 0.7,
