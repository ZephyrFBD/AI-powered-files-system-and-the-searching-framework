(D) is correct because, for prokaryotes, all aspects of protein
generation, including transcription, translation, and post-translational
processing, occur in the cytosol. Various types of bacteria, such as
purple phototrophic bacteria, heliobacteria, and cyanobacteria utilize
photosynthesis to generate a usable form of energy, eliminating (A).
They use proteins called photosynthetic reaction centers, which
contain chlorophyll or chlorophyll-like molecules, to absorb light
energy, thereby kickstarting the photosynthetic process. In
eukaryotes, these proteins are called chloroplasts; however, in
prokaryotes, these proteins are embedded in the plasma membrane or
on surfaces known as photosynthetic membranes. (B) is incorrect
because peroxisomes are an example of a membrane-bound
organelle, so it is impossible for a prokaryote to contain one.
Additionally, lysosomes are responsible for the digestion of cells, using
the enzyme hydrolase, while peroxisomes utilize oxidation reactions
