umber. Thus, a quantum of  
energy, hn, is an 
extremely small amount. Planck’s rules regarding the gain or loss of energy are always the 
same, whether we are concerned with objects on the scale of our ordinary experience or 
with microscopic objects. With everyday objects, however, the gain or loss of a single quan-
tum of energy is so small that it goes completely unnoticed. In contrast, when dealing with 
matter at the atomic level, the impact of quantized  
energies is far more significant.

The Photoelectric Effect and Photons
A few years after Planck presented his quantum theory, scientists began to see its 
 
applicability to many experimental observations. In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879–
1955) used Planck’s theory to explain the photoelectric effect (Fig
