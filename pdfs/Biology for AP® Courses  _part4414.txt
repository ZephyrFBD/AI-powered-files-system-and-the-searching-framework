Defense Mechanisms against Predation and Herbivory
The study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations contained
within it. Species are not static, but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural selection and other
evolutionary forces. Species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory. These defenses may
be mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral.
Mechanical defenses, such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles, discourage animal predation and
herbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from being able to eat the prey.
Chemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants, such as the foxglove which is extremely toxic when
eaten. Figure 36.20 shows some organismsâ€™ defenses against predation and herbivory.
