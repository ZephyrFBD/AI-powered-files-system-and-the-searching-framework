n a beam of white light strikes this film at normal 
incidence from air, the only enhanced reflected colors are
red (650 nm) and violet (390 nm). From this information,
deduce the (minimum) thickness of the oil slick.
55. (III) A uniform thin film of alcohol 
lies on a  flat
glass plate 
When monochromatic light, whose
wavelength can be changed, is incident normally, the reflected
light is a minimum for 
and a maximum for
What is the minimum thickness of the film?
*24â€“9 Michelson Interferometer
*56. (II) How far must the mirror 
in a Michelson interfer-
ometer be moved if 680 fringes of 589-nm light are to pass
by a reference line?
*57. (II) What is the wavelength of the light entering an 
interferometer if 362 bright fringes are counted when the
movable mirror moves 0.125 mm?
*58. (II) A micrometer is connected to the movable mirror of an
interferometer. When the micrometer is tightened down on
a thin metal foil, the net number of bright fringes that move,
compared to closing the empt
