ment reflects a flexible response of
its genome. For example, gene expression and protein function can be affected by temperature. Phenotypic
plasticity occurs if two individuals with the same genotype have different phenotypes because they are in different
environments. Here are some examples of how the environment can influence traits both directly and indirectly:
AN OVERVIEW OF MEIOSIS
Meiosis is the production of gametes. Since sexually reproducing organisms need only haploid cells for
reproduction, meiosis is limited to sex cells in special sex organs called gonads. In males, the gonads are the testes,
while in females they are the ovaries. The special cells in these organs—also known as germ cells—produce
haploid cells (n), which then combine to restore the diploid (2n) number during fertilization.
female gamete (n) + male gamete (n) = zygote (2n)
When it comes to genetic variation, meiosis is a big plus. Variation, in fact, is the driving force of evolution. The
