The insulin growth factor (IGF-1) promotes cell
proliferation as shown in the diagram. The expression of
which protein in the diagram is controlled through
negative feedback?
a.
active Cdk4
b.

43. Explain why p53, p21, and CHK2 are considered
tumor suppressor genes, not proto-oncogenes. Give an
example of a proto-oncogene.
a.
p53, p21, and CHK2 suppress the proteins that
regulate the cell cycle, whereas proto-
oncogenes, like phosphorylated Rb, help in cell
cycle progression.
b.
p53, p21, and CHK2 are negative cell cycle
regulators, whereas Cdks are proto-oncogenes,
which could cause cancer when mutated.
c.
p53, p21, and CHK2 suppress the proteins that
regulate the cell cycle, whereas Rb is considered
a proto-oncogene, as it is the most primitive
d.
