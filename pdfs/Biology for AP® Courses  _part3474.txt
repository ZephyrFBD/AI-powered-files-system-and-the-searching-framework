of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied
to the bone. Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many
directions. The epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject to stress from many directions. Imagine laying
a heavy framed picture flat on the floor. You could hold up one side of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was
perpendicular to the floor and the picture. Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture. In
this case, the function of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the picture to the wall. The force on the
picture is straight down to the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of
the hole in the wall pushing up. The toothpick will break off right at the wall.
The neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall. The weight of the b
