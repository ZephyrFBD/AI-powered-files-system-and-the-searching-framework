orry about predators. The consumers of the zooplankton and phytoplankton might also disappear when their food
source disappears and an invasive species can cause trouble throughout the food web.
c. Identify the number of species with no natural predator on this food web.
There are 7 species that have no natural predator (they have no lines pointing away from them).
d. Explain why toxins are more of a concern for tertiary consumers than they are for primary consumers.
Toxins are a concern higher up the food web because they can often become concentrated. For example, it is bad for
a toxin to be absorbed by a plant, but then a fish eats 10 toxin-affected plants and a bigger fish eats 10 of the little
fish, which is like 100 toxin-affected plants. Higher up the food web toxins can concentrate and the animals can begin
to be harmed by the level of toxin even though the primary consumers were not.
