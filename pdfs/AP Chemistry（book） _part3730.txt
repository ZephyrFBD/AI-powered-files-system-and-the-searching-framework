 the low end of the spectrochemical series, so it is a weak-field 
ligand. The CN- ion is on the high end and so is a strong-field ligand, which means it 
produces a larger energy gap ∆ than the F- ion. The splittings of the d-orbital energies in 
these two complexes are compared in Figure 23.32.
Cobalt(III) has an 3Ar43d6 electron configuration, so both complexes in Figure 23.32 
are d 6 complexes. Let’s imagine that we add these six electrons one at a time to the d 
orbitals of the 3CoF643 -  ion. The first three go into the t2 orbitals with their spins par-
allel. The fourth electron could pair up in one of the t2 orbitals. The F- ion is a weak-
field ligand, however, and so the energy gap ∆ between the t2 set and the e set is small. In 
this case, the more stable arrangement is the fourth electron in one of the e orbitals. By 
the same energy argument, the fifth electron goes into the other e orbital. With all five d 
orbitals containing one electron, the sixth must pair up, and th
