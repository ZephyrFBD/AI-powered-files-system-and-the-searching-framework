ort half-lives, meaning that they emit a great deal of 
radiation in a short period of time.
The radiation source used in radiation therapy may be inside or 
outside the body. In almost all cases, radiation therapy uses  gamma 
radiation emitted by radioisotopes. Any alpha or beta radiation that 
is emitted concurrently can be blocked by appropriate packaging. For 
example, 192Ir is often administered as “seeds” consisting of a core of 
radioactive isotope coated with 0.1 mm of platinum metal. The plat-
inum coating stops the alpha and beta rays, but the gamma rays pen-
etrate it readily. The radioactive seeds can be surgically implanted in 
a tumor.
In some cases, human physiology allows a radioisotope to be 
ingested. For example, most of the iodine in the human body ends 
up in the thyroid gland, so thyroid cancer can be treated by using 
large doses of 131I. Radiation therapy on deep organs, where a surgical 
implant is impractical, often uses a 60Co “gun” outside the body to
