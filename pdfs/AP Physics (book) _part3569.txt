momentum (Section 20–4). Their energy is determined in
“calorimeters” utilizing plastic, liquid, or dense metal compound crystal scintillators
(Section 30–13).
In the planning stage is the International Linear Collider (ILC) which would
have colliding beams of 
and 
at around 0.3 to 1 TeV. It would utilize semicon-
ductor detectors using CMOS (Section 25–1) with embedded transistors to allow
fast readout.
Protons at relativistic speeds. Determine the energy
required to accelerate a proton in a high-energy accelerator (a) from rest to
and (b) from 
to 
(c) What is the kinetic
energy achieved by the proton in each case?
APPROACH We use the work-energy principle, which is still valid relativistically
as mentioned in Section 26–9:
SOLUTION The kinetic energy of a proton of mass m is given by Eq. 26–5,
where the relativistic factor is
The work-energy theorem becomes
where 
and 
are for the initial and final speeds,
