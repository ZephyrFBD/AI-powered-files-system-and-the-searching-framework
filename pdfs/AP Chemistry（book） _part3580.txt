This reaction occurs when surface waters move underground through limestone deposits. 
It is the principal way Ca2 + enters groundwater, producing hard water, (water with a high 
mineral content, containing especially Ca2 +  and Mg2 +  ions). If the limestone deposit is 
deep enough underground, dissolution of the limestone produces a cave.
One of the most important reactions of CaCO3 is its decomposition into CaO and 
CO2 at elevated temperatures (Equation 22.56). Because calcium oxide, known as lime 
or quicklime, reacts with water to form Ca1OH22, it is an important commercial base. 
It is also important in making mortar, the mixture of sand, water, and CaO used to

bind bricks, blocks, or rocks together. Calcium oxide reacts with water and CO2 to form 
CaCO3, which binds the sand in the mortar:
