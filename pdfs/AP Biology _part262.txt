MONOHYBRID CROSS
The monohybrid cross (Tt Ã— Tt) is a cross between two organisms that are
each hybrid for one trait. The phenotype (appearance) ratio from this cross
is 3 tall (shaded) to 1 dwarf plant (unshaded). The genotype (type of
genes) ratio, 1:2:1, is given as percentages: 25 percent homozygous
dominant, 50 percent heterozygous, and 25 percent homozygous recessive.
These results are always the same for any monohybrid cross.
BACKCROSS OR TESTCROSS
The testcross or backcross is a way to determine the genotype of an
individual plant or animal showing only the dominant trait. It involves a
cross between real organisms. The individual in question (B___) is crossed

with a homozygous recessive individual (bb). If the individual being tested
is in fact homozygous dominant, all offspring of the testcross will be Bb
and will show the dominant trait. There can be no offspring showing the
recessive tra
