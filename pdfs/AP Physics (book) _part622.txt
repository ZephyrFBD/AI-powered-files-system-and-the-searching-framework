energy. We must be careful, however: gravity acts throughout the fall 
(Fig. 6–23), whereas the elastic force does not act until the ball touches the spring
(Fig. 6–23b). We choose y positive upward, and
at the end of the spring in
its natural (uncompressed) state.
SOLUTION We divide this solution into two parts. (An alternate solution follows.)
Part 1: Let us first consider the energy changes as the ball falls from a height
Fig.6–23a, to
just as it touches the spring, Fig.6–23b.
Our system is the ball acted on by gravity plus the spring (which up to this point
doesn’t do anything). Thus
We solve for
This is the speed of the ball just as it touches the top of the spring, Fig. 6–23b.
Part 2: As the ball compresses the spring, Figs. 6–23b to c, there are two conser-
vative forces on the ball—gravity and the spring force. So our conservation of
energy equation is
Substituting  
(the ball comes to rest for an
instant), and  
we have
We know m,
and Y, so we can solve for k:
