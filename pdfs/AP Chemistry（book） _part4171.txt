 for example, one can’t play a note 
between B and C on a piano. In this analogy, a violin is continu-
ous—in principle, one can play any note (such as a note halfway 
between B and C).  page 218 (a) Electrons will be ejected. If pho-
tons of red light have sufficient energy to eject electrons, then pho-
tons of green light, which have a higher frequency and hence energy 
than red light, will also be able to eject electrons.  page 218 Wave-
like behavior.  page 221 The energies in the Bohr model have only 
certain specific allowed values, much like the positions on the steps 
in Figure 6.6.  page 221 As the potential energy of the electron 
decreases (becomes more negative) it's attraction to the nucleus 
increases and the radius of its orbit decreases.  page 222 ∆E is 
negative for an emission. The negative sign yields a positive number 
that corresponds to the energy of the emitted photon.  page 223 
True. The energy of the emitted photon increases as the initial value 
of n increase
