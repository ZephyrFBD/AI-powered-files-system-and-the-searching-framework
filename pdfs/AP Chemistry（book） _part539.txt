the light bulb. This is experimental evidence that Na+ and Cl- ions are formed 
in aqueous solution.
A substance (such as NaCl) whose aqueous solutions contain ions is called an 
electrolyte. A substance (such as C12H22O112 that does not form ions in solution is 
called a nonelectrolyte. The different classifications of NaCl and C12H22O11 arise 
largely because NaCl is an ionic compound, whereas C12H22O11 is a molecular compound.
how Compounds dissolve in Water
Recall from Figure 2.19 that solid NaCl consists of an orderly arrangement of Na+ and Cl- 
ions. When NaCl dissolves in water, each ion separates from the solid structure and disperses 
throughout the solution [Figure 4.3(a)]. The ionic solid dissociates into its component 
ions as it dissolves.
Water is a very effective solvent for ionic compounds. 
Although H2O is an electrically neutral molecule, the O atom is 
rich in electrons and has a partial negative charge, while each H 
atom has a partial positive charge. The lowercase
