that nucleosynthesis stopped, not to start again for millions of years (in stars).

Thus, after the first quarter hour or so of the universe, matter consisted mainly of
bare nuclei of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 25%)â€  as well as electrons.
But radiation (photons) continued to dominate.
Our story is almost complete. The next important event is thought to have
occurred 380,000 years later. The universe had expanded to about 
of its pres-
ent scale, and the temperature had cooled to about 3000 K. The average kinetic
energy of nuclei, electrons, and photons was less than an electron volt. Since
ionization energies of atoms are on the order of eV, then as the temperature
dropped below this point, electrons could orbit the bare nuclei and remain there
(without being ejected by collisions), thus forming atoms. This period is often
called the recombination epoch (a misnomer since electrons had never before
been combined with nuclei to form atoms). With the disappe
