ncentration of OH- is required to dis-
solve 0.015 mol of Zn1OH22 in a liter of solution?
 17.109  The value of Ksp for Cd1OH22 is 2.5 * 10-14. (a) What 
is the molar solubility of Cd1OH22? (b) The solubility 
of Cd1OH22 can be increased through formation of the 
complex ion CdBr4
2 - 1Kf = 5 * 1032. If solid Cd1OH22 is 
added to a NaBr solution, what is the initial concentration 
of NaBr needed to increase the molar solubility of Cd1OH22 
to 1.0 * 10-3 mol/L?
