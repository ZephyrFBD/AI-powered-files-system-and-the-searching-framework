m. Oxygen, with a greater
electronegativity, exerts a stronger pull on the shared electrons than does each hydrogen atom. This unequal
distribution of electrons creates a negative pole near the oxygen atom and positive poles near each hydrogen atom
(Figure 2-1).
Single covalent, double covalent , and triple covalent bonds form when two, four, and six electrons are shared,
respectively.
3. Hydrogen bonds are weak bonds between molecules. They form when a positively charged hydrogen atom in one
covalently bonded molecule is attracted to a negatively charged area of another covalently bonded molecule. In
water, the positive pole around a hydrogen atom forms a hydrogen bond to the negative pole around the oxygen
atom of another water molecule (Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1
When you think of chemical bonds, imagine a continuum based on the differences of electronegativities (Figure 2-
2). The left end represents bonds that form when no differences exist in the electronegativities of the atoms.
