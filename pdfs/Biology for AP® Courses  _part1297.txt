= (1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12 (Table 12.3). Notice the word “and” in the description of the probability. The “and” is a
signal to apply the product rule. For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability
of having both dominant traits in the F2 progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each
characteristic, as shown here:
3
4 × 3
4 =  9

On the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come
about by more than one pathway. The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event,
of two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word “or” in the description of the
probability. The “or” indicates that you should apply the sum rule. In this case, let’s imagine you are flipping a penny (P)
and a quarter (Q). What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming
