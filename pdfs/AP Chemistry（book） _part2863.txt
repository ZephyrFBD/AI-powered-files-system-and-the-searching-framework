specific 
wavelengths of light. “Flux,” the unit on the vertical axis, is light energy per area per unit of time.
What is the maximum wavelength of light, in nanometers, that has enough energy per photon to dissociate the O2 molecule?
Solve
The dissociation energy of O2 is 495 kJ>mol. Using this value 
and Avogadro’s number, we can calculate the amount of en-
ergy needed to break the bond in a single O2 molecule:
Analyze We are asked to determine the wavelength of a  
photon that has just enough energy to break the O “O double 
bond in O2.
Plan We first need to calculate the energy required to break the 
O “O double bond in one molecule and then find the wave-
length of a photon of this energy.
