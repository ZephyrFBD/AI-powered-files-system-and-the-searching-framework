PROBABILITY
You already saw an introduction to probability calculations in Chapter 8 of this book. The probability (P) that an
event will occur is the number of favorable cases (a) divided by the total number of possible cases (n).
This can be determined experimentally by observation (such as when population data is being collected) or by the
nature of the event. For example, the probability of getting a two when rolling a die is 1/6, since there are six sides
on a die.
Example: What is the probability of drawing the nine of hearts from a deck of cards?
Solution: Since there are 52 cards in a deck and this question is asking about one particular card, P = 1/52.
Combining Probabilities
Many genetics problems involve several probabilities, all being considered together to answer a larger biological
question. There are three rules that are often used.
