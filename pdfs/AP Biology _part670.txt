Tracheal tubes are found in
earthworms
hydra
fish
insects
Breathing in humans is usually regulated by
the number of red blood cells
the amount of hemoglobin in the blood
inherent genetic control
CO2 levels and pH sensors
All of the following descriptions about the normal direction of the
flow of blood are correct EXCEPT
lungs → pulmonary artery
right ventricle → tricuspid valve
aorta → aortic semilunar valve
vena cava → right atrium
The pacemaker of the heart is
the sinoatrial node
the atrioventricular node
the diastolic node
the semilunar node
The Bohr effect on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is
produced directly by c
