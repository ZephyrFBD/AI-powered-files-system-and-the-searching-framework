One isomer has CN in an axial position and the other has it in an 
equatorial position.

(b) These complexes are colored because the crystal-ﬁeld splitting 
energy, ∆, is in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Visible light with l = hc>∆ is absorbed by the complex, promoting 
one of the d-electrons into a higher-energy d-orbital. The remaining 
wavelengths are reﬂected or transmitted; the combination of these 
wavelengths is the color we see. (c) 3V1H2O2643 + will absorb light with 
higher energy because it has a larger ∆ than 3VF643 -. H2O is in the 
middle of the spectrochemical series and causes a larger ∆ than F-, a 
weak-ﬁeld ligand. 23.82 3Co1NH32643 +, yellow; 3Co1H2O2642 +, pink;
