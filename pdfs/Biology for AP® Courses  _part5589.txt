 BBC promoted the 100
genders narrative. The very idea may be the most monumental
nonsense, but it is not what is true that counts, only what you can
make people believe is true. Once the gender of 2 + 2 = 4 has been
dismantled through indoctrination, intimidation and 2 + 2 = 5 then
the new no-gender normal can take its place with Human 2.0.
Aldous Huxley revealed the plan in his prophetic Brave New World in
1932:
Natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created, decanted’, and
raised in ‘hatcheries and conditioning centres’. From birth, people are genetically designed to
fit into one of five castes, which are further split into ‘Plus’ and ‘Minus’ members and designed
to fulfil predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the World State.
How could Huxley know this in 1932? For the same reason George
Orwell knew about the Big Brother state in 1948, Cult insiders I have
quoted knew about it in 1969, and I have known about it since the
early 1990s
