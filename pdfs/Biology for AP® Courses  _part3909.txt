 harm human cells.
c.
Neutrophils are phagocytic and are the first responders to infection. They produce large quantities of
cytokines, which cause pathogen destruction and removal from the body.
d.
Neutrophils produce cytokines that help phagocytes to recognize foreign material that will destroy and
remove pathogens from the body.
Natural Killer Cells
Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large, darkly staining nuclei; they are small cells
with very little cytoplasm, as shown in Figure 33.6. Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer (NK) cells,
lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells (abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade
other tissue). T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes. T cells are lymphocytes
that mature in the thymus gland, and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow. NK cells identify intracellular
infections, especial
