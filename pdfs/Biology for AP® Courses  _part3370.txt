 pituitary—which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. The posterior lobe of the
pituitary gland contains axons of the hypothalamic neurons.

Anterior Pituitary
The anterior pituitary gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the
hypothalamus, down along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. This capillary network is a part of the
hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the
anterior pituitary into the circulatory system. A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore,
the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pit
