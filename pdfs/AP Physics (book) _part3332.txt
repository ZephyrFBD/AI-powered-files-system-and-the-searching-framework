To specify a given nuclide, we need give only A and Z. A special symbol is
commonly used which takes the form
where X is the chemical symbol for the element (see Appendix B, and the Periodic
Table inside the back cover), A is the atomic mass number, and Z is the atomic
number. For example,
means a nitrogen nucleus containing 7 protons and 
8 neutrons for a total of 15 nucleons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons
orbiting the nucleus is equal to the atomic number Z (since the charge on an
electron has the same magnitude but opposite sign to that of a proton). The main
properties of an atom, and how it interacts with other atoms, are largely deter-
mined by the number of electrons. Hence Z determines what kind of atom it is:
carbon, oxygen, gold, or whatever. It is redundant to specify both the symbol of 
a nucleus and its atomic number Z as described above. If the nucleus is nitrogen,
for example, we know immediately that
