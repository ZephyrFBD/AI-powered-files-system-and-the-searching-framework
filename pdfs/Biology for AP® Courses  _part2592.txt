stunting of growth caused
by undernourishment in early infancy that affects millions
of children.
Human growth hormone stimulates the release of insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a messenger that
activates the production of bone cells called osteocytes.
The data (after Schwarzer et al., Science, 2016) show
concentrations of this growth factor in mice with no
microbiome (GF), wild-type mice whose microbiome and
growth provide a control (WT), and mice whose
microbiome population is composed entirely of
Lactobacillus plantarum (two strains labeled L1 and L2).
Lactobacillus is one of many hundred genera of microbial
inhabitants of a healthy human intestine.

disruption of human bone growth due to loss or reduction
in diversity of the microbiome.
