The Light-Independent Reactions
Now let’s turn to the dark side. The dark reactions use the products of the light reactions—ATP and NADPH—to
make sugar. We now have energy to make glucose, but what do plants use as their carbon source? CO2, of course.
You’ve probably heard of the term carbon fixation. All this means is that CO2 from the air is converted into
carbohydrates. This step occurs in the stroma of the leaf. The dark reactions are also called the Calvin-Benson
Cycle (or just Calvin cycle).
Let’s summarize important facts about the dark reactions:
The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts.
ATP and NADPH from the light reactions are necessary for carbon fixation.
CO2 is fixed to form glucose.
