 that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the 
 
 room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma 
 
 mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head 
 
 on the table and fell asleep. 
 
 Dad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care 
 
 of your little brothers. 
 
 Mam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying 
 
 sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I’ll go 
 
 down to Thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. 
 
 The St.Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows. 
 
 She goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating 
 
 on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och. 
 
 Dad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me 
 
 with her small bird sounds and I don’t know what to do though I wonder 
 
 if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and 
 
 bread because it’s a long time sin
