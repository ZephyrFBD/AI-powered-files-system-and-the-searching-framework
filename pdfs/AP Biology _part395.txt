in 
extreme
environments, like
METHANOGENS—obtain energy in a unique way by producing
methane from hydrogen
HALOPHILES—thrive in environments with high salt
concentrations like Utah’s Great Salt Lake
THERMOPHILES—thrive in very high temperatures, like in the
hot springs in Yellowstone Park or in deep-sea hydrothermal
