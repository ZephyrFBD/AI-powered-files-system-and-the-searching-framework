ption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the
environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the
first crop plants to be genetically engineered.

Transformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases act by
incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens
occur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants
stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets,
are affected by A. tumefaciens. The artificial intro
