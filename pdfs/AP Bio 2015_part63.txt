 Thyroxin is a hormone that increases metabolic 
activities within various tissue targets. Low levels 
of circulating thyroxin trigger the secretion of 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the 
anterior pituitary. TSH secretion then stimulates 
thyroxin production and release by the thyroid 
gland. The increased level of circulating thyroxin 
inhibits further secretion of TSH from the anterior 
pituitary. 
Based on the information provided, which of the 
following can most likely be concluded about the 
TSH-thyroxin loop? 
(A) A person taking thyroxin to supplement low 
thyroxin secretion will produce more TSH. 
(B) Increased thyroxin production would cause
