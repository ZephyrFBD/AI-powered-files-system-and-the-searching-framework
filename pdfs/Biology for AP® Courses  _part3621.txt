where it is unloaded,
and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be expelled from the body. Although gas exchange is a
continuous process, the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different mechanisms.
Transport of Oxygen in the Blood
Although oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way. Only 1.5 percent of oxygen in
the blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself. Most oxygen—98.5 percent—is bound to a protein called hemoglobin
and carried to the tissues.
Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits
and two beta subunits (Figure 30.19). Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen
molecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. Molecules with more oxygen bound to the
heme groups are brighter red. As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carryi
