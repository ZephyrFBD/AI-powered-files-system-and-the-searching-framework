In this chapter, our first goal is to understand the relationship between two- 
dimensional Lewis structures and three-dimensional molecular shapes. We will see the 
intimate relationship between the number of electrons in a molecule and the overall shape 
it adopts. Armed with this knowledge, we can examine more closely the nature of covalent 
bonds. The lines used to depict bonds in Lewis structures provide important clues about the 
orbitals that molecules use in bonding. By examining these orbitals, we can gain a greater 
understanding of the behavior of molecules. Mastering the material in this chapter will 
help you in later discussions of the physical and chemical properties of substances.
In the space-filling model, what determines the relative sizes of the 
spheres?
