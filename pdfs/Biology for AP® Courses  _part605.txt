hrough the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis.
Receptor-mediated Endocytosis
A targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity
for certain substances (Figure 5.22).

Figure 5.22 In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of
substance that binds to the receptor on the external surface of the cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by

In receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.
If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will
not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some
human diseases are caused by the failu
