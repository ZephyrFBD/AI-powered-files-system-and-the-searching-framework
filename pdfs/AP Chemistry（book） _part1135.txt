1). However, these 
ions play an important role in human physiology. Sodium and potas-
sium ions, for example, are major components of blood plasma and 
intracellular ﬂuid, respectively, with average concentrations of 0.1 M. 
 
These electrolytes serve as vital charge carriers in normal cellular 
function. In contrast, the lithium ion has no known function in 
normal human physiology. Since the discovery of lithium in 1817, 
however, people have believed that salts of the element possessed 
almost mystical healing powers. There were even claims that lithium 
ions were an ingredient in ancient “fountain of youth” formulas. In 
1927, C. L. Grigg began marketing a soft drink that contained lithium. 
The original unwieldy name of the beverage was “Bib-Label Lithiated 
Lemon-Lime Soda,” which was soon changed to the simpler and 
more familiar name 7UP® (Figure 7.24).
