reased genetic diversity). Choice (D) is incorrect because
temperature does not affect independent assortment.
2. (B) Hybrid refers to heterozygous genotypes. Choice (A) is the opposite of the correct answer. Choices (C) and
(D) are both incorrect because haploid and diploid are terms that refer to the number of chromosomes in a cell,
not genotypes.
3. (C) If the plant with round peas is heterozygous, its genotype is Rr. The definition of a test cross is to cross an
individual with the dominant phenotype (but an unknown genotype) with a homozygous recessive individual.
Thus, if the Rr plant was crossed with an rr plant, 50% of the offspring would be expected to be round and 50%
would be expected to be wrinkled. Choice (A) is incorrect because it describes the expected results if the
original round plant was homozygous dominant (RR). Choice (B) is incorrect because in order to produce that
proportion of offspring, both parent plants would have to be heterozygous (Rr), but the plant used
