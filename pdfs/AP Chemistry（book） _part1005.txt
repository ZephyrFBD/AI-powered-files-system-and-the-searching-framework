subshell with more than one degenerate orbital, such as the 2p sub-
shell, Hundâ€™s rule states that the lowest energy is attained by max-
imizing the number of electrons with the same electron spin. For 
example, in the ground-state electron configuration of carbon, the 
two 2p electrons have the same spin and must occupy two different 
2p orbitals.
Elements in any given group in the periodic table have the same 
type of electron arrangements in their outermost shells. For example, 
the electron configurations of the halogens fluorine and chlorine are 
3He42s22p5 and 3Ne43s23p5, respectively. The outer-shell electrons are 
those that lie outside the orbitals occupied  in the next lowest noble-
gas element. The outer-shell electrons that are involved in chemical 
bonding are the valence electrons of an atom; for the elements with 
atomic number 30 or less, all of the outer-shell electrons are valence 
electrons. The electrons that are not valence electrons are called core 
electrons.
