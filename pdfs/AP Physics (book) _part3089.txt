a beam of electrons that go
undeflected when passing through crossed (perpendicular)
electric and magnetic fields of magnitude 
and 
respectively? (b) What is the radius of
the electron orbit if the electric field is turned off?

is held at rest
between two large plates separated by 1.0 cm (Fig. 27–3),
when the potential difference between the plates is 340 V.
How many excess electrons does this drop have?
27–2 Blackbodies; Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
4. (I) How hot is a metal being welded if it radiates most
strongly at 520 nm?
5. (I) Estimate the peak wavelength for radiation emitted from
(a) ice at 0°C, (b) a floodlamp at 3100 K, (c) helium at 4 K,
assuming blackbody emission. In what region of the EM
spectrum is each?
6. (I) (a) What is the temperature if the peak of a blackbody
spectrum is at 18.0 nm? (b) What is the wavelength at the
peak of a blackbody spectrum if the body is at a tempera-
ture of 2200 K?
