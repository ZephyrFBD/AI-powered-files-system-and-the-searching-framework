r orbitals make up the conduction band. The valence and 
conduction bands are separated by an energy that is referred to as the 
band gap, Eg. The size of the band gap increases as the bond length 
decreases and as the difference in electronegativity between the two 
elements increases.
Doping semiconductors changes their ability to conduct electric-
ity by orders of magnitude. An n-type semiconductor is one that is 
doped so that there are excess electrons in the conduction band; a 
p-type semiconductor is one that is doped so that there are missing 
electrons, which are called holes, in the valence band.
POLYMERS (SECTION 12.8) Polymers are molecules of high molec-
ular weight formed by joining large numbers of small molecules 
called monomers. Plastics are materials that can be formed into various 
shapes, usually by the application of heat and pressure. Thermoplastic
polymers can be reshaped, typically through heating, in contrast to 
thermosetting plastics, which are formed into o
