nd is therefore flanked by 
carbon atoms. (Section 24.4)
kinetic energy The energy that an object possesses by virtue of 
its motion. (Section 1.4)
kinetic-molecular theory of gases A set of assumptions about 
the nature of gases. These assumptions, when translated into 
mathematical form, yield the ideal-gas equation. (Section 10.7)
lanthanide contraction The gradual decrease in atomic and ionic 
radii with increasing atomic number among the lanthanide 
elements, atomic numbers 57 through 70. The decrease arises 
because of a gradual increase in effective nuclear charge through 
the lanthanide series. (Section 23.1)
lanthanide (rare earth) element Element in which the 4f 
subshell is only partially occupied. (Sections 6.8 and 6.9)
lattice energy The energy required to separate completely the 
ions in an ionic solid into its gaseous ions. (Section 8.2)
lattice points Points in a crystal, all of which have identical 
environments. (Section 12.2)
lattice vectors The vectors a, b, and c t
