 n is always a positive number, the energy of the photon 
1hn2 must always be positive. Thus, the sign of ∆E tells us whether 
the photon is absorbed or emitted:
 
∆E 7 0 1nf 7 ni2: Photon absorbed with Ephoton = hn = ∆E   
 
∆E 6 0 1nf 6 ni2: Photon emitted with Ephoton = hn = -∆E  
[6.7]
These two situations are summarized in Figure 6.13. We see that 
Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom leads to the conclusion that 
only the specific frequencies of light that satisfy Equation 6.7 can be 
absorbed or emitted by the atom.
Let’s see how to apply these concepts by considering a transition in which the 
 
electron moves from ni = 3 to nf = 1. From Equation 6.6 we have
∆E = 1-2.18 * 10 - 18 J2a 1
1
2 - 1
32 b = 1-2.18 * 10 - 18 J2a8
9b = -1.94 * 10 - 18 J
The value of ∆E is negative—that makes sense because the electron is falling from a higher- 
energy orbit 1n = 32 to a lower-energy orbit 1n = 12. A photon is emitted during this transi-
tion, and the energy of the photon is equal to Ephoto
