molecules are often called side chains.) 
 
Table 24.3, for example, shows all the straight-chain and branched-chain alkanes con-
taining four and five carbon atoms.

CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
Compounds that have the same molecular formula but different bonding arrange-
ments (and hence different structures) are called structural isomers. 
 (Section 2.9) 
Thus, C4H10 has two structural isomers and C5H12 has three. The structural isomers of a 
given alkane differ slightly from one another in physical properties, as the melting and 
boiling points in Table 24.3 indicate.
The number of possible structural isomers increases rapidly with the number of 
carbon atoms in the
