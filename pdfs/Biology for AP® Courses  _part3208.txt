 perception of nociception, does not start until
it is communicated to the brain. There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain. Most axons carrying
nociceptive information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and
the neural signal undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, one nociceptive pathway
projects not to the thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and
neuroendocrine functions of the autonomic nervous system. Recall that threatening—or painful—stimuli stimulate the
sympathetic branch of the visceral sensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response.

Select the stimulus that can activate the nociceptive system.
