 of radius 2R has a circular
hole of radius R cut out of it. The center 
of the smaller
circle is a distance 0.80R from
the center C of the larger
circle, Fig. 7–41. What is
the position of the center
of mass of the plate?

Problem 55.
*7;9 CM for the Human Body
*56. (I) Assume that your proportions are the same as those in
Table 7–1, and calculate the mass of one of your legs.
*57. (I) Determine the CM of an outstretched arm using Table 7–1.
*58. (II) Use Table 7–1 to calculate the position of the CM of an arm
bent at a right angle. Assume that the person is 155 cm tall.
*59. (II) When a high jumper is in a position such that his arms
and lower legs are hanging vertically, and his thighs, trunk,
and head are horizontal just above the bar, estimate how far
below the torso’s median line the CM will be. Will this CM be
outside the body? Use Table 7–1.
*60. (III) Repeat Problem 59 assuming the body bends at the
hip joint by about 15°. Estimate, using
