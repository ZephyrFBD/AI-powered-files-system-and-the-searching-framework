consider before 
beginning their investigation. 
•  How are normal cells and cancer cells different from each other? 
•  What are the main causes of cancer? 
•  How can we explain the fact that there so many different cancers, even in   
the same types of cells or tissues?  
•  How is the cell cycle controlled in normal cells? 
•  What are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases? What do these proteins do in a cell?  
•  What goes wrong during the cell cycle in cancer cells? 
•  What makes some genes related to increased cancer risk? 
•  Do you think that the chromosomes might be different between normal   
and cancer cells?

Have your students form groups and ask each group to form a hypothesis as to how the 
chromosomes of a cancer cell might appear in comparison to a normal cell and how 
those differences are related to the behavior of the cancer cell. 
Show your students a picture of cancer cells and ask them what they know about
