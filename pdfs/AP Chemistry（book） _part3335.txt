i) Hydrogen and oxygen 
gases are combusted and used to drive a generator, much 
as coal is currently used in the electric power industry; 
(ii) hydrogen and oxygen gases are used to generate elec-
tricity directly by using fuel cells that operate at 85 °C. 
(a) Use data in Appendix C to calculate ∆H° and ∆S° for 
the reaction. We will assume that these values do not 
change appreciably with temperature. (b) Based on the 
values from part (a), what trend would you expect for 
the magnitude of ∆G for the reaction as the temperature 
increases? (c) What is the significance of the change in 
the magnitude of ∆G with temperature with respect to

the utility of hydrogen as a fuel? (d) Based on the analysis 
here, would it be more efficient to use the combustion 
method or the fuel-cell method to generate electrical 
energy from hydrogen?
