 cells are mixed with “nursemaid” cells called Sertoli cells
which protect the germ cells and promote their development. Other cells mixed in the wall of the tubules are the interstitial
cells of Leydig. These cells produce high levels of testosterone once the male reaches adolescence.
When the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature, they leave the testicles and enter the epididymis, shown in
Figure 34.10. This structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion of the testes; it is the site of
sperm maturation. The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), which carries the sperm,
behind the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. During a vasectomy, a section
of the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing
fertilization.
Semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions (about 10 percent of the total)
