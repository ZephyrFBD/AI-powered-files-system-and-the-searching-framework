 Which of the following biotechnology approaches 
could be used to identify ferritin mRNA in a 
sample of total cellular RNA? 
(A) RNA samples could be directly cloned into a 
DNA plasmid, grown in bacteria, and tested 
for the ability to bind iron. 
(B) RNA samples could be separated by size 
using agarose gel electrophoresis and 
incubated with labeled single-stranded DNA 
molecules that are complementary to the 
ferritin mRNA. 
(C) RNA samples could be converted to protein 
and subsequently cut with a restriction 
endonuclease that recognizes DNA 
sequences. 
(D) RNA samples could be examined under a 
high-power microscope to visually identify 
the ferritin mRNA.
