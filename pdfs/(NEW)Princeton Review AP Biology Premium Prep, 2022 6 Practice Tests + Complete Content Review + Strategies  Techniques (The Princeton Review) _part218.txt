state is sort of a reactants-products hybrid state that is difficult
to achieve. In order to reach this transition state, a certain amount of energy is required. This is called the activation
energy.
Be careful: a transition state is not the same thing as a reaction intermediate.
Transition states occur in each step of every reaction, between the reactant(s)
and the product(s). Intermediates are formed between each step of a multistep
reaction.
You’ll notice that we needed a little energy to get us going. That’s because chemical bonds must be broken before
new bonds can form. This energy barrier—the hump in the graph—is called the activation energy. Once a set of
reactants has reached its activation energy, the rest of the reaction is all downhill. Reaching the transition state is the
tough part.
ENZYMES
A catalyst is something that speeds something up. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up reactions. They
accomplish this by lowering the activation energy and helping the trans
