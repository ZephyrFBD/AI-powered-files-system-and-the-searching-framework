ts genetic variation be
affected over time? Could speciation occur in this
situation? Explain your ideas.
a.
Genetic variation would increase and speciation
would be possible
b.
Genetic variation would increase and speciation
would not be possible.
c.
Genetic variation would decrease and speciation
would be possible.
d.
Genetic variation would decrease and speciation
would not be possible.
35. What role do prezygotic and postzygotic barriers play
in speciation?
a.
Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers allow for the
formation of less-fit hybrids that reinforces
speciation.
b.
Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers prevent
interbreeding of species such that there is no
gene flow between them.
c.
Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers prevent
migration of the two species, causing them to
remain in contact with each other and begin to
interbreed.
d.
Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers are present
only in newly-formed species, allowing
scientists to identify the time of divergence of
the species.
