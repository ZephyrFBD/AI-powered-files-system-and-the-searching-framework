- charge. Show and label each vector force or field
on your diagram.
2. Apply Coulomb’s law to calculate the magnitude of
the force that each contributing charge exerts on a
charged object, or the magnitude of the electric field
each charge produces at a given point. Deal only with
magnitudes of charges (leaving out minus signs), and
obtain the magnitude of each force or electric field.
3. Add vectorially all the forces on an object, or the
contributing fields at a point, to get the resultant. Use
symmetry (say, in the geometry) whenever possible.

Electric Fields
Whether you use electric field or electrostatic forces, the
procedure for solving electrostatics problems is similar:
1. Draw a careful diagram—namely, a free-body dia-
