oton
energy is less than the work function, no electrons are ejected.
NOTE In (a) we used the nonrelativistic equation for kinetic energy. If v had
turned out to be more than about 0.1c, our calculation would have been inaccurate
by more than a percent or so, and we would probably prefer to redo it using the
relativistic form (Eq. 26–5).
EXERCISE C Determine the lowest frequency and the longest wavelength needed to
emit electrons from sodium.
By converting units, we can show that the energy of a photon in electron
volts, when given the wavelength in nm, is
[photon energy in eV]
Applications of the Photoelectric Effect
The photoelectric effect, besides playing an important historical role in confirm-
ing the photon theory of light, also has many practical applications. Burglar alarms
and automatic doors often make use of the photocell circuit of Fig. 27–6. When 
a person interrupts the beam of light, the sudden drop in current in the circuit
activates a switch—often a solenoid—which ope
