B. The two chromosomes are homologous.
C. All gametes would be either AB or ab.
D. The genotype of this individual is AaBb.

Questions 17-19 refer to the following pedigree. Circles indicate females, and squares indicate males. A horizontal
line connecting a male and female indicates that these two individuals produced offspring. Offspring are indicated
by a descending vertical line that branches to the offspring. A filled circle or filled square indicates that the
individual has a particular trait, in this case, red-green color blindness. Color blindness is inhe
