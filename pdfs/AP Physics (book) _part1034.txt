10–5 Pascal’s Principle
The Earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure on all objects with which it is in con-
tact, including other fluids. External pressure acting on a fluid is transmitted
throughout that fluid. For instance, according to Eq. 10–3a, the pressure due to
the water at a depth of 100 m below the surface of a lake is 
or 9.7 atm. However, the
total pressure at this point is due to the pressure of water plus the pressure of 
the air above it. Hence the total pressure (if the lake is near sea level) is
This is just one example of a general principle
attributed to the French philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662).
Pascal’s principle states that if an external pressure is applied to a confined fluid,
the pressure at every point within the fluid increases by that amount.
A number of practical devices make use of Pascal’s principle. One examp
