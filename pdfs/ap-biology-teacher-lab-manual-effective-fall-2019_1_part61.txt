s The student is able to analyze 
data to identify possible patterns and relationships between a biotic or abiotic factor 
and a biological system (2D1 and 5.1). The student might be asked to complete a 
data grid of choice for fruit flies, analyze the data, and draw conclusions. Table 1 is 
an example of a data table that students could construct for themselves as they use 
the choice chamber (x = number of flies at one of the two ends of the chamber). The 
students may need to adjust the table to indicate multiple trials.
