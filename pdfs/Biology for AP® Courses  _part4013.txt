t mouse. The
mouse embryo cell does not make antibodies, yet its DNA
contains nucleotide sequences encoding antibody
polypeptides. The adult mouse B cell makes and secretes a
single type of antibody. In the experiment, radiolabeled
DNA probes were synthesized to be complementary to the
DNA encoding the light chains of antibody produced by
the adult mouse B cells. Then, DNA from the mouse
embryo cell and from the adult B cell were isolated and
tested to see if either hybridized with the synthesized
radiolabeled DNA probes. The results are shown in the

diagram. Which claim is best supported by the data?
a.
The mouse genome contains an enormous
number of antibody genes, which accounts for
the huge diversity of antibody molecules that
can be made.
b.
Rearrangement of gene segments encoding
antibody polypeptides occurs at the level of
DNA to produce an enormous diversity of
an
