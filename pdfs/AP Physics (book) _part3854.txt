stant volume, no work is done, so the first
law of thermodynamics tells us that
For an ideal monatomic gas, the internal energy, U, is the total kinetic energy of
all the molecules,
as we saw in Section 14–2. Then, using Eq. D–1a, we write
as
(D;3)
or
(D;4)
Since 
kinetic theory predicts that
for an ideal monatomic gas. This is very close to the exper-
imental values for monatomic gases such as helium and neon (Table D–1). From
Eq.D–2,
is predicted to be 
also in agreement with experiment (Table D–1).
Equipartition of Energy
The measured molar specific heats for more complex gases (Table D–1), such as
diatomic (two atoms) and triatomic (three atoms) gases, increase with the increased
number of atoms per molecule. We can explain this by assuming that the internal
energy includes not only translational kinetic energy but other forms of energy as
well. For example, in a diatomic gas (Fig. D–1), the two atoms can rotate about
two different axes (but rotation about a third axis passing thro
