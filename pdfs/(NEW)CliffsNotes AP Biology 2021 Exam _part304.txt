syndrome is caused by the nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes. The result is a sperm or egg that is
missing a sex chromosome. The formation of a zygote from the union of one of these sperm or eggs with a normal
egg or sperm (with an X chromosome) results in Turner syndrome (XO). It is also possible to form an OY zygote,
but because this zygote is missing an X chromosome, a chromosome with many essential genes, the zygote is
nonviable. Answer choice C, Down syndrome, is also caused by nondisjunction, but of chromosome 21, not the sex
chromosomes. Sickle-cell disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive allele, while hemophilia is inherited as a
sex-linked recessive allele.
23. D. Since the genes A and B are on the same chromosome (linked), there are two possible allele arrangements for
an AaBb individual. The first is that AB is on one chromosome and ab is on the homologous chromosome. The
second possibility is that Ab is on one chromosome and aB is on the homologous chromosome. Usi
