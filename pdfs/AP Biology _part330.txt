diation. A mutation in somatic (body)
cells disrupts normal cell functions. Mutations that occur in gametes are
transmitted to offspring and can change the gene pool of a population.
Mutations are the raw material for natural selection.
Some regions of DNA are more vulnerable to mutations than others.
For example, regions of As and Ts are subject to more breakages than
regions of Cs and Gs because A and T are connected by a double hydrogen
bond whereas Cs and Gs are more strongly connected by a triple hydrogen
bond.
Point Mutation
The simplest mutation is a point mutation. This is a base-pair
substitution, a chemical change in just one base pair in a single gene.
Here is an example of a change in an English sentence analogous to a point
mutation in DNA:
Point Mutation

The processing of genetic information is imperfect and causes mutations that are a
source of genetic variation.
