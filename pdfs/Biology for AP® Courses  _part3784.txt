ter. Solutions
on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water
across the membrane. As seen in Figure 32.2, a cell placed in water tends to swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic
or “low salt” environment. A cell placed in a solution with higher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make
the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water into the hypertonic or “high salt” environment. Isotonic cells have an equal
concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane
which is a semi-permeable membrane.
Figure 32.2 Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water. In a hypotonic environment,
cells tend to swell due to intake of water. The blood maintains an isotonic environment so that cells neither shrink nor
swell. (credit: Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
