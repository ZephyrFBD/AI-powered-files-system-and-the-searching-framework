of the bullet. The minus sign indicates that the velocity (and momentum) of the
rifle is in the negative x direction, opposite to that of the bullet.

7–3 Collisions and Impulse
Collisions are a common occurrence in everyday life: a tennis racket or a baseball
bat striking a ball, billiard balls colliding, a hammer hitting a nail. When a collision
occurs, the interaction between the objects involved is usually far
