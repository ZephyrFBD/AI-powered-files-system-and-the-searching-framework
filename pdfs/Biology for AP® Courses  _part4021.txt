sider the following:
•
Macrophages and phagocytes share information with
the adaptive immune system by displaying protein
fragments of their targets on their surfaces to
communicate with T cells.
•
The onset of autoimmune disease often follows an
infection.
•
After an infection has passed, tissue must be repaired,
and macrophages and phagocytes remain active in the
affected tissue, often leading to chronic
inflammation.
•
Type 2 diabetes, traditionally categorized as a
metabolic disease, begins as chronic inflammation
and is now classified as an autoimmune disease by
many scientists.
•
Autophagy is induced by stresses such as starvation.
B. Evaluate the strength of the question, do cell
fragments produced by the innate immune response during
inflammation communicate self as non-self to T cells

leading to autoimmunity?
In the “fight or flight” response, neural signals are sent to
the adrenal gland activating the release of epinephrine.
