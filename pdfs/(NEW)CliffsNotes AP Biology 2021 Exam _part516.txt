ss the membrane reestablishes the resting potential, a graded potential is a local event, with the
magnitude of the stimulus decaying as the stimulus flows along the neuron.

2. Depolarization and action potentials. In response to a stimulus, voltage-gated ion channels in the membrane
suddenly open and permit the Na+on the outside to rush into the cell. As the positively charged
 
Na+ rush in, the charge on the cell membrane becomes depolarized
 
(from −70 toward 0 millivolts). If the stimulus is strong enough—that is, if it is above a certain threshold level—
more Na+ gates open,
 
increasing the inflow of Na+ even more, causing an action potential, or
 
complete depolarization (reversing polarity to about +30 millivolts).
Once this action potential is attained, the Na+ channels become inactivated (Na+ flow stops and the channel cannot
respond to new stimuli), but neighboring Na+ channels are activated. In a
positivefeedback fashion, the action potential travels down the le
