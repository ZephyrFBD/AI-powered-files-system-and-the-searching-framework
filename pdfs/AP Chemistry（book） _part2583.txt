on, we must calculate the number of moles of NaClO needed to 
increase the pH of 2.00 L of water to 10.50.
SOLUTION
Plan From the pH, we can determine the equilibrium concentra-
tion of OH-. We can then construct a table of initial and equilib-
rium concentrations in which the initial concentration of ClO- is 
our unknown. We can calculate 3ClO-4 using the expression for Kb.
16.8 ∣ Relationship Between Ka and Kb
We have seen in a qualitative way that the stronger an acid, the weaker its conjugate base. 
Let us be more quantitative and consider the NH4
+ and NH3 conjugate acid–base pair. 
Each species reacts with water. For the acid, NH4
+, the equilibrium is
 
NH4
+1aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH31aq2 + H3O+1aq2 
or written in its simpler form:
 
NH4
+1aq2 ∆ NH31aq2 + H+1aq2 
[16.38]
For the base, NH3, the equilibrium is
 
NH31aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH4
+1aq2 + OH-1aq2 
[16.39]
Each equilibrium is expressed by a dissociation constant:
 
Ka =
3NH343H+4
