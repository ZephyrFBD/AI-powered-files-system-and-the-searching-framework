Animals also exhibit behavioral rhythms in response to the changes in seasons. With the changing seasons come
changes in weather (temperature, precipitation), changes in the length of day and night, and changes in the
availability of food. To maximize fitness (survival and reproduction), animals adjust their behavior to take
advantage of the benefits or protect themselves from the challenges that each season brings.
Hibernation is a behavior characterized by an extended period of sleep, dormancy, or other torpid state to avoid the
hostile environment that comes with winter. In addition to cold and inclement weather, food is scarce because
annual plants die and other plants drop their leaves or slow their growth. Animals that are hibernating reduce energy
use by lowering their body temperatures and minimizing metabolic maintenance activities, drawing upon energy
reserves such as fat or briefly awakening to eat stored food. Some animals, such as bears, bats, and hummingbirds,
