l and Si are in the same period, with Si to the right of Al.
radius Si 6 radius Al
The radius increases as we move down a group with Al and B 
belonging to the same group, as do C and Si.
radius B 6 radius Al
radius C 6 radius Si
Combining these comparisons, we can conclude that C has the 
smallest radius and Al the largest. Unfortunately, the two periodic 
trends available to us do not supply enough information to deter-
mine the relative sizes of B and Si.
radius C 6 radius B ∼radius Si 6 radius Al
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
By referring to the periodic table, but not to Figure 7.7, place 
the following atoms in order of increasing bonding atomic 
radius: N, O, P
, Ge.
(a) N 6 O 6 P 6 Ge 
(b) P 6 N 6 O 6 Ge
(c) O 6 N 6 Ge 6 P
(d) O 6 N 6 P 6 Ge
(e) N 6 P 6 Ge 6 O
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Arrange Be, C, K, and Ca in order of increasing atomic radius.
Check Referring back to Figure 7.7, we can obtain numerical values 
for each atomic radius that allow us to say that the radius of Si is
