Fibrous root systems are found in monocots and
tap root systems are found in dicots.
b.
A fibrous root system, such as that of a carrot,
has a single main root that grows down. A
taproot system, such as that of wheat, forms a
dense network of roots that is closer to the soil
surface. Fibrous root systems are found in
monocots and tap root systems are found in
dicots.

A taproot system, such as that of rice, has a
single main root that grows down. A fibrous root
system, such as that of a carrot, forms a dense
network of roots that is closer to the soil surface.
Fibrous root systems are found in monocots and
tap root systems are found in dicots.
