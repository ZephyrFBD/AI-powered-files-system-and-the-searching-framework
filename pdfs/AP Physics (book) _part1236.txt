FM often cannot. That is, AM signals bend more than FM.
Explain. (Radio signals, as we shall see, are carried by elec-
tromagnetic waves whose wavelength for AM is typically
200 to 600 m and for FM about 3 m.)

Oscillations and Waves
13. What happens when two waves, such as waves on a lake,
come from different directions and run into each other?
(a) They cancel each other out and disappear.
(b) If they are the same size, they cancel each other out
and disappear. If one wave is larger than the other, the
smaller one disappears and the larger one shrinks but
continues.
(c) They get larger where they run into each other; then
they continue in a direction between the direction of
the two original waves and larger than either original
wave.
(d) They may have various patterns where they overlap,
but each wave cont
