ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.I.1
Organisms capture and store energy for use in 
biological processes—
a.  
Photosynthesis captures energy from the 
sun and produces sugars.
 i. 	

	
	

	
Prokaryotic photosynthetic pathways 
were the foundation of eukaryotic 
photosynthesis. 
ENE-1.I.2
The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis 
in eukaryotes involve a series of coordinated 
reaction pathways that capture energy present 
in light to yield ATP and NADPH, which power the 
production of organic molecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.I
Describe the photosynthetic 
processes that allow 
organisms to capture and 
store energy.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-1
The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
SUGGESTED SKILL
Argumentation
6.B 
Support a claim with 
evidence from biological 
principles, concepts, 
processes, and/or data.
