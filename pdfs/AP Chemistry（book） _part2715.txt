 acid–base titration, a solution containing a known concentration of base is 
slowly added to an acid (or the acid is added to the base).

indicators can be used to signal the equivalence point of a titration (the point at which 
stoichiometrically equivalent quantities of acid and base have been brought together). 
Alternatively, a pH meter can be used to monitor the progress of the reaction 
(Figure 17.6), producing a pH titration curve, a graph of the pH as a function of the 
volume of titrant added. The shape of the titration curve makes it possible to deter-
mine the equivalence point. The curve can also be used to select suitable indicators 
and to determine the Ka of the weak acid or the Kb of the weak base being titrated.
To understand why titration curves have certain characteristic shapes, we will 
examine the curves for three kinds of titrations: (1) strong acid–strong base, (2) weak 
acid–str
