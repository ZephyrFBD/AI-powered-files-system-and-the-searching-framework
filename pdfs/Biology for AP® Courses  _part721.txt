mine which reactions will proceed and at which rates. This determination is tightly controlled. In certain cellular
environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors, like pH and temperature. There are other
mechanisms through which cells control the activity of enzymes and determine the rates at which various biochemical
reactions will occur.
Regulation of Enzymes by Molecules
Enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity. There are many different kinds of molecules
that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms exist for doing so. In some cases of enzyme inhibition,
for example, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the
substrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition, because an inhibitor
molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding (Figure 6.17). On the other hand, in noncomp
