transpiration occurs. Hydrostatic receptors in the guard cells
trigger the plant to bend in the direction of the most intense
light.
(D)
8. Which of the following models would explain the mechanism by
which the plants bended toward the blue light?
Cells detecting the blue light transmit cell-lengthening signals
to the cells directly below them. These cells directly below
expand, and the stem bends toward the light.
(A)
Cells detecting the blue light transmit cell-lengthening signals
laterally while inhibiting cell lengthening locally. This causes
cells stimulated by the least light to elongate, bending the
plant toward the blue light.
(B)
Cells detecting the blue light transmit cell-lengthening signals
locally while inhibiting cell lengthening laterally. This causes
cells stimulated by the most light to elongate, bending the
plant toward the blue light.
(C)
Blue light causes more photosynthesis in the cells on the side
of the plant closest to the light. The increased sugar causes
thes
