asured across the slab’s width.
The probe is then placed in a magnetic field of unknown
magnitude B, and a Hall emf of 63 mV is measured.
Determine B assuming that the angle 
between the
unknown field and the plane of the slab’s rectangular face
is (a) 
and (b)
*23. (III) The Hall effect can be used to measure blood flow rate
because the blood contains ions that constitute an electric
current. (a) Does the sign of the ions influence the emf?
Explain. (b) Determine the flow velocity in an artery 3.3 mm
in diameter if the measured emf across the width of the
artery is 0.13 mV and B is 0.070 T. (In actual practice, an
alternating magnetic field is used.)
*24. (III) A long copper strip 1.8 cm wide and 1.0 mm thick is
placed in a 1.2-T magnetic field as in Fig. 20–21a. When a
steady current of 15 A passes through it, the Hall emf is
measured to be 
Determine (a) the drift velocity of
the electrons and (b) the density of free (conducting) elec-
trons (number per unit volume) in the copper. [
