Frequencies and wavelengths in the violin. A 0.32-m-long
violin string is tuned to play A above middle C at 440 Hz. (a) What is the wave-
length of the fundamental string vibration, and (b) what are the frequency and
wavelength of the sound wave produced? (c) Why is there a difference?
APPROACH The wavelength of the fundamental string vibration equals twice
the length of the string (Fig. 12–7). As the string vibrates, it pushes on the air,
which is thus forced to oscillate at the same frequency as the string.
SOLUTION (a) From Fig. 12–7 the wavelength of the fundamental is
This is the wavelength of the standing wave on the string.
(b) The sound wave that travels outward in the air (to reach our ears) has the
same frequency, 440 Hz. Its wavelength is
where v is the speed of sound in air (assumed at 20°C), Section 12–1.
(c) The wavelength of the sound wave is different from that of the
