) An electrolysis reaction, which is 
carried out in an electrolytic cell, employs an external source of elec-
tricity to drive a nonspontaneous electrochemical reaction. The 
current-carrying medium within an electrolytic cell may be either a 
molten salt or an electrolyte solution. The electrodes in an electro-
lytic cell can be inert or active, meaning that the electrode can be 
involved in the electrolysis reaction. Active electrodes are important 
in electroplating and in metallurgical processes.
The quantity of substances formed during electrolysis can be 
calculated by considering the number of electrons involved in the 
redox reaction and the amount of electrical charge that passes into 
the cell. The amount of electrical charge is measured in coulombs 
and is related to the magnitude of the current and the time it flows
