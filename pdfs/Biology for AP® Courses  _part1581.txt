d.
Replication of the lagging strand occurs in the
direction away from the replication fork in short
stretches of DNA, since access to the DNA is
always from the 3’ end. This results in pieces of
DNA being replicated in a discontinuous
fashion.
44. Explain the events taking place at the replication fork.
If the gene for helicase is mutated, what part of replication
will be affected?

a.
Helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin
of replication. Topoisomerase breaks and
reforms DNA’s phosphate backbone ahead of the
replication fork, thereby relieving the pressure.
Single-stranded binding proteins prevent
reforming of DNA. Primase synthesizes RNA
primer which is used by DNA polymerase to
form a daughter strand. If helicase is mutated,
the DNA strands will not be separated at the
beginning of replication.
b.
Helicase joins the DNA strands together at the
origin of replication. Topoisomerase breaks and
reforms DNA’s phosphate backbone
