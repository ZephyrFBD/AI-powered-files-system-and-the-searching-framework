The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle
The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the
preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining. These cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 22â€“32 day
cycle, with an average length of 28 days.
The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown in Figure 34.17. Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH
cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow,
they begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure
pregnancy. The trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there
are 30-60 cells. If pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels
rise and the me
