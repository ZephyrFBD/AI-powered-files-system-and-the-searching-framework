ring an enzymatic reaction, the substrate binds to the
active site of an enzyme. This means that the enzymes can
only catalyze one reaction at a time, which limits the reaction
rate.

2. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is an enzyme that
can use NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor. The table shows the Km and
kcat of this enzyme with the two cofactors. The Km represents the
substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of the
maximum rate. kcat is known as the turnover number and
represents how quickly the enzyme processes substrate
molecules.

Based on the data in the table, which cofactor yields the more
eﬀicient enzyme, and why?
NADP+, because the reaction reaches maxi
