ds: A Structure for
Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,” How did Watson and Crick’s model build on the findings of Rosalind Franklin?
How did their model of DNA build on the findings of Hershey and Chase, and others, showing that DNA can
encode and pass information on to the next generation?
Think About It
Watson and Crick’s work determined the structure of DNA. However, it was still relatively unknown how DNA
encoded information into genes. Select one modern form of biotechnology and research its basic methods online.
Examples include gene sequencing, DNA fingerprinting, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), genetically-modified food,
etc. Briefly describe your chosen technology, and what benefits it provides us. Then describe how Watson and Crick’s
findings were vital to the development of your chosen technology.
