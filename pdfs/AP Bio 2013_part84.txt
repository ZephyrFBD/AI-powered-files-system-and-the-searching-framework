 7. In an experiment, rats averaging 300 g of body mass were tested several times over a three-month period.  
For each individual rat, urine was collected over a three-hour period after ingestion of 10 mL of liquid (water, 
1% ethyl alcohol solution, or 5% ethyl alcohol solution). The volume of urine was then measured, and the results 
were averaged for all individuals within each experimental group. The data are shown in the table below.
