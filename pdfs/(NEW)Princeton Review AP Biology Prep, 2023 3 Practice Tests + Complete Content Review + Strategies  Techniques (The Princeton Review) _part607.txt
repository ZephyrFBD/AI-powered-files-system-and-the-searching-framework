ars, its enzymes would be optimized for a higher temperature. Therefore, we would expect to see the peak around
60°C with reaction rates dropping significantly at lower and higher temperatures.
d. Explain at a molecular level how gertimtonase may be affected with/by varying environmental temperatures.
Raising temperatures for Russian tortoises to those exceeding 37°C would likely denature the enzyme.
Denaturation of the enzyme greatly limits its function, which would lower the reaction rate.
