eps in cell signaling, the amplification of 
the signal, the recycling of relay molecules 
between activated and inactivated forms 
to regulate the cellular response, and the 
multiple roles of the same molecules in 
providing specificity. Using the principles 
of cell signaling, students should be able 
to explain—using claim, evidence, and 
reasoning—how a drug works or how 
the symptoms of a chronic disease arise. 
Students should understand that signal 
molecules bind to receptors and that 
gene expression can be stimulated by 
signal transduction.
Students may be expected to predict the 
effect on a cell if there is a disruption in the 
cell cycle. A common error on the exam is 
failure to explain the purpose and timing of 
the cell cycle checkpoints. Students should 
also be prepared to answer a comparative 
question about mitosis and meiosis.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 4, students continue to learn about the role of cells, focusing on how cells use energy 
and information
