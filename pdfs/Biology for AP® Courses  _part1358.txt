apply the sum and product rules. The probability of a homozygous dominant at A is 1/4 and the probability of a heterozygote
at A is 1/2. The probability of the homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule. The same probability
can be obtained in the same way for each of the other genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at A and B and
C and D is, using the product rule, equal to 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4, or 27/64. If you are ever unsure about how to combine
probabilities, returning to the forked-line method should make it clear.
