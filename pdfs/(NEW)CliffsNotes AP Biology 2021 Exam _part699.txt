t, if sea otters are removed, sea urchins increase
and kelp forests dissipate. Thus, sea otters, comprising the top trophic tier, regulate the population size of the kelp,
the bottom tier. Many examples of the top-down model are created by humans when they remove top predators
(often keystone species) by overhunting or habitat destruction.
The biodiversity of an ecosystem is expressed as a function of the number of species, niches, and trophic levels in
the ecosystem and the complexity of its food web. In addition to the interactions between species and trophic levels
described above, a number of factors influence biodiversity:
1. Climate is a strong determinant of biodiversity. The amount, variability, and form of water (precipitation as rain
or snow, presence of rivers or other bodies of water) strongly influence the abundance and type of primary producers
and the number of species primary production can support. The range of temperatures between night and day as well
as throughout t
