el B will increase. This will cause the amount
of food that organisms in trophic level B feed on to decrease, so the biomass
of trophic level C will decrease.
Reduce the biomass of trophic level D and
C, and increase the biomass of trophic
level B
Reduce the biomass of trophic level D and
B, and increase the biomass of trophic
level C
Invasive predator eats D; fewer D to eat B,
more B to eat C
Invasive predator outcompetes D for B; D
die oﬀ; fewer B to eat C
3. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 3
(a) Describe how environmental factors aﬀect phenotypic plasticity, the
ability of one genotype to exhibit diﬀerent phenotypes in diﬀerent
environments. (1 point)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Phenotypic plasticity is influenced by the external environment organisms live
in, as well as the organism’s internal environment. External factors include
temperature, light, and nutrients, and internal factors include
