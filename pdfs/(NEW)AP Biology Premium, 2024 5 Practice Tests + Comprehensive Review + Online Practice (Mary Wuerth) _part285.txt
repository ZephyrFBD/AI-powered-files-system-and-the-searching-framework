ee genes on the genetic map from part (a).
(c) A new gene, D, is discovered on the same chromosome. A and D have a recombination frequency of 10%.
B and D have a recombination frequency of 35%. On your genetic map from part (a), draw an additional
line to represent the relative location of gene D on the chromosome.
(d) A different chromosome in the organism has genes, M, N, O, and P. One copy has the alleles MNOP. The
other copy of the chromosome has the alleles mnop. If genetic recombination occurred between genes N
and O, explain the two possible gametes that would be produced by this crossing-over event.
12. An organism has a diploid number of six chromosomes.
(a) Determine the number of chromosomes in each of the four cells that would be produced upon the
completion of meiosis II.
(b) Based on your answer to part (a), explain why the cells would each have that number of chromosomes at
the end of meiosis II.
(c) A nondisjunction event occurred during anaphase II. Predict the number
