side of the cell. Ligand-gated ion channels, catalytic receptors, and G-protein-linked receptors are common
examples.
The cell cycle is divided into interphase and mitosis, or cellular division.
The three stages of interphase are G1, G2, and S phase.
S phase is the “synthesis” phase, when chromosomes replicate.
Growth and preparation for mitosis occur in G1 and G2.
Cell cycle progression is controlled by checkpoint pathways and CDK/cyclin complexes.
Cancer occurs when cells grow abnormally and spread to other parts of the body. Tumor-suppressor genes are
genes that prevent the cell from dividing when it shouldn’t. Proto-oncogenes are genes that help the cell divide.
If either type is mutated (a mutated proto-oncogene is called an oncogene), it can lead to cell growth that is out
of control.
Mitosis, or cellular division, occurs in four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
During prophase, the nuclear envelope disappears and chromosomes condense.
Next is metaphase, when
