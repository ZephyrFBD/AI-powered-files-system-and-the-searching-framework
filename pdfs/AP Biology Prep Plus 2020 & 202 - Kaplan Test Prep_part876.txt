Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
A solution is isotonic when movement of water in and out of a cell is equal,
meaning in this case that the mass of the egg would not change. According to the
data, a zero change in mass would occur between the concentrations that caused
changes of 0.3 g and â€“6.1 g, which correspond to the 10% and 20% corn syrup
solutions, respectively. Thus, the percentage of corn syrup for the isotonic
solution would fall somewhere between 10% and 20%.
(d) Suppose an egg from the 100% corn syrup solution was then immersed
into pure distilled water. Predict what would happen to the egg, and justify
your response. (2 points)
