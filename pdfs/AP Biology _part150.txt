The cell cycle consists of interphase (G1, G2, and S), mitosis, and
cytokinesis. The graph above shows changing DNA concentrations
during the various stages of the cell cycle. Which of the following
statements correctly identifies the stage of the cell cycle and also
includes the correct support for that claim?
Stage IV is S because the amount of DNA decreases.
Stage II is G1 and G2 because the amount of DNA increases.
Stage II is S because the amount of DNA increases.
Stage III is interphase because there is no change in the amount
of DNA in the nucleus.
Researchers are investigating the relationships among different
organisms in the animal kingdom based on differences and
similarities in their cell cycles. Which of the following scientific
