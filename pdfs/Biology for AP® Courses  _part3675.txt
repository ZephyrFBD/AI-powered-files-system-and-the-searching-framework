 ostia. This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange. An open circulatory system
does not use as much energy as a closed system to operate or to maintain; however, there is a trade-off with the amount of
blood that can be moved to metabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels of oxygen. In fact, one reason
that insects with wing spans of up to two feet wide (70 cm) are not around today is probably because they were outcompeted
by the arrival of birds 150 million years ago. Birds, having a closed circulatory system, are thought to have moved more
agilely, allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey on the insects.
Figure 31.2 In (a) closed circulatory systems, the heart pumps blood through vessels that are separate from the
interstitial fluid of the body. Most vertebrates and some invertebrates, like this annelid earthworm, have a closed
circulatory system. In (b) open circulatory systems, a fluid called hemolymph is pumped through a blood vessel that
