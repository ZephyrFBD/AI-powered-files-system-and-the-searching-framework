replaced by 
other plant species, the long-term effects can be minimized. 
Based on considerations, the student is able to explain how 
populations and communities with species diversity (e.g., a 
prairie) are more stable and better able to withstand changes 
to the environment.
Characteristics of a 
GOOD Response 
(Part a) With less elaboration, the student is able to 
write a coherent paragraph to explain why all organisms 
require free energy and matter to survive and identifies 
photosynthesis as an energy-producing strategy associated 
with plants, including prairie grass. The student is able 
to explain through narrative or diagram with annotation 
the general process of the electron transport chain and its 
associated proteins and its role in the production of energy 
in light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The student 
identifies ATP and NADPH as energy-carrying molecules. 
The student is able to predict two to three consequences of a 
virus that acts by disrupting the
