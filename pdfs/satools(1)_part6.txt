The motivations and use of methods implemented in SA Tools are discussed in the book referenced in 
section 1 of this document. 
 
4.  How do I code my own problem? 
4.1.  For Matlab 
 
Version 1.03 and later contain the convenience function mktemplate for auto-generating the basic files 
a user needs to get started. 
 
1. Start Matlab if it is not already running. 
 
2. Go to your work directory. 
 
3. Choose a name for your problem.  It should be of moderate length and also suitable for a 
directory name. 
 
4. Execute 
>> mktemplate('problem') ; 
where 'problem' is the selected problem name (in single quotes). 
 
5. A directory with the same name as your problem containing 5 Matlab m-files will be created.  
Matlab will change its current directory to this new directory. 
 
6. The generated files are fully functional â€“ although the returned cost is simply a random number.  
To execute, run the familiar function 
>> try_me
