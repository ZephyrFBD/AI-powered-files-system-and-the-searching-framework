 race” is thereby constantly occurring between host and pathogen.
The host is constantly trying to fight off pathogens through the
development of active immunity, and the pathogen (virus) is constantly
trying to evolve so that it is effectively able to invade and attack the host
organism.
(c) Describe how vaccination is based on immunological memory. (3

Description (3 points)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The immunological memory of an immune system can remember antigens
and mount a greater and faster immunological response upon re-
encounter of the same antigens. For instance, if the body has been invaded
by the virus before, it will “remember” how to fight off the virus because
Immunological memory leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with
an antigen.
Vaccines contain inactive virus strains or parts.
Vaccination evokes a mild, primary immune response to enable a greater secondary
response.
