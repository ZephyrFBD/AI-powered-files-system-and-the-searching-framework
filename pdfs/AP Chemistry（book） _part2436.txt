her, these changes alter the partial pressures 
of the gaseous substances. In Sample Exercise 15.7, we calculated Kp = 2.79 * 10-5 
for the Haber reaction, N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2, in an equilibrium mixture at 
472 °C containing 7.38 atm H2, 2.46 atm N2, and 0.166 atm NH3. Consider what happens 
when we suddenly reduce the volume of the system by one-half. If there were no shift 
in equilibrium, this volume change would cause the partial pressures of all substances 
to double, giving P
H2 = 14.76 atm, PN2 = 4.92 atm, and P
NH3 = 0.332 atm. The reaction 
quotient would then no longer equal the equilibrium constant:
Q p =

14.922114.7623 = 6.97 * 10-6 ≠Kp
Because Q p 6 Kp, the system would no longer be at equilibrium. Equilibrium 
would be reestablished by increasing P
NH3 and decreasing both P
N2 and P
H2 until 
Q p = Kp = 2.79 * 10-5. Therefore, the equilibrium shifts to the right in the reaction as 
written, as Le Châtelier’s principle predicts.
