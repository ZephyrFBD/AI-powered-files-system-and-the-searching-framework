 water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does
phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (Figure 5.21).

A variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis. This process uses a coating protein, called caveolin, on the cytoplasmic
side of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin. The cavities in the plasma membrane that form
the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin. The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae
(singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to
transport these molecules t
