a collection of communication and
socialization behaviors. Evidence of inheritance of genes
predisposing the individual during early development is
indicated by pedigrees such as the following (after Allen-
Brady, Molecular Psychiatry, 14, 2009). Males (squares)
and females (circles) are affected when the symbol is
filled, are struck through when deceased and the genome
cannot be determined, and are dashed when living and the
genome was not determined.

A. Other evidence indicates that autism is not x-linked.
Give an alternative explanation that can account for
these data.
B. Stem cells taken from fathers who do not present
characteristic of autism and from their sons were induced
to form tissue cultures of neurons. Compared to the father
those taken from the son showed accelerated growth with
a higher number of synapses. Describe possible
consequences for the integration of information if this in
vitro growth also occurs in vivo.
