abstraction: 
RCOOH + tOH- ¡  RCOOt +  H2O; 
deprotonation: RCOOH + OH- ¡  RCOO- +  H2O. Hydroxyl 
radical is more toxic to living systems because it produces other radi-
cals when it reacts with molecules in the organism. Hydroxide ion, 
OH-, on the other hand, will be readily neutralized in the buffered 
cell environment. The acid–base reactions of OH- are usually much 
in part (b). (d) At ambient conditions, E ≈E°, so log Q ≈1. Assum-
ing that the value of E° is relatively constant with temperature, the 
value of the second term in the Nernst equation is approximately 
zero at 37 °C, and E ≈3.5 V. 20.77 (a) The cell emf will have a
