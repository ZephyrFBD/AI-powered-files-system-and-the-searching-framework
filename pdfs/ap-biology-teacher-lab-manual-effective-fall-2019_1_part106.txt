of each species. In the following example, there are four main stages: (1) constructing a 
model game, (2) writing assumptions out as word equations, (3) abstracting the word

equations into arithmetic equations, and (4) generating a calculator or spreadsheet  
graphic model of the game played over time. Afterward, there are the following  
summative activities: (1) checking the model against real data, (2) considering  
alternative models, and (3) recognizing the limitations of the model.  
■ Part 1: The FOXRAB Game: 
The Construction of a Model Game 
Construct a game board by modifying a checkerboard/  
chessboard with colored tape, so that it is divided into 16  
sets of four cells (2 X 2) (see Figure 7). This represents the  
environment. You will also need beans (or other markers) of  
two different colors to represent “Foxes and Rabbits.”  
•  Each team starts with a board and 20 beans of one color
