 m from the cup. Calculate the allowable range
of initial velocities we may impart to the ball so that it stops
in the range 1.0 m short to 1.0 m long of the cup. Do the
same for a downhill lie 7.0 m from the cup. What in your
results suggests that the downhill putt is more difficult?

CHAPTER 2
Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension
1. Discuss two conditions given in Section 2â€“7 for being able
to use a constant acceleration of magnitude
.
Give an example in which one of these conditions would
not be met and would not even be a reasonable approxima-
tion of motion.
2. In a lecture demonstration, a 3.0-m-long vertical string
with ten bolts tied to it at equal intervals is dropped from
the ceiling of the lecture hall. The string falls on a tin
plate, and the class hears the clink of each bolt as it hits
the plate. (a) The sounds will not occur at equal time inter-
vals. Why? (b) Will the time between clinks increase or
decrease as the string falls? (c) How cou
