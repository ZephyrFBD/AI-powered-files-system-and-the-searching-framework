H3 to NO:
 
 
4 NH31g2 + 5 O21g2 ยก 4 NO1g2 + 6 H2O1g2
 
 In a certain experiment, 2.00 g of NH3 reacts with 2.50 g of 
O2. (a) Which is the limiting reactant? (b) How many grams 
of NO and H2O form? (c) How many grams of the excess re-
actant  
remain after the limiting reactant is  
completely con-
sumed? (d) Show that your calculations in parts (b) and (c) 
are consistent with the law of conservation of mass.
 3.81 Solutions of sodium carbonate and silver nitrate react to 
form solid silver carbonate and a solution of sodium nitrate. 
A solution containing 3.50 g of sodium carbonate is mixed 
with one containing 5.00 g of silver nitrate. How many grams 
of sodium carbonate, silver nitrate, silver carbonate, and so-
dium nitrate are present after the reaction is complete?
 3.82  Solutions of sulfuric acid and lead(II) acetate react to form solid 
lead(II) sulfate and a solution of acetic acid. If 5.00 g of sulfuric 
acid and 5.00 g of lead(II) acetate are mixed, calculate the num-
