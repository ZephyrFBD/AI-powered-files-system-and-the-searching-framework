the 
skin. In contrast, most alpha rays are stopped by skin, and beta rays are able to penetrate 
only about 1 cm beyond the skin surface (Figure 21.23). Therefore, neither alpha rays nor 
beta rays are as dangerous as gamma rays, unless the radiation source somehow enters 
the body. Within the body, alpha rays are particularly dangerous because they transfer 
their energy efficiently to the surrounding tissue, causing considerable damage.

In general, the tissues damaged most by radiation are those that reproduce rapidly, 
such as bone marrow, blood-forming tissues, and lymph nodes. The principal effect of 
extended exposure to low doses of radiation is to cause cancer. Cancer is caused by da
