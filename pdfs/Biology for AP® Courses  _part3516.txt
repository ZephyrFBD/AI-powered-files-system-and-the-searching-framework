a.
It occurs when ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate.
b.
It occurs a new molecule of ATP attaches to the myosin head.
c.
It occurs when ADP and phosphate separate from the myosin head.
d.
It occurs when ADP and phosphate separate from the actin active site.

Describe the steps involved in the cross-bridge muscle contraction process.
a.
The myosin head forms a cross-bridge with actin, which initiates the power stroke. During the power stroke,
the myosin head bends with the release of ADP and inorganic phosphate. Another ATP binds to the myosin
head, causing the cross-bridge to detach and returning myosin to the cocked configuration.
b.
The actin head forms a cross-bridge with myosin which initiates the power stroke. During the power stroke,
the actin head bends w
