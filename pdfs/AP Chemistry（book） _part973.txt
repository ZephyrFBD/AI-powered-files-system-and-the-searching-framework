electron each. The fourth electron is then paired up with 
one of the three electrons already in a 2p orbital, so that the 
orbital diagram is
1s
2s
2p
The corresponding electron configuration is written 1s22s22p4. 
The atom has two unpaired electrons.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How many of the elements in the second row of the periodic 
table (Li through Ne) will have at least one unpaired elec-
tron in their electron configurations?  
(a) 3 (b) 4 (c) 5 (d) 6 (e) 7
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Write the electron configuration for silicon, element 14, 
in its ground state. (b) How many unpaired electrons does a 
ground-state silicon atom possess?
