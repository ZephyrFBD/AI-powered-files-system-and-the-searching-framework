In diffusion, a substance moves down its concentration gradient from an area of higher
concentration to an area of lower concentration.
Substances moved are small, uncharged, and nonpolar molecules (e.g., carbon dioxide and
oxygen).
Substances move directly across the lipid bilayer.
ii. In facilitated diffusion, transport proteins move charged molecules (e.g., potassium ions) and
larger molecules (e.g., glucose) into and out of the cell.
As with diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves a substance down its concentration gradient
from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without the use of ATP.
Unlike diffusion, however, the substance moves with the help of carrier proteins or through a
channel protein.
Examples of facilitated diffusion include: glucose transport and Na+/K+ transport.
iii. Osmosis causes water to move across the plasma membrane from a hypotonic solution to a
hypertonic solution.
Hypotonic solution (high water potential, lo
