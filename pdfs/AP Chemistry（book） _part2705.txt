â–² Figure 17.3 Calculating the pH of a buffer after addition of a strong acid or strong base.
A buffer is made by adding 0.300 mol CH3COOH and 0.300 mol CH3COONa to enough water to make 1.000 L of solution. The 
pH of the buffer is 4.74 (Sample Exercise 17.1). (a) Calculate the pH of this solution after 5.0 mL of 4.0 M NaOH1aq2 solution 
is added. (b) For comparison, calculate the pH of a solution made by adding 5.0 mL of 4.0 M NaOH1aq2 solution to 1.000 L of 
pure water.
Analyze We are asked to determine the pH of a buffer after addition 
of a small amount of strong base and to compare the pH change 
with the pH that would result if we were to add the same amount 
of strong base to pure water.
Plan Solving this problem involves the two steps outlined in 
Figure 17.3. First we do a stoichiometry calculation to determine 
how the added OH-
