y between 8.12 grams and 8.22 grams. The actual mass
of the returned diamond is most likely between 8.04 grams and 8.14 grams.
These two ranges overlap, so the data do not give you a strong reason to
doubt that the returned diamond is yours.
Significant Figures
The number of reliably known digits in a number is called the number of
significant figures. Thus there are four significant figures in the number 23.21 cm
and two in the number 0.062 cm (the zeros in the latter are merely place holders
that show where the decimal point goes). The number of significant figures may not
always be clear. Take, for example, the number 80. Are there one or two signifi-
cant figures? We need words here: If we say it is roughly 80 km between two
cities, there is only one significant figure (the 8) since the zero is merely a place
holder. If there is no suggestion that the 80 is a rough approximation, then we
can often assume (as we will in this book) that it is 80 km within an accuracy of
about 1 or 2
