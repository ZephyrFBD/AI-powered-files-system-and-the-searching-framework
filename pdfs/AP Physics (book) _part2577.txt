SOLUTION (a) Given

and 
(Remember to take the reciprocal!) Because 
is negative,
the image must be virtual and on the same side of the lens as the object (sign
convention 3, page 665). The magnification
The image is three times as large as the object and is upright. This lens is being
used as a magnifying glass, which we discuss in more detail in Section 25–3.
(b) The ray diagram is shown in Fig. 23–43 and confirms the result in part (a). We
choose point 
on the top of the object and draw ray 1. Ray 2, however, may
take some thought: if we draw it heading toward 
it is going the wrong way—so
we have to draw it as if coming from 
(and so dashed), striking the lens, and
then going out parallel to the lens axis. We project it backward, with a dashed
line, as we must do also for ray 1, in order to find where they cross. Ray 3 is drawn
through the lens center, and it crosses the other two rays at the image point,
