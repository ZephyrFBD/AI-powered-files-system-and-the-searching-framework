.
(A)
Species B must have diverged from species D.
(B)
Species B or D must be the common ancestor for the other three
species of anoles.
(C)
Species B and D diverged more recently from a common ancestor
than from other species.
(D)
53. Which of the following statements provides the best evidence that the
anoles are a separate species?
UV reflectance of the dewlap makes it diﬀicult for related species to
communicate.
(A)
One of the species is stronger and better at hunting than the others.
(B)
Anoles that breed outside of their group cannot produce viable,
fertile oﬀspring.
(C)
The separate species occupy diﬀerent environments and thus have
diﬀerent food sources.
(D)
54. Following a wildfire, a large population of species D migrated to a
grassland inhabited by species A. Aȇer several generations, it was found
that most of the new juveniles from species D had UV reflectance values
closer to those of species A. What is the most likely reason for this trend?
Higher UV reflectance provides
