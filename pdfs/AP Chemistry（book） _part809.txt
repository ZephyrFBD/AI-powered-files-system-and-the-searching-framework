 of CO2 and  
5 mol of H2O. Everything is then balanced except for oxygen. We 
have an odd number of oxygen atoms on the right. We can balance 
the oxygen by using the coefficient 1
2 for O2 on the right:
2 C3H5N3O91l2 ¡  3 N21g2 + 6 CO21g2 + 5 H2O1l2 + 1
2 O21g2
We multiply through by 2 to convert all coefficients to whole numbers:
4 C3H5N3O91l2 ¡  6 N21g2 + 12 CO21g2 + 10 H2O1l2 + O21g2
(At the temperature of the explosion, water is a gas rather than a 
liquid as shown in the equation above. The rapid expansion of the 
gaseous products creates the force of an explosion.)
(b) We can obtain the standard enthalpy of formation of nitro-
glycerin by using the heat of decomposition of trinitroglycerin 
together with the standard enthalpies of formation of the other 
substances in the decomposition equation:
4 C3H5N3O91l2 ¡  6 N21g2 + 12 CO21g2 + 10 H2O1l2 + O21g2
-6165.6 kJ = 121-393.5 kJ2 + 101-285.8 kJ2 - 4∆Hf°3C3H5N3O91l24 
∆Hf°3C3H5N3O91l24 = -353.6 kJ>mol
