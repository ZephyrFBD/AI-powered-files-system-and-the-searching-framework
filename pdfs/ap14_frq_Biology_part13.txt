ird nerve fiber. This third nerve fiber extends out of the spinal cord to the left, and then it curves upward in a clockwise direction, toward the bottom illustration of the finger, and ends in a cluster of three tube-like shapes that are positioned inside the bottom illustration of the finger. The cluster of three tube-like shapes is labeled Skeletal Muscle Fibers. The third nerve fiber is shown making multiple connections with the tube-like shapes. Positioned over the third nerve fiber is an arrow pointing away from the spinal cord and toward the bottom illustration of the finger. The arrow is labeled Signal Direction.
 6. Information processing involves complex neural pathways that require a certain amount of time between 
recognition of a stimulus and the resulting response. For some types of stimuli, a reflex arc replaces the typical 
stimulus-response pathway. A representation of a reflex arc is shown in the figure above. 
  Based on the figure, describe TWO ways that the reflex
