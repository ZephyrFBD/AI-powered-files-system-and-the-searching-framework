t cell receives
information through receptors on its surface, which are generally
membrane-spanning proteins with binding domains on the outside of the
plasma membrane.
Cells communicate with each other using a wide variety of molecules.
Some can pass through the membranes of the target cell to act directly
within the cell’s cytoplasm or nucleus. Others bind to receptors on the
cell membrane and act through second messenger systems to alter a
process within the cell. All of these molecules can be considered
8.1 Diﬀerentiate between stimulatory and inhibitory transduction
signaling
8.2 Explain how selective pressure impacts pathway choice
8.3 Describe receptor recognition of ligands and protein shape
change
8.4 Explain how blocking transduction or reception aﬀects cells
hormones, circulating signal molecules that are released by specialized
cells and travel throughout the bloodstream.
Responses to signal transduction (the conversion of an extracellular
signal to a change in an intracell
