he bottleneck effect in a population.
(b) 90% of the habitat of a spotted owl colony was destroyed by a wildfire. A small percentage of the
surviving owl population migrated to a new habitat. Explain the type of genetic drift this illustrates.
(c) The banana slug, Ariolimax columbianus, lives in the redwood forest in the mountains near Santa Cruz,
California. A wildfire in these mountains in the summer of 2019 divided the slugâ€™s habitat with a large area
of dry ash that the slugs cannot cross. Predict the effect this had on the genetic diversity of the banana slug
population.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).

13. The California kangaroo rat, Dipodomys ingens, is considered an ecosystem engineer for its role in creating
extensive burrowing systems that can change soil characteristics and provide habitats for other species. Fur
color in D. ingens ranges from white to sandy to brown. Ecologists counted the number of D. ingens in an area
before and five years af
