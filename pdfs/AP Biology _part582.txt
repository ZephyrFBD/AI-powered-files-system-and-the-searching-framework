of other
individuals. Young wild chimps learn how to crack open oil palm nuts
with stones by copying experienced chimps. Wild vervet monkeys in
Kenya learn to make alarm calls. At first, they make indiscriminate calls in
response to danger and later fine tune the call as they learn from older
monkeys in the group.
SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
Social behavior is any kind of interaction among two or more animals,
usually of the same species. It is a relatively new field of study, developed
in the 1960s. Types of social behaviors are cooperation, agonistic
behavior, dominance hierarchies, territoriality, and altruism.
Cooperation
Cooperation enables the individuals to carry out a behavior, such as
hunting, that they can do as a group more successfully than they can do
separately. Lions or wild dogs will hunt in a pack, enabling them to bring
down a larger animal than an individual could ever bring down alone.

Cooperative behaviors tend to increase the fitness of the individual and the group.
