ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.H.1
Evolution is also driven by random 
occurrences—
a.	Mutation is a random process that 
contributes to evolution.
b.	Genetic drift is a nonselective process 
occurring in small populations—
 i.	 Bottlenecks.
ii.	 Founder effect.
c.	Migration/gene flow can drive evolution.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
EVO-1
Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population over 
time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.

EVO-1.I
Describe the role of random 
processes in the evolution of 
specific populations.
EVO-1.J
Describe the change in 
the genetic makeup of a 
population over time.
EVO-1.I.1
Reduction of genetic variation within a given 
population can increase the differences 
between populations of the same species.
EVO-1.J.1
Mutation results in genetic variation, which 
provides phenotypes on which natural 
selection acts.
