Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed, incorrectly, that the process of
inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this
hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. Continuous variation
results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to be a “blend” of
their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. The blending theory of inheritance
asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is
not the case. Mendel was the first researcher to see it. Instead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with traits that
were inherited in distinct classes (specifically, violet versus white flower
