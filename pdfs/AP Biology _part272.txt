mental influence. Examples are heart
disease, diabetes, cancer, alcoholism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.
Similarly, the development of intelligence is the result of an interaction of
genetic predisposition and the environment, or nurture and nature.
SYI-3
Environmental factors influence the expression of the genotype in an organism.
Penetrance
Penetrance is the proportion or percentage of individuals in a group with a
given genotype that actually shows the expected phenotype. For example,
many people who inherit a mutant allele for BRCA1 develop breast cancer
in their lifetimes. For reasons that are unknown, some people with the
allele do not develop breast cancer. Perhaps this is caused by an interaction
with some other gene or some factor from the environment.
LINKED GENES
Genes on the same chromosome are called linked genes. Since there are
many more genes than chromosomes, thousands of genes are linked.
Humans have 46 chromosomes in every cell. Therefore, humans have 46
