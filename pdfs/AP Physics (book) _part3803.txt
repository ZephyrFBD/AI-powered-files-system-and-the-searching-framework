51. Use dimensional analysis with the fundamental constants
c, G, and 
to estimate the value of the so-called Planck time.
It is thought that physics as we know it can say nothing
about the universe before this time.
52. Estimate the mass of our observable universe using the
following assumptions: Our universe is spherical in shape,
it has been expanding at the speed of light since the Big
Bang, and its density is the critical density.
U
A: Our Earth and ourselves, 2 years ago.
B: 600 ly (estimating L from Fig. 33â€“6 as
note that on a log scale, 6000 K is closer to 7000 K than it
is to 5000 K).
L L 8 * 1026 W;
C: 30 km.
D: (a); not the usual 
but R: see formula for the
Schwarzschild radius.
E: (c); (d).

ANSWERS TO EXERCISES
1. Estimate what neutrino mass (in 
) would provide the
critical density to close the universe. Assume the neutrino
density is, like photons, about 
times that of nucleons
