His, nodal tissue that passes down between both ventricles and then branches into the ventricles through the
Purkinje fibers. This impulse results in the contraction of the ventricles.
3. When the ventricles contract (the systole phase), blood is forced through the pulmonary arteries and aorta. Also,
the AV valves are forced to close. When the ventricles relax (the diastole phase), backflow into the ventricles causes
the semilunar valves to close. The closing of AV valves, followed by the closing of the semilunar valves, produces
the characteristic “lub-dup” sounds of the heart.
Hydrostatic pressure created by the heart forces blood to move through the arteries. As blood reaches the capillaries,
however, blood pressure drops dramatically. Blood continues to move through the veins, principally as a result of
the movements of adjacent skeletal muscles that squeeze the blood vessels. Blood moves in the direction of the heart
because valves in the veins prevent backflow.
