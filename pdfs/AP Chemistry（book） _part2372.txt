hree components 
of the reaction mixture present at the same time.
How the concentrations of H2, N2, and NH3 vary with time is shown in Figure 15.4. 
Notice that an equilibrium mixture is obtained regardless of whether we begin with 
N2 and H2 or with NH3. The equilibrium condition is reached from either direction.
Go Figure
Is the rate of disappearance of H2 related to the rate of 
disappearance of N2? If so, how they are related?

Starting with only products
â–² Figure 15.4 The same equilibrium is reached whether we start with only reactants (N2 and H2) or 
with only product 1NH32.
Give It Some Thought
True or False: You can determine if equilibrium has been reached by monitoring the 
concentration of a single reactant.
An expression similar to Equation 15.5 governs the concentrations of N2, H2,
and NH3 at equilibrium. If we were to systematically change the r
