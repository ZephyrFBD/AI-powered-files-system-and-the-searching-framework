Figure 30.20 The oxygen dissociation curve demonstrates that, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases,
more oxygen binds hemoglobin. However, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen may shift to the left or the right
depending on environmental conditions.
The kidneys are responsible for removing excess hydrogen ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen
to blood pH and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen?
a.
The blood pH will drop and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will increase.
b.
The blood pH will increase and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will drop.
c.
The blood pH will drop and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will decrease.
d.
The blood pH will increase and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen will also increase.
Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding
The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to PO2 ,
other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying ca
