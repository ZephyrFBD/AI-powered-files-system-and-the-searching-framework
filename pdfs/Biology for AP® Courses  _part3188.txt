different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of
stimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity. For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are
each activated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or
pressure. However, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our
sense of taste.
Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information
Four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in
the receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted
over a sensory receptorâ€™s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other
sensory circuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own
