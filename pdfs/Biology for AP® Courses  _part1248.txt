Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms
Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles. What happens between these two events depends on the organism.
The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid gametes, restores
the diploid condition. There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant, in
which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life sta
