ally significant difference in the number of
cells in interphase and mitosis in the control (untreated) and treated groups. Sample data and the chi-square
calculation to evaluate the null hypothesis follow. (For a review of how to complete a chi-square calculation, review
Chapter 2).
Since there are four possible outcomes in this experiment, the number of degrees of freedom (df) is 4 â€“ 1 = 3.
Using a p-value of 0.05, the critical value from the chi-square table is 7.81. Since the calculated chi-square value of
0.881 is less than the critical value of 7.81, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Part 3: In this part of the lab, karyotypes from normal and cancerous cells are compared. A karyotype is a picture
of the chromosomes in a dividing cell. Karyotypes can show abnormalities in the number of chromosomes in a cell
caused by errors in cell division. Recall that control of cell division is monitored at checkpoints. These checkpoints
monitor for proper ratios of cyclins and cyclin-depende
