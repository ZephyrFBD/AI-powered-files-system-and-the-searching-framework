 fruit, is a six-carbon ketone 
sugar (Figure 24.19).
The glucose molecule, having both alcohol and aldehyde functional groups and a 
reasonably long and flexible backbone, can form a six-member-ring structure, as shown 
in Figure 24.20. In fact, in an aqueous solution only a small percentage of the glucose 
molecules are in the open-chain form. Although the ring is often drawn as if it were pla-
nar, the molecules are actually nonplanar because of the tetrahedral bond angles around 
the C and O atoms of the ring.
Figure 24.20 shows that the ring structure of glucose can have two relative orienta-
tions. In the a form the OH group on C1 and the CH2OH group on C5 point in opposite 
directions, and in the b form they point in the same direction. Although the difference
