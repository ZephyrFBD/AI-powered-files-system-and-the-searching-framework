nd wider the barrier, the less time the 
particle has to escape and the less likely
it is to do so. It is therefore the height and width of this barrier that control the
rate of decay and half-life of an isotope.
30–13 Detection of Particles
Individual particles such as electrons, protons,
particles, neutrons, and 
rays
are not detected directly by our senses. Consequently, a variety of instruments
have been developed to detect them.
Counters
One of the most common detectors is the Geiger counter. As shown in Fig. 30–13,
it consists of a cylindrical metal tube filled with a certain type of gas. A long 
wire runs down the center and is kept at a high positive voltage 
with
respect to the outer cylinder. The voltage is just slightly less than that required 
to ionize the gas atoms. When a charged particle enters through the thin “window”
at one end of the tube, it ionizes a few atoms of the gas. The freed electrons are
attracted toward the positive wire, and as they are accelerated they
