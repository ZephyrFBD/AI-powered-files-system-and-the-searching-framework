Kepler’s Third Law Derived, Sun’s Mass, Perturbations
We will derive Kepler’s third law for the special case of a circular orbit, in 
which case the mean distance s is the radius r of the circle. (Most planetary orbits
are close to a circle.) First, we write Newton’s second law of motion,
For F we use the law of universal gravitation (Eq. 5–4) for the force between the
Sun and a planet of mass 
and for a the centripetal acceleration,

Kepler’s third law
assume the mass of the Sun 
is much greater than the mass of its planets, so we
ignore the effects of the planets on each other. Then
Here 
is the mass of a particular planet,
its distance from the Sun, and 
its speed in orbit;
is the mass of the Sun, since it is the gra
