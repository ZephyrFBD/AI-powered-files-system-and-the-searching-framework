house is
maintained at 22°C by the continuous operation of a 5-ton
air conditioning system, how much does this cooling cost
the homeowner per hour? Assume the work done by the
refrigeration unit is powered by electricity that costs
$0.10 per kWh and that the unit’s coefficient of performance
is 18% that of an ideal refrigerator.
64. Two 1100-kg cars are traveling 
in opposite direc-
tions when they collide and are brought to rest. Estimate
the change in entropy of the universe as a result of this 
collision. Assume

water at 45°C. After a few minutes, equilibrium is reached.
(a) Determine the final temperature, and (b) estimate the
total change in entropy.
