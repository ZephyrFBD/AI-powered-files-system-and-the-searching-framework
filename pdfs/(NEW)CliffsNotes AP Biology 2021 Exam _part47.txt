ting a pair of shared electrons (one electron from carbon
and one from another atom). Complex molecules can be formed by stringing carbon atoms together in a straight line
or by connecting carbons together to form rings. The presence of nitrogen, oxygen, and other atoms adds additional
variety to these carbon molecules.
Many organic molecules share similar properties because they have similar clusters of atoms, called functional
groups. Each functional group gives the molecule a particular property, such as acidity or polarity. The more
common functional groups with their properties are listed in Figure 2-4.

Four important classes of organic molecules—carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids—are discussed in
the following sections. Although specific examples are provided, the AP exam does not require that you know their
formulas. However, you should know the general characteristics that distinguish one group of molecules from
another.
