 good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he’d see us all 
 
 at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn’t know what a priest was, 
 
 God help us. 
 
 At the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, 
 
 no, not that way. Not the front gate.They use the front door only for 
 
 visits from the priest or funerals. 
 
 We make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad 
 
 pushes in the door and there’s Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a 
 
 big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something. 
 
 Och, says Grandpa, you’re here. 
 
 Och, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother.This is Angela, he 
 
 says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says 
 
 nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the 
 
 kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down 
 
 and have some tea.Would you like boxty?
