those
in animals, but serve essentially the same purpose. Plant viruses,
however, oȇen exploit plasmodesmata because the openings allow the
virus particles to spread rapidly from one section of the plant to others.

IF YOU TAKE AWAY ONLY 4 THINGS FROM THIS
CHAPTER:
There are two major ways animal cells communicate: through
signaling molecules secreted by cells and through receptor
molecules that rest on the cells’ surfaces. 
1.
Responses to signal transduction (the conversion of an
extracellular signal to a change in an intracellular process) may
be stimulatory or inhibitory.
2.
Endocrine signaling refers to the secretion of chemical
messengers for widespread distribution throughout the entire
organism. Paracrine signaling refers to the process of signaling
only nearby cells. Synaptic signaling occurs between a nerve
cell and either another nerve cell, a gland cell, or a muscle cell.
3.
The cells of many tissues contain pores known as gap junctions
that allow
