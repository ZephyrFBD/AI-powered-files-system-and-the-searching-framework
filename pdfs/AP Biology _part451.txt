ciation
Allopatric speciation is caused by geographic isolation: separation by
mountain ranges, canyons, rivers, lakes, glaciers, altitude, or longitude.
Sympatric Speciation
Under certain circumstances, speciation may occur without geographic
isolation, in which case the cause of the speciation is sympatric. Examples
of sympatric speciation are polyploidy, habitat isolation, behavioral
isolation, temporal isolation, and reproductive isolation.
Polyploidy: This is the condition where a cell has more than two
complete sets of chromosomes (4n, 8n, etc.). It is common in plants
and can occur naturally or through breeding. It results from
nondisjunction during meiosis when gametes with the 2n
chromosome number are fertilized by another abnormal (2n)
gamete, resulting in a daughter cell with 4n chromosomes. Plants
that are polyploid cannot breed with others of the same species that
are not polyploid and are functionally isolated from them. See
