ility. 
Note that the vapor pressure in all cases increases nonlinearly with 
increasing temperature. The weaker the intermolecular forces in 
the liquid, the more easily molecules can escape and, therefore, the 
higher the vapor pressure at a given temperature.

As the temperature increases, does the rate of molecules 
escaping into the gas phase increase or decrease?

Vapor Pressure and Boiling Point
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the 
external pressure, acting on the liquid surface. At this temperature, the thermal energy of
