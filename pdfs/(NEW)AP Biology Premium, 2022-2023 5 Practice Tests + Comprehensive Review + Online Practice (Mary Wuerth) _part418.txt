5. The scientist has successfully created a plasmid that contains the DNA code for the human growth hormone
gene. Which technique should the scientist use to insert the plasmid into a cell?
(A) bacterial transformation

(C) gel electrophoresis
(D) polymerase chain reaction
Questions 6–8
Huntington’s disease is caused by a short tandem CAG repeat in the HTT gene. Individuals with fewer than 35 CAG
repeats in the HTT gene do not develop Huntington’s disease. Individuals with 40 or more CAG repeats will develop
Huntington’s disease.
6. Which of the following tools would be most useful in amplifying the number of copies of the HTT gene so that
more DNA would be available for analysis?
(A) CRISPR-Cas9
(B) gel electrophoresis
(C) polymerase chain reaction
(D) restriction enzymes
7. Which tool would be most useful for estimating the size of the HTT gene isolated?
(A) DNA ligase
(B) gel electrophoresis
(C) polymerase chain reaction
(D) restriction enzymes
