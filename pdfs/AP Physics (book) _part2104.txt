charges. One way of initiating the discharge of the capacitor
is by the use of a gas-filled tube which has an electrical breakdown when the 
voltage across it reaches a certain value 
After the discharge is finished, the
tube no longer conducts current and the recharging process repeats itself, starting
at a lower voltage 
Figure 19–23 shows a possible circuit, and the sawtooth
voltage it produces.
A simple blinking light can be an application of a sawtooth oscillator circuit.
Here the emf is supplied by a battery; the neon bulb flashes on at a rate of perhaps
1 cycle per second. The main component of a “flasher unit” is a moderately large
capacitor.

heart returns to its normal rhythm.
