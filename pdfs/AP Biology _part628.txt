th Curvularia grew
less than those without it, regardless of the temperature.
The illustration below presents xylem and phloem vessels in a stem
of a plant, with the direction of the flow of water and nutrients in the
vessels. Also shown are the values for water potential in various
cells (labeled A, B, C, and D).

What is the correct direction of flow from cell to cell based on the
water potential values in each area?
A → B; C → D
B → A; D → C
A → B; D → C
B → A; C → D
Compared with a cell that has few aquaporins in its membranes, a
cell that contains many aquaporins will have a
higher water potential
lower water potential
faster rate of active transport
faster rate of osmosis
Compared to seedlings grown without mycorrhizae, seedlings grown
with mycorrhizae will
grow taller because mycorrhizae are hormones that stimulate
growth
