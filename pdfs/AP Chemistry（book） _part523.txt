mula of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), 
one of the most common pain relievers, is C9H8O4. How 
many moles of C9H8O4 are in a 0.500-g tablet of aspirin? 
Assume the tablet is composed entirely of aspirin. (b) How 
many molecules of C9H8O4 are in this tablet? (c) How many 
carbon atoms are in the tablet?
 3.91 Very small semiconductor crystals, composed of approx-
imately 1000 to 10,000 atoms, are called quantum dots. 
Quantum dots made of the semiconductor CdSe are now be-
ing used in electronic reader and tablet displays because they 
emit light efficiently and in multiple colors, depending on 
dot size. The density of CdSe is 5.82 g/cm3.
(a) What is the mass of one 2.5-nm CdSe quantum dot? 
(b) CdSe quantum dots that are 2.5 nm in diameter emit 
blue light upon stimulation. Assuming that the dot is a 
perfect sphere and that the empty space in the dot can 
be neglected, calculate how many Cd atoms are in one 
quantum dot of this size.   
(c) What is the mass of one 6.5-nm CdSe quantu
