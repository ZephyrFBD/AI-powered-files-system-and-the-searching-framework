adi-
ene or pentatriene, we know that the five-carbon chain contains 
only one carbon–carbon double bond. Thus, we begin by placing 
the double bond in various locations along the chain, remember-
ing that the chain can be numbered from either end. After finding 
the different unique locations for the double bond, we consider 
whether the molecule can have cis and trans isomers.

SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 24.3 
Drawing Isomers
▶ Figure 24.8 Cis and trans isomers of 
alkenes. Geometric isomers of alkenes exist 
because rotation about a carbon–carbon 
double bond requires too much energy to 
occur at ordinary temperatures.
Alkynes
Alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing one or more C ‚C bonds. The simplest alkyne is 
acetylene (C2H2, systematic name ethyne), a highly reactive molecule. When acetylene is burned in 
a stream of oxygen in
