strategies you’ve learned in this book. Approach the
exam strategically, actively, and confidently. (Note that you should
not take a full-length practice exam with fewer than 48 hours leȇ before
your real exam. Doing so will probably exhaust you and hurt your score.)
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE EXAM
Go over the results of your latest practice exam. Don’t worry too much
about your score or whether you got a specific question right or wrong.
Instead, examine your overall performance on the diﬀerent topics,
choose a few of the topics where you struggled the most, and brush up
on them one final time.
Know exactly where you’re going to take the oﬀicial exam, how you’re
getting there, and how long it takes to get there. It’s probably a good idea
to visit your testing center sometime before the day of your exam so that
you know what to expect: what the rooms are like, how the desks are set
up, and so on.
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM
Do not study! You cannot cram for a test as extensive as the AP Exam.
