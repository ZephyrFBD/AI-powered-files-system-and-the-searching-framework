 Lysosomes, which
are involved in the breakdown of materials, and centrosomes, which play
a part in cell division, are not involved in the secretory pathway.
27. A
A positive feedback loop amplifies change (an increase in births leads to
more births or an increase in deaths leads to more deaths). The passenger
pigeons, therefore, experienced a positive feedback loop: a decrease in
population caused the mean fitness level of the pigeons to decrease,
which led to further population decrease, and so on. Thus, (A) is the
correct answer. Negative feedback counters change (an increase in births
limits population growth).
28. B
Cells that have damaged DNA in cells in G1 phase will activate a
checkpoint pathway that blocks or suppresses the activity of CDKs. While
the CDK inhibitors are active, the DNA can be repaired. The cell is unable
to progress to the next phase in the cell cycle, S phase, until the DNA is
repaired. (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because S phase, when the cellâ€™s
DNA is
