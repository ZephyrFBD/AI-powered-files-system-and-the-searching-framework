ctly 12 g of 12C. Thus, 12 g of 12C contains 1 mol of 
C atoms = 6.02 * 1023 C atoms. 
One mol of C2H2 contains 6.02 * 1023 C2H2 molecules. Because 
there are two C atoms in each molecule, this sample contains 
12.04 * 1023 C atoms. 
Because each CO2 molecule contains one C atom, the CO2 sample 
contains 9 * 1023 C atoms. 
Hence, the order is 12 g 12C 16 * 1023 C atoms2 6 9 * 1023 CO2 
molecules 19 * 1023 C atoms2 6 1 mol C2H2 112 * 1023 C atoms2.
Check We can check our results by comparing numbers of moles 
of C atoms in the samples because the number of moles is propor-
tional to the number of atoms. Thus, 12 g of 12C is 1 mol C, 1 mol 
of C2H2 contains 2 mol C, and 9 * 1023 molecules of CO2 contain 
1.5 mol C, giving the same order as stated previously.
*Avogadro’s number is also referred to as the Avogadro constant. The latter term is the name 
 
adopted by agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), but 
 
Avogadro’s number remains in widespread usa
