aperture have to be in order to obtain an image that resolved
this star–planet system? Assume the light emitted by the
star and planet has a wavelength of 550 nm.
57. (II) If you could shine a very powerful flashlight beam
toward the Moon, estimate the diameter of the beam when
it reaches the Moon. Assume that the beam leaves the
flashlight through a 5.0-cm aperture, that its white light has
an average wavelength of 550 nm, and that the beam
spreads due to diffraction only.

of 50.0 mm. Its aperture diameter varies from a maximum
of 25 mm (
