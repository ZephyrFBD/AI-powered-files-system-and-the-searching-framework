spatial relationship between
members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time. In other words, they show whether members of the
species live close together or far apart, and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart.
Individuals in a population can be more or less equally spaced apart, dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern, or
clustered in groups. These are known as uniform, random, and clumped dispersion patterns, respectively (Figure 36.5).
Uniform dispersion is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the
release of toxic chemicals by the sage plant Salvia leucophylla, a phenomenon called allelopathy) and in animals like the
penguin that maintain a defined territory. An example of random dispersion occurs with dandelion and other plants that
have wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen to fall in a favorable environment. A clumped dispersion
may be seen in plants that dr
