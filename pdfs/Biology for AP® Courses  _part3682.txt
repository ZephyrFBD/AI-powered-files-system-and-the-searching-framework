 prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the
heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two
other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood
to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs.
Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on
earth.
In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure
31.4d. The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation
and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and
mammals evolved independently from a three-chambe
