FIGURE 19–20 After the switch S
closes in the RC circuit shown in (a),
the voltage 
across the capacitor
increases with time as shown in (b),
and the current through the resistor
decreases with time as shown in (c).

Note that e is the inverse opera-
tion to the natural logarithm
and lnAexB = x.
