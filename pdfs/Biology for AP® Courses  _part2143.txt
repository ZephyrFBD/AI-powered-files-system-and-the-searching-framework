in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of
the allele. Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers
will mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. While it
is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate
the allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool. However, if a
family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating
and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression.
Changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural
selection, there are other evolutionary forces that could b
