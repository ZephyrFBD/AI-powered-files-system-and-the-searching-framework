t it now contains fifty percent 14N. In
subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only. This data supports the semi-conservative
replication model. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
The E. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were
harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. Some cells were
allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14N and spun again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is
loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000
rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in 15N will
band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in
14N after they had been shifted from 15N, the single b
