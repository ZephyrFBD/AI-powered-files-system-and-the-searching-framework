Furthermore, since

NOTE
is less than mg: the table does not push against the full weight of the
box because part of the pull exerted by the person is in the upward direction.
EXERCISE F A 10.0-kg box is dragged on a horizontal frictionless surface by a hori-
zontal force of 10.0 N. If the applied force is doubled, the normal force on the box will
(a) increase; (b) remain the same; (c) decrease.
Tension in a Flexible Cord
When a flexible cord pulls on an object, the cord is said to be under tension, and the
force it exerts on the object is the tension 
If the cord has negligible mass, the
force exerted at one end is transmitted undiminished to each adjacent piece of cord
along the entire length to the other end. Why? Because
for the
cord if the cord’
