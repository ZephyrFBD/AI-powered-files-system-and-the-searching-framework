g.28–22, or to mold the cornea of the eye (by vaporizing
tiny bits of material) to correct myopia and other eye defects (LASIK surgery). The
laser beam can be carried by an optical fiber (Section 23–6) to the surgical point,
sometimes as an additional fiber-optic path on an endoscope (again Section 23–6).
An example is the removal of plaque clogging human arteries. Lasers have been used
to destroy tiny organelles within a living cell by researchers studying how the
absence of that organelle affects the behavior of the cell. Laser beams are used 
to destroy cancerous and precancerous cells; and the heat seals off capillaries 
and lymph vessels, thus “cauterizing” the wound to prevent spread of the disease.
The intense heat produced in a small area by a laser beam is used for welding and
machining metals and for drilling tiny holes in hard materials. Because a laser beam is
coherent, monochromatic, narrow, and essentially parallel, lenses can be used to focus
the light into even smaller
