 four haploid cells are produced.
Gametogenesis
Meiosis is also known as gametogenesis. If sperm cells are produced, then meiosis is called spermatogenesis.
During spermatogenesis, four sperm cells are produced for each diploid cell. If an egg cell or an ovum is produced,
this process is called oogenesis.
Oogenesis is a little different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis produces only one ovum, not four. The other three
cells, called polar bodies, get only a tiny amount of cytoplasm and eventually degenerate. Why does oogenesis
produce only one ovum? Because the female wants to conserve as much cytoplasm as possible for the surviving
gamete, the ovum.
Here’s a summary of the major differences between mitosis and meiosis.
MITOSIS
MEIOSIS
Occurs in somatic (body) cells
Produces identical cells
Diploid cell → diploid cells
1 cell becomes 2 cells
Number of divisions: 1
Occurs in germ (sex) cells
Produces gametes
Diploid cell → haploid cells
1 cell becomes 4 cells
Number of divisions: 2
