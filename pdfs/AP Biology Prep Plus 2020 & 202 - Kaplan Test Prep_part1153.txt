replicated, follows G1. (C) and (D) are incorrect because mitosis
follows G2.
29. C
Cells normally show density-dependent inhibition, meaning that when
cells become crowded (e.g., more than a single layer in a culture dish),
they stop dividing. Normal cells will also stop dividing if they are not
attached to substrate, either the culture dish or extracellular tissue matrix
(anchorage dependence). (C) is thus correct. The other answer choices are
true statements but do not address the reason why clumping or
overlapping cells are abnormal.
30. B
According to the chart, Group 1 and Group 2 lemurs interpret the same
sounds diï¬€erently. Only (B) presents a situation where the lemur from
Group 2 would not be aware of incoming danger, instead interpreting a
warning of an incoming fox as a source of water being found. In (C) and
