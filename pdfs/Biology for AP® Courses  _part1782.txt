ature messenger RNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the length of time
the messenger RNA resides there before being degraded—a characteristic lifespan or “shelf-life” of the molecule called
RNA stability—can be altered to control the amount of protein that is synthesized. RNA stability is controlled by several
factors, including microRNAs (miRNA or RNAi, RNA interference); miRNAs always decrease stability and promote decay
of messenger RNA.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
