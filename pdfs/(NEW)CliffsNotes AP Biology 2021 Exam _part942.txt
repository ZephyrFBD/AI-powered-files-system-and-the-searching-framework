ng studied. Since the outgroup
lacks all three of the recorded traits, it branches from the tree first. Species III possesses only trait X, while species I
and II both possess trait X and Y. Therefore, species I and II, but not species III, are descendents of a common
ancestor possessing trait Y Finally, species I and species II differ by the absence/presence of trait Z. Two ways of
representing this tree are shown below.
14. A. Since species I and II share the most traits, they
are the most closely related.
15. B. The reaction is in equilibrium because the concentrations of reactants and product are such that the rate of the
forward reaction (formation of product C) equals that of the reverse reaction (formation of A and B from C), and the
net production of C (or A and B) is zero. By decreasing C, the forward reaction will again exceed that of the reverse
reaction, producing more C, until equilibrium is reached again. Adding more enzyme would only help if there were
a considerable exc
