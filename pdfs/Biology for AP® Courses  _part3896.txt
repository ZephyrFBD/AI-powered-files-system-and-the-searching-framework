 mobilize, identify the nature of the
pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat the infection, and then halt the immune response after
the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. Because of its programmable memory system, the immune
system can remember pathogens and initiate a more rapid response upon re-exposure. The immune response can be either
innate or adaptive. The adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific
defense. The innate immune response is always present and defends against all pathogens.
Despite the barriers of skin, tears, and mucus, pathogens may still enter the body. The innate immune system responds with
inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins. Several types of cells are involved in
the innate immune system, including mast cells that release histamines (causing those annoying symptoms associated with
allergies and colds), macrophage
