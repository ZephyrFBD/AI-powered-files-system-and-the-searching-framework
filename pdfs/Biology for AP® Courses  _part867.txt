 transport
chain?
a.
A hydrogen ion gradient across the membrane establishes a concentration gradient and not an electrical
gradient, thus assisting during the electron transport chain.
b.
A hydrogen ion gradient is established by pumping two hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix
in the intermembrane space. Its uneven distribution across the membrane establishes both concentration and
electrical gradients.
c.
A hydrogen ion gradient is established by pumping four hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix
into the intermembrane space and its uneven distribution across the membrane establishes concentration and
electrical gradients.
d.
Hydrogen ions are present in the intermembrane space from the beginning and results in the formation of
gradients necessary for the function of ATP synthase.
