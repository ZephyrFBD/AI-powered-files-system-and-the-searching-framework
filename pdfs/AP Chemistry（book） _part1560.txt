manometer (Figure 10.3), and a meter stick is used to measure the height of the 
mercury in the two arms of the U tube. The height of the mercury in the open-ended 
arm is 136.4 mm, and the height in the arm in contact with the gas in the flask is 
103.8 mm. What is the pressure of the gas in the flask (a) in atmospheres, (b) in 
kilopascals?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the atmospheric pressure 1764.7 torr2 and 
the mercury heights in the two arms of the manometer and asked 
to determine the gas pressure in the flask. Recall that millimeters 
of mercury is a pressure unit. We know that the gas pressure from 
the flask must be greater than atmospheric pressure because the 
mercury level in the arm on the flask side 1103.8 mm2 is lower 
than the level in the arm open to the atmosphere 1136.4 mm2. 
Therefore, the gas from the flask is pushing mercury from the arm 
in contact with the flask into the arm open to the atmosphere.
