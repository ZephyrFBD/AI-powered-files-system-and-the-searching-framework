 species would result in inbreeding
depression, as crop varieties must be bred with
wild species to remain viable.
b.
Loss of biodiversity reduces large-scale
monocultures but reinforces genetic
homogeneity contributing in the loss of crop
diversity.
c.
Loss of wild species would result in an increase
of intraspecific diversity within the different
crop varieties, but decrease in interspecific crop
diversity.
d.
Loss of wild species would reduce the genetic
variations as genes from wild relatives are
brought into crop varieties to add valued
characteristics to crops.
34. Predict the consequences of the bee colony collapse
disorder in a state such as California, which is a large
supplier of produce.
a.
Only pharmaceutical manufacturing and
industries involved in honey production are
going to be affected due to this disorder.
b.
Other pollinators would replace the bees in the
ecosystem and there would probably not be a
major impact on the production of produce.
c.
Lack of pollinators wou
