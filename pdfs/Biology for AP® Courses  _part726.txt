 bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules, either
temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Two types of helper
molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their
respective enzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (Fe++) and magnesium (Mg++). One example of an enzyme
that requires a metal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules, DNA polymerase, which requires a bound
zinc ion (Zn++) to function. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and

hydrogen, which are required for enzyme action. The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins (Figure
6.20). Some vitamins are precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a coenzyme for
multiple enzymes that take part in building the important connective tissue component, collage
