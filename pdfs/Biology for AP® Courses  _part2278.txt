What does the Eukaryote-first hypothesis suggest?
a.
that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host which acquired a nucleus to become the first
eukaryotic cell
b.
that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first followed by fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that
became mitochondria
c.
that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity
d.
that eukaryotes developed Golgi before mitochondria
Genome Fusion and the Evolution of Eukaryotes
Scientists believe the ultimate in HGT occurs through genome fusion between different species of prokaryotes when two
symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic. This occurs when one species is taken inside the cytoplasm of another species,
which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host. This mechanism is an
aspect of the Endosymbiont Theory, which is acc
