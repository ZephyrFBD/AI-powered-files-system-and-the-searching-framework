 size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. When there is
insufficient surface area to support a cellâ€™s increasing volume, a cell will either divide or die. The cell on the left
has a volume of 1 mm3 and a surface area of 6 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 6 to 1, whereas the
cell on the right has a volume of 8 mm3 and a surface area of 24 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 3 to
1.
On average, prokaryotic cells are smaller than eukaryotic cells. What are some advantages to small cell size? What are
some advantages to large cell size?
a.
Small, prokaryotic cells do not expend energy in intracellular transport of substances. Larger eukaryotic cells
have organelles, which enable them to produce complex substances.
b.
Small, prokaryotic cells easily escape the spontaneous changes in environmental conditions. Large,
eukaryotic cells have complex mechanisms to cope with such changes.
c.
Small, prokaryotic cells divide at a higher rate. Large, eukaryotic cells show
