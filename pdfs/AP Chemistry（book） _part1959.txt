Note that all atoms originally present in acetylene end up in 
the polyacetylene product.
(c) We can use the ideal-gas equation as follows:
 
PV = nRT
Acetylene has a molar mass of 26.0 g>mol; therefore, the mass 
of 0.204 mol is:
10.204 mol2126.0 g>mol2 = 5.32 g acetylene 
Note that from the answer to part (b), all the atoms in acet-
ylene go into polyacetylene. Due to conservation of mass, 
then, the mass of polyacetylene produced must also be 5.32 g, 
if we assume 100% yield.
(c) Acetylene is a gas at room temperature and pressure (298 K, 1.00 atm). How many grams of polyacetylene can you make 
from a 5.00-L vessel of acetylene gas at room temperature and room pressure? Assume that acetylene behaves ideally and 
that the polymerization reaction occurs with 100% yield.
(d) Using the average bond enthalpies in Table 8.4, predict whether the formation of polyacetylene from acetylene is endother-
mic or exothermic.
