Use models like pipe cleaners, beads, or “sockosomes” to learn about the
stages of mitosis. Be able to answer the following questions:
How does a chromosome replicate itself?
Why do chromosomes condense before the nucleus divides?
What happens if sister chromatids fail to separate properly?
Can chemicals in the environment alter the process of mitosis in
plants or animals? How would you design an experiment to prove
your answer?
Part 2
Prepare a chromosome squash from an onion root tip. See Figure 19.18.
Count the cells in interphase and the cells in mitosis. Analyze the data.
Collect the class data for each group. Calculate the mean and standard
deviation for each group.
Carry out an experiment comparing an onion root that has been treated
with a chemical that alters the rate of mitosis with one that has not been
treated. Complete a chi-square analys
