 the union of two sex cells from two individual organisms. If these two cells each contain
one set of chromosomes, the resulting fertilized cell contains two sets of chromosomes. Haploid cells contain one set of
chromosomes. Cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid. The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell
is called its ploidy level. If the reproductive cycle is to continue, a diploid cell must reduce the number of its chromosome
sets before fertilization can occur again. Otherwise, the number of chromosome sets would double, and continue to double
in every generation. So, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division that reduces the number
of chromosome sets.
Most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes. In an organism’s somatic cells, sometimes
referred to as “body” cells (all cells of a multicellular organism except the reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two
copies of each chromosome, called hom
