neurons is an example of exocytosis.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big
Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The learning objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
Big Idea 2
Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
