 Make sure each line or bar on your graph is easily identifiable by the reader. 
Axes must be clearly labeled with units. 
•  The x-axis shows the independent variable. Time is an example of an independent 
variable. Other possibilities for an independent variable might be light intensity, or 
the concentration of a hormone or nutrient. 
•  The y-axis denotes the dependent variable, or what is being affected by the condition 
(independent variable) shown on the x-axis. 
•  Intervals must be uniform. For example, if one square on the x-axis equals  
five minutes, each interval must be the same and not change to ten minutes or  
one minute. If there is a break in the graph, such as a time course over which  
little happens for an extended period, note this with a break in the axis and a  
corresponding break in the data line.  
•  For clarity, you do not have to label each interval. You can label every five or ten 
intervals, or whatever is appropriate. 
•  Label the x-axis and y-axis so
