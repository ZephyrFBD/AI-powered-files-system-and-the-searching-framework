reflects at the center of the mirror and can also be used to find an image point.

Light: Geometric Optics
The ray 
obeys the law of reflection, so the two right triangles 
and
are similar. Therefore, we have
For the other ray shown,
the triangles 
and AFB are also similar
because the angles at F are equal and we use the approximation

small compared to its radius). Furthermore 
the focal length of the
mirror, so
The left sides of the two preceding expressions are the same, so we can equate
the right sides:
We now divide both sides by 
and rearrange to obtain
(23;2)
This is the equation we were seeking. It is called the mirror equation and relates
the object and image distances to the focal length f (where
).
The mirror equation also holds for a plane
