Always use a consistent set of units
All other quantities can be defined in terms of these seven base quantities,† and
hence are referred to as derived quantities. An example of a derived quantity is
speed, which is defined as distance divided by the time it takes to travel that
distance. A Table inside the front cover lists many derived quantities and their
units in terms of base units. To define any quantity, whether base or derived,
we can specify a rule or procedure, and this is called an operational definit
