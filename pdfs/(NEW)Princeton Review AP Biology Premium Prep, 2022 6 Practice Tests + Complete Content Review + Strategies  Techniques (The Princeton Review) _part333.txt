es can be added only to the 3’ end of the growing
chain. However, when the double-helix is “unzipped,” one of the two strands is oriented in the opposite direction—
3’ to 5’. Because DNA polymerase doesn’t work in this direction, the strand needs to be built in pieces. You can see
in the figure below that the leading strand is being created toward the opening of the helix and the helix continually
opens ahead of it to accommodate it. The lagging strand is built in the opposite direction of the way the helix is
opening, so it can build only until it hits a previously built stretch. Once the helix unwinds a bit more, it can build
another Okazaki fragment, and so on. These fragments are eventually linked together by the enzyme DNA ligase to
produce a continuous strand. Finally, hydrogen bonds form between the new base pairs, leaving two identical copies
of the original DNA molecule.
When DNA is replicated, we don’t end up with two entirely new molecules. Each new molecule has half of the
