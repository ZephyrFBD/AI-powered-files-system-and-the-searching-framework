he highest root-mean-square mo-
lecular speed at a given temperature? (d) Which one has 
the highest total molecular volume relative to the space 
occupied by the gas? (e) Which has the highest aver-
age kinetic-molecular energy? (f) Which one would ef-
fuse more rapidly than N2? (g) Which one would have 
 
the largest van der Waals b parameter?

Does the effect of intermolecular attraction on the prop-
erties of a gas become more significant or less significant if 
(a) the gas is compressed to a smaller volume at constant 
temperature; (b) the temperature of the gas is increased at 
constant volume?

Which of the noble gases other than radon would you ex-
pect to depart most readily from ideal behavior? Use the 
density data in Table 7.8 to show evidence in support of 
your answer.

It turns out that the van der Waals constant b equals four 
times the total volume actually occupied by the molecules 
of a mole of gas. Using this f
