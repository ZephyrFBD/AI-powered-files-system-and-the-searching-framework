Nobel Prize-winning biologist Stanley Prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists
that such agents do indeed exist.
Fatal neurodegenerative diseases, such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle
(commonly known as “mad cow disease”) were shown to be transmitted by prions. The disease was spread by the
consumption of meat, nervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species. Kuru, native to humans in
Papua New Guinea, was spread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism. BSE, originally detected in the United
Kingdom, was spread between cattle by the practice of including cattle nervous tissue in feed for other cattle. Individuals
with kuru and BSE show symptoms of loss of motor control and unusual behaviors, such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter
with kuru, followed by death. Kuru was controlled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism.
On the other hand, BSE was initially thought to only affect cat
