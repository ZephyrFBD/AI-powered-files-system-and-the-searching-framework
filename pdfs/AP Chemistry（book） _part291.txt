2.5 ∣ The Periodic Table
As the list of known elements expanded during the early 1800s, attempts were made to 
find patterns in chemical behavior. These efforts culminated in the development of the 
periodic table in 1869. We will have much to say about the periodic table in later chap-
ters, but it is so important and useful that you should become acquainted with it now. 
You will quickly learn that the periodic table is the most significant tool that chemists use for 
organizing and remembering chemical facts.
Many elements show strong similarities to one another. The elements lithium (Li), 
sodium (Na), and potassium (K) are all soft, very reactive metals, for example. The ele-
ments helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) are all nonreactive gases. If the elements 
are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, their chemical and physical prop-
erties
