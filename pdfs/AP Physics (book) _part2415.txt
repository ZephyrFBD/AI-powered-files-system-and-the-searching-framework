24. (I) A motor has an armature resistance of 
If it draws
8.20 A when running at full speed and connected to a 120-V
line, how large is the back emf?
25. (I) The back emf in a motor is 72 V when operating at
1800 rpm. What would be the back emf at 2300 rpm if the
magnetic field is unchanged?
26. (II) What will be the current in the motor of Example 21–8
if the load causes it to run at half speed?

27. (I) A transformer is designed to change 117 V into
13,500 V, and there are 148 turns in the primary coil. How
many turns are in the secondary coil?
28. (I) A transformer has 360 turns in the primary coil and 120
in the secondary coil. What kind of transformer is this, and
by what factor does it change the voltage? By what factor
does it change the current?
