accharide names end with the
suffix -ose. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure R-CHO), it is known as an aldose,
and if it has a ketone group (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R'), it is known as a ketose. Depending on the
number of carbons in the sugar, they also may be known as trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and or hexoses
(six carbons). See Figure 3.5 for an illustration of the monosaccharides.

Figure 3.5 Monosaccharides are classified based on the position of their carbonyl group and the number of carbons
in the backbone. Aldoses have a carbonyl group (indicated in green) at the end of the carbon chain, and ketoses have
a carbonyl group in the middle of the carbon chain. Trioses, pentoses, and hexoses have three-, five-, and six-carbon
backbones, respectively.
The chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6. In humans, glucose is an important source of energy. During cellular
