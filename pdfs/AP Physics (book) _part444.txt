77. In the design of a supermarket, there are to be several ramps
connecting different parts of the store. Customers will have
to push grocery carts up the ramps and it is desirable that
this not be too difficult. The engineer has done a survey and
found that almost no one complains if the force required 
is no more than 18 N. Ignoring friction, at what maximum
angle should the ramps be built, assuming a full 25-kg cart?
78. A jet aircraft is accelerating at 
as it climbs at an
angle of 18° above the horizontal (Fig. 4–67). What is the
total force that the cockpit seat
