 as in diagram III, because predators were selecting those  
light-colored beetles that were distinguishable on the darker tree trunks. 
(D)
This option is correct because it illustrates the change in the population that 
would occur with selection against the lighter colored beetles. The student is 
asked to justify and explain the process of biological evolution in this question. 
A change in coloration of the beetle population after pollution is shown in 
diagram IV because the original beetles (lighter colored beetles) were eaten by 
predators, and the darker colored beetles would have survived.
