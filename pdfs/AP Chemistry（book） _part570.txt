he greater the num-

SOLUTION
Analyze We are given several chemical formulas and asked to clas-
sify each substance as a strong electrolyte, weak electrolyte, or 
nonelectrolyte.
Plan The approach we take is outlined in Table 4.3. We can predict 
whether a substance is ionic or molecular based on its composi-
tion. As we saw in Section 2.7, most ionic compounds we encoun-
ter in this text are composed of a metal and a nonmetal, whereas 
most molecular compounds are composed only of nonmetals.
Solve Two compounds fit the criteria for ionic compounds: CaCl2 
and KOH. Because Table 4.3 tells us that all ionic compounds are 
strong electrolytes, that is how we classify these two substances. 
The three remaining compounds are molecular. Two of these 
molecular substances, HNO3 and HCOOH, are acids. Nitric acid, 
HNO3, is a common strong acid, as shown in Table 4.2, and there-
fore is a strong electrolyte. Because most acids are weak acid
