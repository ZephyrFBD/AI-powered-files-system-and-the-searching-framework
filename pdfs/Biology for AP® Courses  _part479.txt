centrioles, flagella, and cilia.
4.6 | Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the components of the extracellular matrix?
•
What are the roles of tight junctions, gap junctions, and plasmodesmata in allowing cells to exchange materials
with the environment and communicate with other cells?
Connection for AP® Courses
With the exception of gap junctions between animal cells and plasmodesmata between plant cells that facilitate the exchange
of substances, the information presented in Section 4.6| Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities is not required
for AP®. Concepts about cell communication and signaling processes that are required for AP®, including the features of
cells that make communication possible, are covered in Chapter 9.
You already know that a group of similar cells working together is called a tissue. As you might expect that, if cells are to
work together, they must communicate with
