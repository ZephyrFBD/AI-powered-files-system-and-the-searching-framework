s, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system. However, in
the rabbit the small intestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material. The enlarged organ
provides more surface area for absorption of nutrients. Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes
through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it passes through the anus as soft feces called
cecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.
Avian
Birds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. They do not have teeth and so their digestive
system, shown in Figure 25.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that
reflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic
rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two cham
