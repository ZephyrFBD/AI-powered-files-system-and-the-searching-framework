ass, and temperature. The higher the molar mass and pressure, the denser the gas. 
The higher the temperature, the less dense the gas. Although gases form homogeneous 
An inflated balloon has a volume of 6.0 L at sea level (1.0 atm) and is allowed to ascend until the pressure is 0.45 atm. During 
ascent, the temperature of the gas falls from 22 °C to -21 °C. Calculate the volume of the balloon at its final altitude.
Sample Exercise 10.6 
Using the Combined Gas Law
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to determine a new volume for a gas sample 
when both pressure and temperature change.
Plan Let’s again proceed by converting temperatures to kelvins and 
tabulating our information.

Because n is constant, we can use Equation 10.8.
Solve Rearranging Equation 10.8 to solve for V2 gives
