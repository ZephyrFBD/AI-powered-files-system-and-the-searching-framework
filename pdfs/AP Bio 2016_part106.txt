2. The yellow-fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is a major vector of human disease. In a particular location in Africa, 
there are two forms of the mosquito. The forest form of the mosquito is black and often lays its eggs in tree holes 
and pools of water in the forest. The domestic form of the mosquito is brown and prefers to lay its eggs in 
rainwater collected near human dwellings. 
Researchers used a choice chamber (Figure 1) to investigate the host preference of A. aegypti. The researchers 
recorded the number of forest-form and domestic-form mosquitoes that bit human or guinea pig hosts during 
several ten-minute trials. The researchers used these data to calculate a host-preference index for each fo
