For most 
of the representative elements, the change in radius from the 
n = 2 to the n = 3 period is greater than the change in radius 
from n = 3 to n = 4. (iv) The radii of the transition elements 
generally increase moving from left to right within a period. 
(v) The large radii of the Group 1A elements are due to their 
relatively small effective nuclear charges.
 7.23  Estimate the As¬I bond length from the data in Figure 7.7 
and compare your value to the experimental As¬I bond 
length in arsenic triiodide, AsI3, 2.55 Å.
 7.24  The experimental Bi¬I bond length in bismuth triiodide, 
BiI3, is 2.81 Å. Based on this value and data in Figure 7.7, pre-
dict the atomic radius of Bi.
