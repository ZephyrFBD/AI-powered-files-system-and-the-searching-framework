ass of 235U in the sample 
described in part (a)? (c) Now suppose that the UF6 is dif-
fused through a porous barrier and that the change in the 
ratio of 238U and 235U in the diffused gas can be described 
by Equation 10.23. What is the mass of 235U in a sample of 
the diffused gas analogous to that in part (a)? (d) After one 
more cycle of gaseous diffusion, what is the percentage of 
235UF6 in the sample?
 21.90  A sample of an alpha emitter having an activity of 0.18 
Ci is stored in a 25.0-mL sealed container at 22 Â°C for 245 
days. (a) How many alpha particles are formed during this 
time? (b) Assuming that each alpha particle is converted to 
a helium atom, what is the partial pressure of helium gas in 
the container after this 245-day period?
 [21.91]  Charcoal samples from Stonehenge in England were 
burned in O2, and the resultant CO2 gas bubbled into a 
solution of Ca1OH22 (limewater), resulting in the precipi-
tation of CaCO3. The CaCO3 was removed by filtration and 
dried.
