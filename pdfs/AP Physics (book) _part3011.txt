heat).
APPROACH Let’s assume an average wavelength in the middle of the visible
spectrum,
The energy of each photon is 
Only
3% of the 100-W power is emitted as visible light, or 
The number
of photons emitted per second equals the light output of 
divided by 
the energy of each photon.
SOLUTION The energy emitted in one second 
is
where N is
the number of photons emitted per second and 
Hence
per second, or almost 
photons emitted per second, an enormous number.
