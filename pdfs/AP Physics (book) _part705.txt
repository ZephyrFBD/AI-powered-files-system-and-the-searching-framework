 sled. When she drops off, does 
the sled speed up, slow down, or keep the same speed?
RESPONSE (a) Because Susan falls vertically onto the sled, she has no initial
horizontal momentum. Thus the total horizontal momentum afterward equals the
momentum of the sled initially. Since the mass of the system
has
increased, the speed must decrease.
(b) At the instant Susan falls off, she is moving with the same horizontal speed
as she was while on the sled. At the moment she leaves the sled, she has the
same momentum she had an instant before. Because her momentum does not
change, neither does the sledâ€™s (total momentum conserved); the sled keeps the
same speed.
