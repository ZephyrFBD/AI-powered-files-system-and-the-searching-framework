 a bond, in kJ>mol, that can be broken 
by absorption of a photon of 420-nm light? (c) Write out the 
photodissociation reaction showing Lewis-dot structures.
 18.35  Consider the Earth’s energy balance shown in Figure 18.12. 
(a) How many different sources transfer energy to the 
atmosphere?  Which makes the largest contribution? What 
is the total amount of energy transferred into the atmo-
sphere in W/m2? (b) To maintain a balance the atmosphere 
must lose an equal amount of energy by emitting radiation, 
either into space or back toward the surface. What fraction 
is radiated back to the surface?
 18.36  The atmosphere of Mars is 96% CO2, with a pressure of 
approximately 6 * 10−3 atm at the surface. Based on mea-
surements taken over a period of several years by the Rover 
Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS), the average 
daytime temperature at the REMS location on Mars is 
 
–5.7 °C (22 °F), while the average nighttime temperature 
is –79 °C (–109 °F). This daily variation in
