where 
is the work done by nonconservative forces.
Power is defined as the rate at which work is done, or the
rate at which energy is transformed. The SI unit of power is 
the watt (1 W = 1 Js).

NC = ¢ke + ¢pe,
ke + pe = constant.
Summary
1. In what ways is the word “work” as used in everyday lan-
guage the same as it is defined in physics? In what ways is
it different? Give examples of both.
2. Can a centripetal force ever do work on an object?
Explain.
3. Why is it tiring to push hard against a solid wall even though
you are doing no work?
4. Can the normal force on an object ever do work? Explain.
5. You have two springs that are identical except that spring 1
is stiffer than spring 2 
On which spring is more
work done: (a) if they are stretched using the same force;
(b) if they are stretched the same distance?
6. If the speed of a particle triples, by what factor does its
kinetic energy increase?
7. List some everyday forces that are not conservative, and
