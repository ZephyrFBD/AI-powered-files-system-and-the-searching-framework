rn fruit will increase in number, while the flies that 
eat apples will decrease in number because of the use of insecticides on 
apple trees.
(B)	 The single fly species will evolve into two distinct species because of the lack 
of gene flow between the two populations.
(C)	 The ability to survive on a diet of two different fruits will help the flies learn 
to eat many more types of fruit.
(D)	The flies that eat hawthorn fruit will lay some of their eggs on the earlier-
ripening apples to minimize competition among the larvae.
Platelets are fragments of larger cells and normally circulate in the blood without 
adhering to blood vessel walls. When the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, collagen 
fibers in the wall are exposed to the interior of the blood vessel. The exposed fibers 
and chemicals released from the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel attract 
platelets, which start to form a plug and release other chemicals (Figure 1).
