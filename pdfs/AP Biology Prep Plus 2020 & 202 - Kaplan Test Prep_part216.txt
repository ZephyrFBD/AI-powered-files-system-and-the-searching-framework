relying on the administration of strictly-timed synthetic insulin. One idea
that has been proposed is genetically engineering bacteria to reprogram
cells in the intestine to secrete insulin in response to changing glucose
levels in the body. Another option is to engineer the bacteria to produce
insulin themselves, thereby simplifying the process.
To test the second idea, scientists perform a transformation procedure on
a culture of E. coli cells with a plasmid containing a gene coding for
insulin secretion. The plasmid also contains a gene (ampr) that confers
