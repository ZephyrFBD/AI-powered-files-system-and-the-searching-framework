he cells of the
stomach survive in such an acidic environment? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them?
The answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying. New stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead
ones, which are digested by the stomach acids. It is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced
every seven to ten days.

scale.
One of the risks for people with diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis, a build-up of acid in the blood stream. Explain why
this is dangerous to humans.
a.
Diabetic ketoacidosis decreases the normal pH (8.35-8.45) to a lower value.
b.
Diabetic ketoacidosis increases normal pH level of blood disrupting biological processes.
c.
Diabetic ket
