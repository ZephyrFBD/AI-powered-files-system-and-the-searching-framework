LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-3.F
Describe the relationship 
between ecosystem diversity 
and its resilience to changes 
in the environment.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-3.F.1
Natural and artificial ecosystems with fewer 
component parts and with little diversity 
among the parts are often less resilient to 
changes in the environment. 
SYI-3.F.2
Keystone species, producers, and essential 
abiotic and biotic factors contribute to 
maintaining the diversity of an ecosystem.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-3
Naturally occurring diversity among and between components within biological 
systems affects interactions with the environment.
TOPIC 8.6
Biodiversity
SYI-3.G
Explain how the addition or 
removal of any component of 
an ecosystem will affect its 
overall short-term and long-
term structure.
SYI-3.G.1
The diversity of species within an ecosystem 
may influence the organization of the 
ecosystem.
SYI-3.G.2
The effects of keystone species on the 
ecosystem are disproporti
