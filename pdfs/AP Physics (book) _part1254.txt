Find the maximum compression of the bumper
if the car, with mass 1300 kg, collides with a wall at a speed
of 
(approximately 
).
64. The length of a simple pendulum is 0.72 m, the pendulum
bob has a mass of 295 g, and it is released at an angle of 12°
to the vertical. Assume SHM. (a) With what frequency
does it oscillate? (b) What is the pendulum bob’s speed
when it passes through the lowest point of the swing?
(c) What is the total energy stored in this oscillation assum-
ing no losses?
65. A block of mass M is suspended from a ceiling by a spring
with spring stiffness constant k. A penny of mass m is
placed on top of the block. What is the maximum amplitude
of oscillations that will allow the penny to just stay on top
of the block? (Assume
)
66. A block with mass
rests on a frictionless table
and is attached by a horizontal spring
to a
wall. A second block, of mass
rests on top 
of M. The coefficient of static friction
