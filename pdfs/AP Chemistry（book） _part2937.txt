the two-step process is replaced by a one-step process in which toluene is reacted with 
methanol at 425 °C over a special catalyst:

The one-step process saves money both because toluene and methanol are less expensive 
than benzene and ethylene, and because the reaction requires less energy input. Addi-
tional benefits are that the methano
