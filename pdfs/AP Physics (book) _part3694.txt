At these extremely high temperatures, well above 
high-energy
collisions can cause the breaking apart of iron and nickel nuclei into He nuclei,
and eventually into protons and neutrons:
These are energy-requiring (endothermic) reactions, which rob energy from the
core, allowing gravitational contraction to begin. This then can force electrons
and protons together to form neutrons in inverse
decay:
As a result of these reactions, the pressure in the core drops precipitously. As the
core collapses under the huge gravitational forces, the tremendous mass becomes
essentially an enormous nucleus made up almost exclusively of neutrons.
