resentation are lost in these representations, 
this is not a serious disadvantage. For qualitative discussions, the most important fea-
tures of orbitals are shape and relative size, which are adequately displayed by contour 
representations.

How many maxima would you expect to find in the radial probability 
function for the 4s orbital of the hydrogen atom? How many nodes would 
you expect in this function?
