taxis. In most cases, the experiments done in the choice chamber will be chemotactic 
experiments, as indicated by the number of flies that collect on one end of the chamber 
or another in response to a chemical stimulus. At some point, students may wish 
to investigate if the chemotactic response is greater than a geotactic or phototactic

response. The flies could also exhibit a behavior that is not oriented toward or away from 
the stimulus; rather, the stimulus elicits a random response. Such behavior would be 
considered a kinesis. 
As students investigate the choices of fruit flies, it will be important for them to 
identify the ingredients in the household materials they are testing. Can they discover a 
pattern to the behavior of the flies? Are there substances that can attract fruit flies down 
in a vertically held chamber? If fruit flies
