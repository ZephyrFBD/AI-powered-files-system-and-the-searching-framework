Sound; Decibels
8. (I) What is the intensity of a sound at the pain level of
120 dB? Compare it to that of a whisper at 20 dB.
9. (I) What is the sound level of a sound whose intensity is
10. (II) You are trying to decide between two new stereo
amplifiers. One is rated at 75 W per channel and the other
is rated at 120 W per channel. In terms of dB, how much
louder will the more powerful amplifier be when both are
producing sound at their maximum levels?
11. (II) If two firecrackers produce a combined sound level of
85 dB when fired simultaneously at a certain place, what
will be the sound level if only one is exploded? [Hint: Add
intensities, not dBs.]
1.5 * 10â€“6 Wm2?
17. (II) If the amplitude of a sound wave is made 3.5 times
greater, (a) by what factor will the intensity increase? (b) By
how many dB will the sound level increase?
18. (II) Two sound waves have equal displacement amplitudes,
but one has 2.2 times the frequency of the other. What is
the ratio of their intensities?
