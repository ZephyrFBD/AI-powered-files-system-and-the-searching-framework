The empty can, which is
mainly a hoop plus a thin disk, has most of its mass concentrated at R; so it will 
be a bit faster than the pure hoop but slower than the D-cell. See Fig. 8–24.
NOTE The rolling objects do not even have to have the same radius: the speed
at the bottom does not depend on the object’s mass M or radius R, but only 
on the shape (and the height of the incline H).
