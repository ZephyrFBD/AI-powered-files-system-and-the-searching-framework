ing some of the results from the “Approach” above, we obtain
Solving for T we obtain
Method 2: “heat 
lost” produces a word equation like the one above
(the last plus sign becomes an equals sign and we lose the “
”). That is,
The term on the right is heat lost by 3.0 kg of water cooling from 20°C to T; here
for this approach. Algebraically, this equation is
identical to the one above in the first method.†
¢T = T
i - T
f = 20°C - T
= (3.0 kg)(4186 JkgC°)(20°C - T).
10,500 J + 167,000 J + (0.50 kg)(4186 JkgC°)(T - 0°C)
 0
gained = heat
T = 5.0°C.
+ (3.0 kg)(4186 JkgC°)(T - 20°C) = 0.
10,500 J + 167,000 J + (0.50 kg)(4186 JkgC°)(T - 0°C)
