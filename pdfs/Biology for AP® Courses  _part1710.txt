œÅ -independent termination of
transcription in prokaryotes.
a.
Rho-dependent termination is controlled by rho
protein and the polymerase stalls near the end of
the gene at a run of G nucleotides on the DNA
template. In rho-independent termination, when
the polymerase encounters a region rich in C-G
nucleotides the mRNA folds into a hairpin loop
that causes the polymerase to stall.
