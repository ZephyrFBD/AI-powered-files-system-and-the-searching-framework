 acid or when it falls directly to the Earth as fallout. Weathering of rocks also
makes sulfates available to terrestrial ecosystems. Decomposition of living organisms returns sulfates to the ocean,
soil and atmosphere. (credit: modification of work by John M. Evans and Howard Perlman, USGS)
On land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and
geothermal vents (Figure 37.22). Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and as rain falls through
the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfur can also fall directly from the
atmosphere in a process called fallout. Also, the weathering of sulfur-containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil. These
rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. Terrestrial
ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates ( SO4âˆ’), and upon the death and decomposition of
