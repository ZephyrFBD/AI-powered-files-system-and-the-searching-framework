ve in hot climates have evolved two different ways around this: CAM plants deal with this problem by
temporally separating carbon fixation and the Calvin cycle. They open their stomata at night and incorporate CO2
into organic acids. During the day, they close their stomata and release CO2 from the organic acids while the light
reactions run. In contrast, C4 plants have slightly different leaf anatomy that allows them to perform CO2 fixation in
a different part of the leaf from the rest of the Calvin cycle. This prevents photorespiration. C4 plants produce a four-
carbon molecule as the first product of carbon fixation and perform cyclic electron flow in the light reactions
(discussed on the previous page).
CELLULAR RESPIRATION
In the shorthand version, cellular respiration looks something like this:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP
Notice that we’ve taken a sugar, perhaps a molecule of glucose, and combined it with oxygen to produce carbon
dioxide, water, and energy in the form of ou
