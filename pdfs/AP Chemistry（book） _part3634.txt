, assuming complete reaction of one pound of ammo-
nium perchlorate.
 22.97 The dissolved oxygen present in any highly pressurized, 
high-temperature steam boiler can be extremely corrosive 
to its metal parts. Hydrazine, which is completely miscible 
with water, can be added to remove oxygen by reacting with 
it to form nitrogen and water. (a) Write the balanced equa-
tion for the reaction between gaseous hydrazine and oxygen. 
(b) Calculate the enthalpy change accompanying this reac-
tion. (c) Oxygen in air dissolves in water to the extent of 9.1 
ppm at 20 °C at sea level. How many grams of hydrazine are 
required to react with all the oxygen in 3.0 * 104 L (the vol-
ume of a small swimming pool) under these conditions?
 22.98  One method proposed for removing SO2 from the ﬂue gases 
of power plants involves reaction with aqueous H2S. Ele-
mental sulfur is the product. (a) Write a balanced chemical 
equation for the reaction. (b) What volume of H2S at 27 °C 
and 760 torr would be
