 is the rate at which producers acquire chemical energy through photosynthesis
before any of this energy is used for metabolism.
2. Net primary productivity (NPP) is the rate at which producers acquire chemical energy through photosynthesis
less the rate at which they consume energy through respiration.
3. Respiratory rate is the rate at which energy is consumed through respiration.
Part I: Estimating Net Primary Productivity
Net primary productivity for Wisconsin Fast Plants is evaluated at various intervals by weighing them. This provides
the mass of a live plant, which contains a considerable amount of water. Dry mass can be determined by weighing a
group of live plants, then drying them in an oven, and weighing the dry matter to determine the percent of dry matter
in the live plants. Chemical energy can be determined by multiplying biomass by 4.35 kcal/g. The net rate of
chemical energy gain can be determined by calculating the change in energy per day.
