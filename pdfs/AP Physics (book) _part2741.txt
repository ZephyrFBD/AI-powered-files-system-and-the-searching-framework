the angles at which there are diffraction minima for wave-
lengths of (a) 0.50 cm, (b) 1.0 cm, and (c) 3.0 cm.
27. (II) (a) For a given wavelength 
what is the minimum slit
width for which there will be no diffraction minima?
(b) What is the minimum slit width so that no visible light
exhibits a diffraction minimum?
28. (II) Light of wavelength 620 nm falls on a slit that is
wide. Estimate how far the first bright 
diffraction fringe is from the strong central maximum if the
screen is 10.0 m away.

29. (II) Monochromatic light of wavelength 633 nm falls on a
slit. If the angle between the first two bright fringes on either
side of the central maximum is 32°, estimate the slit width.
