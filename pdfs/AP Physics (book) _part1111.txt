22. (II) An open-tube mercury manometer is used to measure
the pressure in an oxygen tank. When the atmospheric
pressure is 1040 mbar, what is the absolute pressure (in Pa)
in the tank if the height of the mercury in the open tube is
(a) 18.5 cm higher, (b) 5.6 cm lower, than the mercury in
the tube connected to the tank? See Fig. 10–7a.
