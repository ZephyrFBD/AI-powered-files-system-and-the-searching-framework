levels are specified on a logarithmic scale. The sound level
specified in decibels, is defined in terms of intensity I as
(12;1)
where the reference intensity 
is usually taken to be
Musical instruments are simple sources of sound in which
standing waves are produced.
The strings of a stringed instrument may vibrate as a
whole with nodes only at the ends; the frequency at which this
standing wave occurs is called the fundamental. The funda-
mental frequency corresponds to a wavelength equal to twice
the length of the string,
The string can also vibrate at
higher frequencies, called overtones or harmonics, in which

there are one or more additional nodes. The frequency of each
harmonic is a whole-number multiple of the fundamental.
In wind instruments, standing waves are set up in the col-
umn of air within the tube.
The vibrating air in an open tube (open at both ends) has
