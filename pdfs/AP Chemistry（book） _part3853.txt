ditions, the aldehyde may be isolated as the first product of oxidation, as in the sequence

where (O) represents any oxidant that can provide oxygen atoms. The air oxidation 
of ethanol to acetic acid is responsible for causing wines to turn sour, producing 
vinegar.
The oxidation processes in organic compounds are related to those oxidation reac-
tions we studied in Chapter 20. Instead of counting electrons, the number of C ¬O 
bonds is usually considered to show the extent of oxidation of similar compounds. For 
example, methane can be oxidized to methanol, then formaldehye (methanal), then for-
mic acid (methanoic acid):
