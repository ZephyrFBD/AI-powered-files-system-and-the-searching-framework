A. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are
bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm.
The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5′ carbon end of one strand will face the 3′ carbon
end of its matching strand. (This is referred to as antiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many
nucleic acid interactions.)
Figure 3.34 Native DNA is an antiparallel double helix. The phosphate backbone (indicated by the curvy lines) is on
the outside, and the bases are on the inside. Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base
from the opposing strand. (credit: Jerome Walker/Dennis Myts)
Only certain types of base pairing are allowed. For example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. This
means A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in Figure 3.35
