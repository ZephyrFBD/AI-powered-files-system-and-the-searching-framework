e (connected to a battery), and
its magnitude depends on that device’s resistance. The resistance is a property of
the wire or device. The voltage, on the other hand, is external to the wire or device,
and is applied across the two ends of the wire or device. The current through the
device might be called the “response”: the current increases if the voltage increases
or the resistance decreases, as I = VR.

EXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 501, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Current is not a vector, even though current does have a direction. In a thin
wire, the direction of the current is always parallel to the wire at each point, no
matter how the wire curves, just like water in a pipe. The direction of conven-
tional (positive) current is from high potential 
toward lower potential 
Current and charge do not increase or decrease or get “used up” when going
through a wire
