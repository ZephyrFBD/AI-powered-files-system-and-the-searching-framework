and
right of the energy equation. Let us write the energy equation for points 1 and 3 in
Fig. 6–23. Point 1 is the initial point just before the ball starts to fall (Fig. 6–23a),
so  
and  
Point 3 is when the spring is fully compressed
(Fig. 6–23c), so  
The forces on the ball in this
process are gravity and (at least part of the time) the spring. So conservation of
energy tells us
where we have set
for the spring at point 1 because it is not acting and is
not compressed or stretched. We solve for k:
just as in our first method of solution.

Dissipative Forces: Solving Problems
In our applications of energy conservation in Section 6–7, we neglected friction
and other nonconservative forces. But in many situations they c
