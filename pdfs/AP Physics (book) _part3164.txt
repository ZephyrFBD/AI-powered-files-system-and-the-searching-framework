ot attracted nor are electrons readily lost (ionization
energy is high). This is why the noble gases are chemically inert (more on this
when we discuss molecules and bonding in Chapter 29). Column VII contains the
halogens, which lack one electron from a filled shell. Because of the shapes of
the orbits (see Section 29â€“1), an additional electron can be accepted from
another atom, and hence these elements are quite reactive. They have a valence
of 
meaning that when an extra electron is acquired, the resulting ion has a
net charge of 
Column I of the Periodic Table contains the alkali metals, all
of which have a single outer s electron. This electron spends most of its time
outside the inner closed shells and subshells which shield it from most of the
nuclear charge. Indeed, it is relatively far from the nucleus and is attracted to it
by a net charge of only about 
because of the shielding effect of the other
electrons. Hence this outer electron is easily removed and can spend much of i
