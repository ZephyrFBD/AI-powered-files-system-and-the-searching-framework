ctivity of an
enzyme
inorganic ion, such as iron and magnesium ions, required for optimal regulation of enzyme activity
type of inhibition in which the inhibitor competes with the substrate molecule by binding to the
active site of the enzyme
process that changes the natural properties of a substance
describes chemical reactions that require energy input
total energy of a system
measure of randomness or disorder within a system
describes chemical reactions that release free energy
effect of a product of a reaction sequence to decrease its further production by inhibiting the activity
of the first enzyme in the pathway that produces it
Gibbs free energy is the usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.
energy energy transferred from one system to another that is not work (energy of the motion of molecules or particles)
total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction
dynamic fit between the enzyme and its substrate, in which both components modify their stru
