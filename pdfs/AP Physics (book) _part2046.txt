ical copper wire used for home
wiring in the U.S. has a diameter of 1.63 mm. What is the
resistance of 125 m of this wire? (c) What would be the
resistance of the same wire if it were made of aluminum?
(d) How much power would be dissipated in each wire if it
carried 18 A of current? (e) What should be the diameter
of the aluminum wire for it to have the same resistance 
as the copper wire? (f) In Section 18–4, a statement is
made about the resistance of copper and aluminum wires 
of the same weight. Using Table 10–1 for the densities of
copper and aluminum, find the resistance of an aluminum
wire of the same mass and length as the copper wire in 
part (b). Is the statement true?
*7. How far can an average electron move along the wires of a
650-W toaster during an alternating current cycle? The
power cord has copper wires of diameter 1.7 mm and is
plugged into a standard 60-Hz 120-V ac outlet. [Hint: The
maximum current in the cycle is related to the maximum
drift velocity. The maximum
