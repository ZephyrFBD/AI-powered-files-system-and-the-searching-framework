 of the hydroxide at carbon 2
produce water molecules in an aqueous solution where
hydrogen ions are abundant.
DNA is a polymer formed from a chain with repeated
2-deoxyribose, 5-phosphate molecules.
C. Create a visual representation of three 2-deoxyribose,
5-phosphate molecules forming a chain in which an
oxygen atom in the phosphate that is attached to the
5-carbon replaces the OH on the 3-carbon of the next
ribose sugar.
76. Cells are bounded by membranes composed of
phospholipids. A phospholipid consists of a pair of fatty
acids that may or may not have carbon-carbon double
bonds, fused at the carboxylic acid with a three-carbon
glycerol that is terminated by a phosphate, as shown in the
figure below. Most cell membranes comprise two
phospholipid layers with the hydrophilic phosphate ends
of each molecule in the outer and inner surfaces. The
hydrophobic chains of carbon atoms extend into the space
between these two surfaces.
