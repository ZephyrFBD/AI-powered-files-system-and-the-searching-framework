The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti (spiral organ). It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar
membrane like flowers projecting up from soil, with their exposed short, hair-like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the
tectorial membrane above them. The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row, numbering
approximately 3,500. The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membraneâ€™s lower
surface. The outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows. They number approximately 12,000, and they function to
fine tune incoming sound waves. The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial
membrane. All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by openi
