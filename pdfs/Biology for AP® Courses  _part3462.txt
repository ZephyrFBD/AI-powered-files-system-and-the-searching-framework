rger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully. Therefore, their offspring also had pelvic anatomy that
enabled successful childbirth (Figure 29.13).

Figure 29.13 To adapt to reproductive fitness, the (a) female pelvis is lighter, wider, shallower, and has a broader angle
between the pubic bones than (b) the male pelvis.
The Lower Limb
The lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The bones of the lower limb are the femur (thigh bone), patella
(kneecap), tibia and fibula (bones of the leg), tarsals (bones of the ankle), and metatarsals and phalanges (bones of the foot)
(Figure 29.14). The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs because of the need
to support the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces from locomotion. In addition to evolutionary fitness, the
bones of an individual will respond to forces exerted upon them.
