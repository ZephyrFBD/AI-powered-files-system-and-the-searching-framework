Compounds
Most elements can interact with other elements to form compounds. For example, when 
hydrogen gas burns in oxygen gas, the elements hydrogen and oxygen combine to form 
the compound water. Conversely, water can be decomposed into its elements by passing 
an electrical current through it (Figure 1.7).

Is the volume of H2 produced larger than the volume of O2 produced 
because (a) hydrogen atoms are lighter than oxygen atoms, (b) hydrogen 
atoms are larger than oxygen atoms, or (c) each water molecule contains 
one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms?
Oxygen gas, O2
Hydrogen gas, H2
Water, H2O
â–² Figure 1.7 Electrolysis of water. Water decomposes into its component elements, hydrogen and  
oxygen, when an electrical current is passed through it. The volume of hydrogen, collected in the right 
test tube, is twice the volume of oxygen.
Decomposing pure water into its constituent elements shows that it contains 
11% hydrogen and 89% oxygen by mass, regardless
