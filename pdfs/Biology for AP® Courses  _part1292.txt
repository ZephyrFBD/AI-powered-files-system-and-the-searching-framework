. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that
the recessive trait reappeared in the F2 generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of
the F1 generation. Mendel also proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic,
and that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical
observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of
the characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait
meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic.

So why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses? To un
