cell.
In the cells of some organisms, mitosis occurs without cytokinesis.
What is the result?
Cells will contain the same number of chromosomes as each
other.
Cells will not survive the process.
Cells will be abnormally small.
Cells will contain more than one nucleus.
The drug Cytochalasin D inhibits actin formation in a cell while
preserving the structure of the rest of the cytoskeleton. Which of the
following processes of the cell cycle would be disrupted by exposure
to Cytochalasin D?
chromosomes lining up on the metaphase plate
DNA synthesis
formation of the cleavage furrow
condensing of chromosomes
The drug Taxol, which comes from the Pacific yew tree, is a
common chemotherapeutic treatment to stop the spread of cancer of
the breast. The principal mechanism by which it works is the
disruption of the microtubule assembly. As a result of its function,
predict the cellular process that Taxol would most directly interfere
with.
degradation of cyclin
binding of cyclin to Cdks
mitotic s
