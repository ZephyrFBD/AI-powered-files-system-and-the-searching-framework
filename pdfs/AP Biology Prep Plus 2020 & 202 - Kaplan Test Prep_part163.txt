e Greek letter psi (Ψ)] predicts which
way water diﬀuses. Water potential is calculated from the solute potential
(ΨS), which is dependent on solute concentration, and the pressure
potential (ΨP), which results from the exertion of pressure on a solution.
When a solution is open to the atmosphere, the pressure potential is
equal to 0 because there is no tension on that solution.
Ψ = ΨP + ΨS
water potential = pressure potential + solute potential
In an open beaker of pure water, the water potential is equal to zero.
There is no solute and no tension on the solution, so the solute and
pressure potentials are zero. If you add solute in a measured
concentration to the beaker, you can calculate the solute potential using
the following formula:
ΨS = –iCRT
where i is equal to the number of particles the molecule will dissolve into
in water, C is the molar concentration, R is the pressure constant (equal to
0.0831 L·bar/mol·K), and T is the temperature of the solution in Kelvins.
For example,
