) is incorrect.
It is a common error to draw the sum vector as the diagonal running between
the tips of the two vectors, as in Fig. 3–6c. This is incorrect: it does not represent
the sum of the two vectors. (In fact, it represents their difference,
as we
will see in the next Section.)
Range of vector lengths. Suppose two
vectors each have length 3.0 units. What is the range of possible lengths for the
vector representing the sum of the two?
RESPONSE The sum can take on any value from
where the
vectors point in the same direction, to
when the vectors are
antiparallel. Magnitudes between 0 and 6.0 occur when the two vectors are at
an angle other than 0° and 180°.
EXERCISE A If the two vectors of Example 3–1 are perpendicular to each other, what is
the resultant vector length?
3–3 Subtraction of Vectors, and
Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
Given a vector 
we define the negative of this vector 
to be a vector with
the same magnitude as 
but opposite in direction, Fig. 3–7. Note, how
