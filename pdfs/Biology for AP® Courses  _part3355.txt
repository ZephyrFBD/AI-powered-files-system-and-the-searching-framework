ht-or-flight response is advantageous in the short-term but not in the long-term.
a.
Fight-or-flight reduces access to glucose reserves and these get depleted fairly quickly.
b.
Fight-or-flight reduces access to glycogen reserves and these get depleted fairly quickly.
c.
Fight-or-flight stimulates access to glucose reserves, but these get depleted fairly quickly.
d.
Fight-or-flight stimulates access to glycogen reserves, but these get depleted fairly quickly.
The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus. Stressful stimuli cause the
hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla (which mediates short-term stress responses) via nerve impulses, and the
adrenal cortex, which mediates long-term stress responses, via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which
is produced by the anterior pituitary.
Short-term Stress Response
When presented with a stressful situation, the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst
