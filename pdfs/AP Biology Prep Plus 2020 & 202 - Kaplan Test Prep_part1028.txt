cursors of glucose. Water is oxidized during the
light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. (A) is correct.
5. C
Ocean acidification selects against thinner-shelled crabs. Since ocean acidification
dissolves shells, shells of thinner-shelled crabs would become even thinner and more
vulnerable to predators than thicker-shelled crabs. As a result, thicker-shelled crabs
would have survived and produced oﬀspring that were also thicker-shelled, leading to an
increase in average shell thickness. (C) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because the data
provide no evidence to support the conclusion that average shell thickness decreased.
Ocean acidification does cause shells to dissolve, but according to the data, the average
shell thickness of the crab population today is greater than that of the crab population
200 years ago. (B) is incorrect because thin-shelled crabs would have been eaten by
predators more easily since they were more vulnerable. (D) is incorrect because ocean
acidification
