ay begin to carry out its specific function.
2. S phase—If the cell is going to divide again, it duplicates its chromosomes during the S phase by the
process of DNA replication.
3. G2 phase—Once the DNA is replicated, the cell enters G2 during which it prepares for cell division.
4. G0 phase—Some cells do not divide, or they delay division; these cells enter the G0 phase sometime
during G1.
C. The second main phase of the cell cycle is cell division, which includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
III.
Mitosis
A. Mitosis—the division of the nucleus, which leads to the separation of the chromosomes that were
previously duplicated in the S phase to produce two chromatids that are attached at their centromeres; it
has four main stages.
B. Phases of Mitosis
1. Prophase—
i.
The chromatids condense.
ii. The nuclear membrane breaks down and disappears.
iii. A cytoskeletal structure called the mitotic spindle forms and is used to pull the chromatids apart to
either pole of the cell.
