r K+ ions are actively transported into the lumen of the tubules. Water then
enters the tubules via osmosis, forming urine. The urine passes through the intestine, and into the rectum. There,
nutrients diffuse back into the hemolymph. Na+ and/or K+ ions are pumped into the hemolymph, and water follows. The
concentrated waste is then excreted.
