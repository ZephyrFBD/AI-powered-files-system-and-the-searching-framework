essels. The resulting chain of water molecules enables water to move
up the stem.
Water molecules also like to stick to other substances—that is, they’re adhesive. Have you ever tried to separate two
glass slides stuck together by a film of water? They’re difficult to separate because of the water sticking to the glass
surfaces.
These two forces taken together—cohesion and adhesion—account for the ability of water to rise up the roots,
trunks, and branches of trees. Since this phenomenon occurs in thin vessels, it’s called capillary action.
Surface Tension
The cohesion of water molecules contributes to another property of water, its surface tension. Like a taut trampoline,
the surface of water has a tension to it. The water molecules are stuck together and light things like leaves and water
striders can sit atop the surface without sinking.
ACIDS AND BASES
We just said that water is important because most reactions occur in watery solutions. Well, there’s one more thing
to remember: re
