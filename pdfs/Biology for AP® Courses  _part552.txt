hy and how does passive transport occur across membranes?

What is tonicity, and how is it relevant to passive transport?
Connection for AP® Courses
Preventing dehydration is important for both plants and animals. Water moves across plasma membranes by a specific
type of diffusion called osmosis. The concentration gradient of water across a membrane is inversely proportional to the
concentration of solutes; that is, water moves through channel proteins called aquaporins from higher water concentration to
lower water concentration. Solute concentration outside and inside the cell influences the rate of osmosis. Tonicity describes
how the extracellular concentration of solutes can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis, often correlating with
the osmolarity of the solution, i.e., the total solute concentration of the solution. In a hypotonic situation, because the
extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes (lower osmolarity) than the fluid inside the cell, water
