he velocity is
increasing. For times after 
the slope begins to decrease and reaches zero (
)
where x has its maximum value, at point 
in Fig. 2–29. Beyond point 
the
slope is negative, as for point 
The velocity is therefore negative, which
makes sense since x is now decreasing—the particle is moving toward decreasing
values of x, to the left on a standard xy plot.

Analyzing with graphs. Figure 2–31
shows the velocity as a function of time for two cars accelerating from 0 to
in a time of 10.0 s. Compare (a) the average acceleration; (b) the 
instantaneous acceleration; and (c) the total distance traveled for the two cars.
RESPONSE (a) Average acceleration is
