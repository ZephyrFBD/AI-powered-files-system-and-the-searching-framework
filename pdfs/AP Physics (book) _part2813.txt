ns with
spherical surfaces. Rays from this point that pass through the outer regions of the
lens are brought to a focus at a different point from those that pass through the
center of the lens. This is called spherical aberration, and is shown exaggerated in
Fig. 25â€“25. Consequently, the image seen on a screen or film will not be a point
but a tiny circular patch of light. If the sensor or film is placed at the point C, as
indicated, the circle will have its smallest diameter, which is referred to as the
circle of least confusion. Spherical aberration is present whenever spherical 
surfaces are used. It can be reduced by using nonspherical 
lens 
surfaces, but grinding such lenses is difficult and expensive. Spherical aberration
can be reduced by the use of several lenses in combination, and by using primarily
the central part of lenses.
For object points off the lens axis, additional aberrations occur. Rays passing
through the different parts of the lens cause spreading of the image t
