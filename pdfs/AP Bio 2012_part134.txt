source of genetic variation found in the 
tryptophan synthesis pathways of both species would have occurred primarily 
with the imperfect nature of DNA replication, which could have led to an 
increase in genetic variation in both species.

Question 36
Essential Knowledge
4.A.1: The subcomponents of biological molecules and 
their sequence determine the properties of that molecule. 
Science Practice
7.1: The student can connect phenomena and models 
across spatial and temporal scales.
Learning Objective 
4.1: The student is able to explain the connection between 
the sequence and subcomponents of a biological polymer 
and its properties.
(A)
This option is correct. The mutation results in the replacement of an amino 
acid, which alters the properties of the R-group both structurally and 
functionally; thus, the interactions between adjacent hemoglobin molecules 
would also be altered. In this case, hemoglobin molecules would tend to stick 
together as a result of hydrophobic
