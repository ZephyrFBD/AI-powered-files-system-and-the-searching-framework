 from a substance at 
higher temperature to one at lower temperature. Thus, the influx of heat we feel when we 
touch a hot object tells us that the object is at a higher temperature than our hand.
The temperature scales commonly employed in science are the Celsius and Kelvin 
scales. The Celsius scale was originally based on the assignment of 0 °C to the freezing 
point of water and 100 °C to its boiling point at sea level (Figure 1.19).
The Kelvin scale is the SI temperature scale, and the SI unit of temperature is the 
kelvin (K). Zero on the Kelvin scale is the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases, a 
temperature referred to as absolute zero. On the Celsius scale, absolute zero has the value 
-273.15 °C. The Celsius and Kelvin scales have equal-sized units—that is, a kelvin is the 
same size as a degree Celsius. Thus, the Kelvin and Celsius scales are related according to
 
K = °C + 273.15 
[1.3]
The freezing point of water, 0 °C, is 273.15 K (Figure 1.19). Notice that we
