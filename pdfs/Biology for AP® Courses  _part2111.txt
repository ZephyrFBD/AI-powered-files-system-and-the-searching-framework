78. Selection processes in changing and unchanging
environments differ. Connect the effects of negative and
positive selection pressures to changes in the
environment.
79. In biology, the word “race” is rarely used. It could be
imagined to be synonymous with a subspecies. Species is
well defined, at least when horizontal gene transfer is not
taken into account, by reproductive isolation. Speciation
may arise through geographic isolation.
A. Aside from geographic isolation leading to reproductive
isolation, predict two other mechanisms of speciation in a
population and how these mechanisms can lead to a
scientific definition of a subspecies.
The use of the term “race” with regard to human
populations might be a reference to cultural or
socioeconomic isolation, and has often been mistaken to
have biological significance. Rosenberg et al. (Science,
2002) sampled the genes of 1,056 people from 52
populations. They compared genetic variations within each
