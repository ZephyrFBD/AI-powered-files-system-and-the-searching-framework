The properties of an acid solution that relate directly to the concentration of 
H+1aq2, such as electrical conductivity and rate of reaction with an active metal, are less 
evident for a solution of a weak acid than for a solution of a strong acid of the same con-
centration. Figure 16.11 presents an experiment that demonstrates this difference with 
1 M CH3COOH and 1 M HCl. The concentration of H+1aq2 in 1 M CH3COOH is only 
0.004 M, whereas the 1 M HCl solution contains 1 M H+1aq2. As a result, the reaction rate 
with the metal is much faster in the HCl solution.
As the concentration of a weak acid increases, the equilibrium concentration of 
H+1aq2 increases, as expected. However, as shown in Figure 16.12, the percent ionization 
decreases as the concentration increases. Thus, the concentration of H+1aq2 is not directly 
proportional to the concentration of the weak acid. For example, doubling the concen-
tration of a weak acid does not double the concentration of H+1aq2.
