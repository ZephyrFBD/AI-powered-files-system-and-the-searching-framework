one lens is converging and the other diverging, and they are often cemented
together (Fig. 25–28). Such a lens combination is called an achromatic doublet
(or “color-corrected” lens).
To reduce aberrations, high-quality lenses are compound lenses consisting of
many simple lenses, referred to as elements. A typical high-quality camera lens
may contain six to eight (or more) elements. For simplicity we will usually indi-
cate lenses in diagrams as if they were simple lenses.
The human eye is also subject to aberrations, but they are minimal. Spherical
aberration, for example, is minimized because (1) the cornea is less curved at the
edges than at the center, and (2) the lens is less dense at the edges than at the center.
Both effects cause rays at the outer edges to be bent less strongly, and thus help
to reduce spherical aberration. Chromatic aberration is partially compensated for
because the lens absorbs the shorter wavelengths appreciably and the retina is less
sensitive to t
