tanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface
(or abaxis). The epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange. It contains stomata (Figure 23.24): openings through
which the exchange of gases takes place. Two guard cells surround each stoma, regulating its opening and closing.
Figure 23.24 Visualized at 500x with a scanning electron microscope, several stomata are clearly visible on (a) the
surface of this sumac (Rhus glabra) leaf. At 5,000x magnification, the guard cells of (b) a single stoma from lyre-leaved
sand cress (Arabidopsis lyrata) have the appearance of lips that surround the opening. In this (c) light micrograph
cross-section of an A. lyrata leaf, the guard cell pair is visible along with the large, sub-stomatal air space in the leaf.

The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick; however, in plants that grow in very hot or very c
