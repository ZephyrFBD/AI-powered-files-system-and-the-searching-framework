and translation; the operon model of the regulation of gene expression; evolution and 
natural selection; and interactions between organisms and their environment. 
Interspersed within each investigation are supplemental activities designed to keep 
students on track and to provide opportunities for them to take a deeper dive into the 
concepts. You may assign these activities for homework or ask students to do them as 
they work through the investigation. 
â–  PREPARATION 
Materials and Equipment 
Supplies for plasmid transformation systems may be purchased in kits from commercial 
vendors or purchased individually, depending on your current inventory. A partial list 
of suppliers is provided in the Supplemental Resources section. At minimum, plasmids 
should contain the gene for ampicillin resistance (pAMP), as experimental procedures 
typically use ampicillin to select transformed cells. In addition, plasmids with colored 
marker genes like beta-GAL and fluoresc
