be effective. He also saw
that the contracting frog muscle was a sensitive instrument for detecting electric
“tension” or “electromotive force” (his words for what we now call voltage), in 
fact more sensitive than the best available electroscopes that he and others had 
developed.†
Volta’s research found that certain combinations of metals produced a greater
effect than others, and, using his measurements, he listed them in order of effec-
tiveness. (This “electrochemical series” is still used by chemists today.) He also
found that carbon could be used in place of one of the metals.
Volta then conceived his greatest contribution to science. Between a disc of
zinc and one of silver, he placed a piece of cloth or paper soaked in salt solution
or dilute acid and piled a “battery” of such couplings, one on top of another, as
shown in Fig. 18–2. This “pile” or “battery” produced a much increased potential
difference. Indeed, when strips of metal connected to the two ends of the pile
were b
