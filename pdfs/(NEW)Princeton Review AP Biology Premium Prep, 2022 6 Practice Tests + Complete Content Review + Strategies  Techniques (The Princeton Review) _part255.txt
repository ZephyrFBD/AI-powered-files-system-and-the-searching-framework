sed to oxygen bubbles through the growth media. What would you expect to see in terms of ATP
production in the sample of cells placed in a low pH, with respect to the control population?
(A) ATP production decreases.
(B) ATP production increases.
(C) ATP production stays the same.
(D) ATP production ceases entirely.
10. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy, or disorder, is constantly increasing in the universe
for spontaneous processes. Therefore, how is it possible that organisms exist in very ordered states?
(A) The Second Law of Thermodynamics does not apply to biological life.
(B) Energy can be created or destroyed.
(C) The catabolic reactions are always equal and opposite of the anabolic reactions.
(D) Biological life actually creates an increase in entropy through dissemination of heat and waste.
Summary
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. There are endergonic reactions and exergonic reactions. The change in
Gibbs free energy indicates whether the reaction will
