Meiotic cell division is responsible for the independent
assortment of alleles.
Most of the life of the cell is spent in meiotic cell division.
Below is a diagram that shows the “floating disk” method that you
may have used to study photosynthesis.
Disks that are cut out of green plant leaves are soaked in a 1%
solution of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as a source of carbon
dioxide. They are then transferred to a beaker that is also filled with
sodium bicarbonate. They sink to the bottom of the beaker because
the air spaces in the leaves have been replaced with NaHCO3,
making the leaves heavier. The experiment begins when a strong
light is turned on. As the plant cells carry out photosynthesis, t
