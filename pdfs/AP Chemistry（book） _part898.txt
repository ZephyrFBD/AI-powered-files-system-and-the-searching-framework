Line Spectra
A particular source of radiant energy may emit a single wavelength, as in the light from 
a laser. Radiation composed of a single wavelength is monochromatic. However, most 
common radiation sources, including incandescent light bulbs and stars, produce radi-
ation containing many different wavelengths, polychromatic radiation. A spectrum is 
produced when radiation from a polychromatic source is separated into its component 
wavelengths, as shown in Figure 6.9. The resulting spectrum consists of a continuous 
range of colorsâ€”violet merges into indigo, indigo into blue, and so forth, with no (or 
very few) blank spots. This rainbow of colors, containing light of all wavelengths, is 
called a continuous spectrum. The most familiar example of a continuous spectrum 
is the rainbow produced when raindrops or mist acts as a prism for sunlight. 
Not all radiation sources produce a continuous spectrum. Whe
