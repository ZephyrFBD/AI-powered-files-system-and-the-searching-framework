The CRISPR system was discovered in cultures of yogurt
in 2002. Subsequently, researchers developed a technology
based on the manipulation of this system. The code for the
prokaryotic CRISPR/cas system is highly conserved and is
found in the human genome. DNA sequences are known to
encode proteins responsible for many heritable diseases.
CRISPR/cas is a technology that allows DNA to be
cleaved at the boundaries of
