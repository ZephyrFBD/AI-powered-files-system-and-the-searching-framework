CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter supported Big Ideas: EVO, ENE, and SYI.
Living things require a constant supply of energy.
Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy. In
eukaryotic autotrophs, photosynthesis occurs in thylakoid
membranes and stroma of chloroplasts. Here is the general
equation: 6CO2 + 12H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2.
Photosynthesis is a reduction reaction because in order for glucose
to form, hydrogen binds to carbon in CO2. The production of sugar
occurs by a process called carbon fixation.
The light-dependent reactions begin when light is absorbed by
photosynthetic pigments in light-harvesting complexes called
photosystems, located within the grana (stacks of thylakoids).
Different photosynthetic pigments absorb light of differing
wavelengths, expanding the range of light that can power
photosynthesis. Electrons become excited and enter an electron
transport chain (linear flow of electrons) that results in the
production of ATP by chemiosmosis (similar to c
