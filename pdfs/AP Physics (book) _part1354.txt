ed 2.5 m in front of a loudspeaker on stage. (a) What was
the power output of the speaker, assuming uniform spherical
spreading of the sound and neglecting absorption in the
air? (b) How far away would the sound level be 85 dB?
16. (II) A fireworks shell explodes 100 m above the ground, cre-
ating colorful sparks. How much greater is the sound level of
the explosion for a person
at a point directly below
the explosion than for 
a person a horizontal
distance of 200 m away
(Fig. 12–34)?
5.0 * 10–5 m2.

6. (II) A person, with his ear to the ground, sees a huge stone
strike the concrete pavement. A moment later two sounds
are heard from the impact: one travels in the air and the
other in the concrete, and they are 0.80 s apart. How far
away did the impact occur? See Table 12–1.
7. (III) A stone is dropped from the top of a cliff. The splash it
makes when striking the water below is heard 2.7 s later.
How high is the cliff?
