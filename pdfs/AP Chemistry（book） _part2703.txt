Addition of Strong Acids or Bases to Buffers
Letâ€™s now consider in a more quantitative way how a buffered solution responds to 
addition of a strong acid or base. In this discussion, it is important to understand that 
neutralization reactions between strong acids and weak bases proceed essentially to completion, 
as do those between strong bases and weak acids. This is because water is a product of the 
reaction, and you have an equilibrium constant of 1>Kw = 1014 in your favor when mak-
ing water. 
 (Section 16.3) Thus, as long as we do not exceed the buffering capacity of 
the buffer, we can assume that the strong acid or strong base is completely consumed by 
reaction with the buffer.
Consider a buffer that contains a weak acid HA and its conjugate base A-. When a 
strong acid is added to this buffer, the added H+ is consumed by A- to produce HA; thus, 
3HA4 increases and 3A-4 decreases. (See Equation 17.7.) Upon addition of a strong base, 
the added OH- is con
