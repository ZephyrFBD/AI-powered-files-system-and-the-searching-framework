nd Protein Y.
c. Analyze the data and describe the influence of Protein X and Protein Y on the gene expression of Enzyme
A and Enzyme B. Include at which point in gene expression the regulation likely occurs.
d. Another scientist repeats the experiment with Protein Y and Enzyme C, and adds a known inhibitor to
Protein Y to the tube. Predict the effect on mRNA, protein, and total enzyme levels as a result.
SCORING GUIDELINES
To help you grade this sample free response, we’ve put together a checklist that you can use to calculate the number
of points that should be assigned to each part of this question. We’ll first explain the important points on the
checklist and then give you sample student responses to show you how test reviewers would evaluate them.
