Imagine two different cities: City 1 (in the south) and City 2 (in the north). Prior to the Industrial Revolution, both of
these cities had unpolluted environments. In both of these environments, dark moths and light moths lived
comfortably side by side. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say their proportions were a perfect fifty-fifty, half dark and
half light. However, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, City 2, our northern city, was heavily polluted,
whereas City 1, our southern city, was unchanged. In the north, where all the trees and buildings were covered with
