1 pt: Phototropism describes a plant’s response to light. 1 pt: For phototropism, auxin accumulates on the shady side
of shoot
tips.
1 pt: The plant hormone auxin stimulates plant growth in stems
(phototropism and gravitropism).
1 pt: Gravitropism describes a plant’s response to gravity. 1 pt: For gravitropism, auxin accumulates on the lower
side of shoot
tips.
1 pt: Abscission is the loss of leaves in response to winter (cold
temperatures and reduced daylight hours).
1 pt: Abscission is preceded by the withdrawal of nutrients from
leaves.
1 pt: Dormancy is a plant’s response to unfavorable environmental
conditions.
1 pt: Seed dormancy can be broken by a response to temperature, fire,
scarification, or day length (photoperiodism)
