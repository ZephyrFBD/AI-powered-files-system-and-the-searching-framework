f it is released, it will fall to the ground due to the gravitational force, and can
do work on, say, a stake, driving it into the ground.
Let us seek the form for the gravitational potential energy of an object near
the surface of the Earth. For an object of mass m to be lifted vertically, an upward
force at least equal to its weight, mg, must be exerted on it, say by a person’s
hand. To lift the object without acceleration, the person exerts an “external
force”
If it is raised a vertical height h, from position 
to 
in 
Fig. 6–11 (upward direction chosen positive), a person does work equal to the
product of the “external” force she exerts,
upward, multiplied by the
vertical displacement h. That is,

Gravity is also acting on the object as it moves from

object equal to

Next, if we allow the object to start from rest at 
and fall freely under the
action of gravity, it acquires a velocity given
