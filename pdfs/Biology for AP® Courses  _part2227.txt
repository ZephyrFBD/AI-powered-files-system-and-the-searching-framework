shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don’t show a common
ancestor but do show relationships among species.
Figure 20.2 Both of these phylogenetic trees shows the relationship of the three domains of life—Bacteria, Archaea,
and Eukarya—but the (a) rooted tree attempts to identify when various species diverged from a common ancestor
while the (b) unrooted tree does not. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Gaba)
In a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships (Figure 20.3). The point where a split occurs, called
a branch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. A lineage that evolved early from the
root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called
sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not
definitively determined all of the relatio
