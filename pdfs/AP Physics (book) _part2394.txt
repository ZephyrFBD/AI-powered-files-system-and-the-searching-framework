7. The battery mentioned in Question 6 is disconnected. Will
a current be induced in the second loop? If so, when does
it start and stop? In what direction is this current?
8. In Fig. 21–49, determine the direction of the induced cur-
rent in resistor 
(a) when coil B is moved toward coil A,
(b) when coil B is moved away from A, (c) when the resis-
tance 
is increased but the coils remain fixed. Explain
your answers.

5. (a) If the north pole of a thin flat magnet moves on a table
toward a loop also on the table (Fig. 21–48), in what direc-
tion is the induced current in the loop? Assume the magnet
is the same thickness as the wire. (b) What if the magnet is
four times thicker than the wire loop? Explain 
your answers.
