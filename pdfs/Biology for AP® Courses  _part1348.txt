 to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is
transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (Figure 12.15), and
these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.
Since Mendelâ€™s experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold
true. Instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.

Equal Segregation of Alleles
Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F1 generations that all expressed the dominant
trait and F2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the law of
segregation. This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring
have an equal likelihood of inheriting eit
