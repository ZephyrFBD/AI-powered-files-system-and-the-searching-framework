e the cell cycle. The
loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty
instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other
mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more
accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal
cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood cancer).
10.5 Prokaryotic Cell Division
In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division, the genomic DNA is replicated and then each copy is allocated into a
daughter cell. In addition, the cytoplasmic contents are divided evenly and distributed to the new cells. However, there are
many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division. Bacteria have a single, circular DNA chromosome but
no nucleus. Therefore, mitosis is not n
