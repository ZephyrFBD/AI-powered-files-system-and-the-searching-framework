cleotide base pairs with its complementary pyrimidine or purine in the DNA
template sequence on the gene.
3. Termination—when a termination sequence, or terminator, at the end of the gene is reached, RNA
polymerase leaves the promoter, and the RNA transcript is released.
C. In eukaryotes, before RNA leaves the nucleus, it is modified.
D. rRNA—as part of the ribosomal subunits—plus mRNA and tRNA all travel through the nuclear pores of
the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm where they all participate in protein synthesis.
IV.
Translation
A. Translation—also called protein synthesis, occurs in ribosomes in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells.
B. Synthesis of protein from mRNA occurs in the 5’ to 3’ direction.
C. Requires all 3 RNA molecules (mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA) and codons (sets of 3 nucleotide RNA bases
that code for amino acids).
D. The process of translation has three major steps:
1. Initiation—the start codon AUG (calls for the amino acid methionine) on the mRNA transcri
