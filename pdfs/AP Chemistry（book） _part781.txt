, the variation from one molecule to 
another is generally small. If we consider C—H bond enthalpies in many different com-
pounds, we find that the average bond enthalpy is 413 kJ/mol, close to the 415 kJ/mol 
value we just calculated from for the dissociation of CH4.
The bond enthalpy is always a positive quantity because energy is required  
to break chemical bonds. Conversely, energy is always released when a bond  
forms between two gaseous atoms or molecular fragments. The greater the  
bond enthalpy, the stronger the bond.
Table 5.4 lists average bond enthalpies for a number of atom pairs. Further, a mole-
cule with strong chemical bonds is generally less likely to undergo chemical change than

one with weak bonds. As we will learn in later chapters, atom pairs are sometimes held 
together by multiple bonds. For example, the oxygen atoms in an O2 molecule are held 
together by a double bond, O “ O, rather than a single bond, O—O.
