egments (vRNA). Each
segment encodes one or two proteins that support viral
replication. On the outer surface of the envelope are
proteins that recognize and bind to host receptors.
A. Annotate the representation below to briefly describe
each process associated with a numbered label.

The human-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
and many cancers are cause by double-stranded RNA
retroviruses.
C. Contrast the processes of viral replication of HIV and
influenza A virus.
D. Explain the difference in the effects of infection by
HIV and influenza A virus on host genetic variability.
E. Measured mutation rates for influenza A virus and HIV
are nearly identical (Sanjuan et al., Jour. Virology, 2010).
Explain this observation even though host error-checking
operates in one of these replication modes.
