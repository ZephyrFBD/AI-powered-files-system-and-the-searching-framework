s of an atom? 
(a) The distance from the nucleus where the probability of 
finding an electron goes to zero. (b) The distance between 
the nuclei of two atoms that are bonded together. (c) The 
effective nuclear charge of an atom.
 7.20  With the exception of helium, the noble gases condense to 
form solids when they are cooled sufficiently. At tempera-
tures below 83 K, argon forms a close-packed solid whose 
structure is shown below. (a) What is the apparent radius of 
an argon atom in solid argon, assuming the atoms touch as 
shown in this Ô¨Ågure? (b) Is this value larger or smaller than 
the bonding atomic radius estimated for argon in Figure 7.7? 
(c) Based on this comparison would you say that the atoms 
are held together by chemical bonds in solid argon?
 7.27  Identify each statement as true or false: (a) Cations are larger 
than their corresponding neutral atoms. (b) Li+ is smaller 
than Li. (c) Cl- is bigger than I-.
 7.28  Explain the following variations in atomic or ionic r
