t made it somehow more modern, more human; like a rough joke thrown into a serious 
scene, it heightened the poignancy which all beauty has. 
Chapter XXIV
Shortly before Christmas Dirk Stroeve came to ask me to spend the holiday with him. He had a 
characteristic sentimentality about the day and wanted to pass it among his friends with suitable 
ceremonies. Neither of us had seen Strickland for two or three weeks -- I because I had been busy 
with friends who were spending a little while in Paris, and Stroeve because, having quarreled with 
him more violently than usual, he had made up his mind to have nothing more to do with him. 
Strickland was impossible, and he swore never to speak to him again. But the season touched him 
with gentle feeling, and he hated the thought of Strickland spending Christmas Day by himself; he 
ascribed his own emotions to him, and could not bear that on an occasion given up to good-
fellowship the lonely painter should be abandoned to his own melancholy.
