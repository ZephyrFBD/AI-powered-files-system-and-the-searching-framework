the early morning. This latter behavior gave rise to the Drosophila genus name, which 
means “lover of dew.” The explanation for the species name melanogaster should be clear 
after observing the fly’s physical features. It has a black stomach. No doubt the dew-
loving, black-bellied fly will continue to make contributions to the scientific community 
and to student projects.
These investigations explore the environmental choices that fruit flies make. A 
choice chamber is designed to give fruit flies two choices during any one test, although 
students could also think about how to build an apparatus that would give fruit flies 
more than two choices. Adult fruit flies are attracted to substances that offer food or an 
environment in which to lay eggs and develop larvae. Typically those environments are 
rotting or fermenting fruit. Adult fruit flies are attracted to bright light, and their larvae 
move away from bright light. Adult fruit flies also demonstrate a nega
