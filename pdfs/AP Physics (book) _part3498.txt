 used to treat it. Rapidly growing
cancer cells are especially susceptible to destruction by radiation. Nonetheless,
large doses are needed to kill the cancer cells, and some of the surrounding
normal cells are inevitably killed as well. It is for this reason that cancer patients
receiving radiation therapy often suffer side effects characteristic of radiation
sickness. To minimize the destruction of normal cells, a narrow beam of 
or
X-rays is often used when a cancerous tumor is well localized. The beam is
directed at the tumor, and the source (or body) is rotated so that the beam passes
through various parts of the body to keep the dose at any one place as low as
possible—except at the tumor and its immediate surroundings, where the beam
passes at all times (Fig. 31–17). The radiation may be from a radioactive source
such as 
or it may be from an X-ray machine that produces photons in 
the range 200 keV to 5 MeV. Protons, neutrons, electrons, and pions, which are
produced in particl
