ant. Recall, for example, that H2O can participate in acidâ€“base reac-
tions as either a proton donor or a proton acceptor. 
 (Section 16.3) All these proper-
ties play a role in our environment.
The Global Water Cycle
All the water on Earth is connected in a global water cycle (Figure 18.16). Most of the pro-
cesses depicted here rely on the phase changes of water. For instance, warmed by the Sun, 
liquid water in the oceans evaporates into the atmosphere as water vapor and condenses 
into liquid water droplets that we see as clouds. Water droplets in the clouds can crystal-
lize to ice, which can precipitate as hail or snow. Once on the ground, the hail or snow 
melts to liquid water, which soaks into the ground. If conditions are right, it is also pos-
sible for ice on the ground to sublime to water vapor in the atmosphere. Because the pro-
cesses occurring on the surface (evaporation, sublimation) are endothermic and those 
occurring in the atmosphere (condensation, crystallization)
