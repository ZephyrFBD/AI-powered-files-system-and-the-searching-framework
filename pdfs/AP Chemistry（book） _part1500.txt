How many nonbonding elec-
tron pairs are around the A atom from this information? 
 
(b) How many nonbonding electrons surround the Xe in 
XeF2? (c) Is XeF2 linear?
 9.14  (a) Methane 1CH42 and the perchlorate ion 1ClO4
- 2 are both 
described as tetrahedral. What does this indicate about their 
bond angles? (b) The NH3 molecule is trigonal pyramidal, 
while BF3 is trigonal planar. Which of these molecules is flat?
 9.15 How does a trigonal pyramid differ from a tetrahedron so far 
as molecular geometry is concerned?
 9.16  Describe the bond angles to be found in each of the follow-
ing molecular structures: (a) trigonal planar, (b) tetrahedral, 
(c) octahedral, (d) linear.
 9.17 (a) An AB6 molecule has no lone pairs of electrons on the A 
atom. What is its molecular geometry? (b) An AB4 molecule 
has two lone pairs of electrons on the A atom (in addition 
to the four B atoms). What is the electron-domain geometry 
around the A atom? (c) For the AB4 molecule in part (b), pre-
dict the
