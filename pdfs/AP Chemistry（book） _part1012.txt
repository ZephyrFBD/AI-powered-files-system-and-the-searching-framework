indexed by a single quantum 
number n that is an integer. 
(a) As drawn, which quantum 
numbers are involved in the 
transition that requires the 
most energy? (b) Which quan-
tum numbers are involved in 
the transition that requires the 
least energy? (c) Based on the

the transition: (i) n = 1 to n = 2; (ii) n = 2 to n = 3; (iii) 
n = 2 to n = 4; (iv) n = 1 to n = 3. [Section 6.3]
 
6.7  Consider the three electronic transitions in a hydrogen atom 
shown here, labeled A, B, and C.
 
 (a)  
Three electromagnetic waves, all drawn on the same 
scale, are also shown. Each corresponds to one of the 
transitions. Which electromagnetic wave (i), (ii), or (iii), 
is associated with electronic transition C?
