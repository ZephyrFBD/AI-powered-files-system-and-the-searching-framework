Lipids
Lipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase. However, the bulk of lipid digestion
occurs in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger
the release of bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily
triglycerides by emulsification. Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small
lipid globules. These small globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. Lipids
are hydrophobic substances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water.
