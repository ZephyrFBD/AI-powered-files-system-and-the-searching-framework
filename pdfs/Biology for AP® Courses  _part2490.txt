 in Europe dropped by 50 percent during
this outbreak. Bubonic plague would strike Europe more than once.
One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death (1346 to 1361) that is believed to have been another outbreak
of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is thought to have originated initially in China and spread
along the Silk Road, a network of land and sea trade routes, to the Mediterranean region and Europe, carried by rat fleas
living on black rats that were always present on ships. The Black Death reduced the worldâ€™s population from an estimated
450 million to about 350 to 375 million. Bubonic plague struck London hard again in the mid-1600s (Figure 22.21). In
modern times, approximately 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague arise globally each year. Although contracting bubonic plague
before antibiotics meant almost certain death, the bacterium responds to several types of modern antibiotics, and mortality
rates from plague are now very low.
