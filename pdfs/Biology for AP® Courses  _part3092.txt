al lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement.
Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in
Figure 26.22. For example, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement
of the hand. Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-
making. Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality,
socialization, and assessing risk.
Figure 26.22 Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle groups. Muscle groups that are neighbors in
the body are generally controlled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well. For example, the neurons that
control finger movement are near the neurons that control hand movement.
The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain. Neurons in the parie
