tains a C ¬F bond and not an H¬F bond, it does not form 
hydrogen bonds. In H2NNH2, however, we find N ¬ H bonds, 
and the Lewis structure shows a nonbonding pair of electrons on 
each N atom, telling us hydrogen bonds can exist between the 
molecules:

Check Although we can generally identify substances that par-
ticipate in hydrogen bonding based on their containing N, O, 
or F covalently bonded to H, drawing the Lewis structure for the 
interaction provides a way to check the prediction.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following substances is most likely to be a liq-
uid at room temperature?
(a) formaldehyde, H2CO  
 
(b) fluoromethane, CH3F
(c) hydrogen cyanide, HCN (d) hydrogen peroxide, H2O2
(e) hydrogen sulfide, H2S
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
In which of these substances is significant hydrogen bond-
ing possible: methylene chloride 1CH2Cl22, phosphine 
1PH32, chloramine 1NH2Cl2, acetone 1CH3COCH32?
