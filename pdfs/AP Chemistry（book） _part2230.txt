alf-life for a first-order reaction by substituting 3A4t1>2 = 1
23A40 for 3A4t and t1>2 for t 
in Equation 14.12. We find the half-life of a second-order reaction by making the same 
substitutions into Equation 14.14:
1

23A40
= kt1>2 +

3A40

3A40
= kt1>2
                 t1>2 =
1
k3A40

In this case, the half-life depends on the initial concentration of reactant—the lower the 
initial concentration, the longer the half-life.
Give It Some Thought
Does the half-life of a zero-order reaction depend on the initial concentration of the 
reactant?
14.5 ∣ Temperature and Rate
The rates of most chemical reactions increase as the temperature rises. For example, 
dough rises faster at room temperature than when refrigerated, and plants grow more 
rapidly in warm weather than in cold. We can see the effect of temperature on reaction 
rate by observing a chemiluminescence reaction (one that produces light), such as that 
in Cyalume® light sticks (Figure 14.12).
