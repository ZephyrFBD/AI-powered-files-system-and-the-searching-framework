Introduction
Most people think of bacteria as disease-causing organisms. Although some bacteria are pathogens, many are not. For
example, the commensal bacteria that inhabit our skin and gastrointestinal tract do a host of good things for us. They protect
us from pathogens, help us digest our food, and produce some of our vitamins and other nutrients. These activities have
been known for a long time. More recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our
moods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns.
The Human Microbiome Project has begun the process of cataloging our normal bacteria (and archaea) so we can better
understand these functions. You can learn more about the Human Microbiome Project here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
