 light-
colored beetles, as in diagram I. The pollution
helped the predators find the darkened tree
trunks.
b.
The coloration in the population split into two
extremes, as in diagram II. Both the light-
colored and the dark-colored beetles were able
to hide on the darker tree trunks.
c.
The coloration range became narrower, as in
diagram III. The predators selected beetles at the
color extremes.
d.
The coloration in the population shifted toward
more dark-colored beetles, as in diagram IV. The
light-colored beetles were found more easily by
the predators than were the dark-colored beetles.
42. A population of rodents settles on the shore of an
island close to the Arctic Circle. The landscape consists
mainly of rocks. If the individuals are too large, they
cannot hide in crevices to escape hawks. On the other
hand, small bodies do not maintain internal temperature in
cold weather. Show diagrammatically the change in the
population and explain what selective pressures took
place.
