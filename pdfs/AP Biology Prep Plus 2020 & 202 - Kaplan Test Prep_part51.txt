e, lipase, and pepsin, which are
enzymes that break down lactose, lipids, and proteins, respectively;
keratin and collagen, which provide structural support; hemoglobin,
which transports oxygen and iron; and insulin, which is a hormone that
regulates blood glucose levels.
Proteins are formed from amino acids via dehydration synthesis. An
amino acid consists of a central carbon, an amino group, a carboxyl
group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain R group. The R group
determines the amino acid’s properties (size, polarity, and pH). In
organisms, there are twenty α-amino acids; each is either acidic, basic,
polar, or nonpolar at physiological pH (7.2–7.4). During dehydration
synthesis, the amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxyl
group of another to form a peptide bond and release a water molecule.
A chain of amino acids is a polypeptide, which typically ranges from 50 to
1,000 amino acids. Since polypeptides have two distinct ends, they have
directionality. The amino acid se
