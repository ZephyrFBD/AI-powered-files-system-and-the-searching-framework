e Effect of Temperature Changes on Pressure
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If you fill your car tire to a pressure of 32 psi (pounds per 
square inch) on a hot summer day when the temperature is 
35 °C 195 °F2, what is the pressure (in psi) on a cold winter 
day when the temperature is -15 °C 15 °F2? Assume no gas 
leaks out between measurements and the volume of the  
tire does not change.  
(a) 38 psi (b) 27 psi (c) -13.7 psi (d) 1.8 psi  
(e) 13.7 psi
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The pressure in a natural-gas tank is maintained at 2.20 atm. 
On a day when the temperature is -15 °C, the volume of gas 
in the tank is 3.25 * 103 m3. What is the volume of the same 
quantity of gas on a day when the temperature is 31 °C?
given data give
P
2 = 11.5 atm2a 723 K
298 K b = 3.6 atm
Check This answer is intuitively reasonable—increasing the tem-
perature of a gas increases its pressure.
Comment It is evident from this example why aerosol cans carry a 
warning not to incinerate.
