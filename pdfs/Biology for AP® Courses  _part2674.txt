al
potential of the proton gradient. This is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-H+
symporter.
Phloem STEs have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressure-
driven bulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap. Companion cells are associated with STEs. They assist with metabolic
activities and produce energy for the STEs (Figure 23.36).
Figure 23.36 Phloem is comprised of cells called sieve-tube elements. Phloem sap travels through perforations called
sieve tube plates. Neighboring companion cells carry out metabolic functions for the sieve-tube elements and provide
them with energy. Lateral sieve areas connect the sieve-tube elements to the companion cells.

Once in the phloem, the photosynthates are translocated to the closest sink. Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that contains
up to 30 percent sugar, minerals, amino acids, and plant growth regulator
