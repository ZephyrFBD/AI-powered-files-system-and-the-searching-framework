Using the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. From
this, calculations are used to estimate the total population size. This method assumes that the larger the population, the lower
the percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals. For
example, if 80 deer are captured, tagged, and released into the forest, and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are
already marked, we can determine the population size (N) using the following equation:
(number marked fir t catch x total number of second catch)
number marked second catch
 = N
Using our example, the population size would be estimated at 400.
(80 x 100)
20
 = 400
Therefore, there are an estimated 400
