 
(b) 2.1 * 108 g 235U 21.53 (a) Nucleus (b), 51V has the largest bind-
ing energy per nucleon. 21.55 (a) Nal is a good source of iodine because 
iodine is a large percentage of its mass; it is completely dissociated into 
ions in aqueous solution, and iodine in the form of I-1aq2 is mobile and 
immediately available for biouptake. (b) A Geiger counter placed near 
the thyroid immediately after ingestion will register background, then 
gradually increase in signal until the concentration of iodine in the thy-
roid reaches a maximum. Over time, iodine-131 decays, and the signal 
decreases. (c) The radioactive iodine will decay to 0.01% of the original 
amount in approximately 107 days. 21.57 (a) Characteristics (ii) and (iv) 
are required for a fuel in a nuclear power plant. (b) 235U 21.59 The control 
rods in a nuclear reactor regulate the ï¬‚ux of neutrons to keep the reac-
tion chain self-sustaining and also to prevent the reactor core from over-
heating. They are composed of materials
