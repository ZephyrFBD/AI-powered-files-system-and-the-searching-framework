phase. This could cause, in the absence of other controls, a more rapid onset of mitosis
and uncontrolled cell division. (A) is thus correct.

The diagram depicts a mitochondrion, where the reactions of cellular respiration take
place. Pyruvate, produced from the breakdown of glucose in glycolysis, enters the
mitochondrial matrix along with oxygen and NADH; the Krebs cycle takes place (as well
as electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation); and ATP is produced. In fact, the
