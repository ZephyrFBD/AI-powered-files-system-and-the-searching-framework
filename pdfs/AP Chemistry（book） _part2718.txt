 is determined by the concentration of acid not 
yet neutralized. This calculation is illustrated in Sample Exercise 17.7(a).
 3. Equivalence point: At the equivalence point an equal number of moles of NaOH 
and HCl have reacted, leaving only a solution of their salt, NaCl. The pH of the solu-
tion is 7.00 because the cation of a strong base (in this case Na+) and the anion of 
a strong acid (in this case Cl-) are neither acids nor bases and, therefore, have no 
appreciable effect on pH. 
 (Section 16.9)
 4. After equivalence point: The pH of the solution after the equivalence point is 
determined by the concentration of excess NaOH in the solution. This calculation is 
illustrated in Sample Exercise 17.7(b).

Calculate the pH when (a) 49.0 mL and (b) 51.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH solution have been added to 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl solution.

(a) The number of moles of H+ in the original 
HCl solution is given by the product of the 
volume of th
