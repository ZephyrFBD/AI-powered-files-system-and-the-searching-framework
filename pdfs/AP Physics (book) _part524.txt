the same laws (not recognized previously). For this
reason, and also because Newton integrated the results of earlier scientists into
his system, we sometimes speak of Newton’s synthesis.
The laws formulated by Newton are referred to as causal laws. By causality we
mean that one occurrence can cause another. When a rock strikes a window, we infer
the rock causes the window to break.This idea of “cause and effect”relates to Newton’s
laws: the acceleration of an object was seen to be caused by the net force acting on it.
As a result of Newton’s theories, the universe came to be viewed by many as
a machine whose parts move in a deterministic way. This deterministic view of the
universe had to be modified in the twentieth century (Chapter 28).
Sun Earth Reference Frames
The geocentric–heliocentric controversy (page 125) may be seen today as a matter of
frame of reference. From the reference frame of Earth, we see the Sun and Moon
as revolving around us with average periods of 24 h (
