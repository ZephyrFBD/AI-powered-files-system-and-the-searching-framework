Look at each of the processes shown, and decide if it is endergonic or exergonic. In each case, does enthalpy increase
or decrease, and does entropy increase or decrease?
a.
Compost pile decomposition is endergonic, enthalpy increases and entropy increases. A baby developing
from egg is an endergonic process, enthalpy decreases and entropy decreases. Sand art being destroyed
is exergonic, no change in enthalpy and entropy increases. A ball rolling downhill is exergonic process,
enthalpy decreases and no change in entropy.
