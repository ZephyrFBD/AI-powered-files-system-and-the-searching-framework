ESTIMATE
In addition to stars both within and outside the Milky Way, we can see by
telescope many faint cloudy patches in the sky which were all referred to once as
“nebulae” (Latin for “clouds”). A few of these, such as those in the constellations
Andromeda and Orion, can actually be discerned with the naked eye on a clear
night. Some are star clusters (Fig. 33–3), groups of stars that are so numerous
they appear to be a cloud. Others are glowing clouds of gas or dust (Fig. 33–4),
and it is for these that we now mainly reserve the word nebula.
Most fascinating are those that belong to a third category: they often have
fairly regular elliptical shapes. Immanuel Kant (about 1755) guessed they are faint
because they are a great distance beyond our Galax
