egulate the opening and 
closing of stomata. 
In this laboratory investigation, you will begin by calculating leaf surface area and 
then determine the average number of stomata per square millimeter. From your data, 
several questions emerge about the process of transpiration in plants, including the 
following: 
•  Do all plants have stomata? Is there any relationship between the number of stomata 
and the environment in which the plant species evolved? 
•  Are leaf surface area and the number of stomata related to the rate of transpiration? 
What might happen to the rate of transpiration if the number of leaves or the size of 
leaves is reduced? 
•  Do all parts of a plant transpire? 
•  Do all plants transpire at the same rate? Is there a relationship between the habitat in 
which plants evolved and their rate of transpiration? 
•  What other factors, including environmental variables, might contribute to the rate of 
transpiration? 
•  What structural features and/or physiological
