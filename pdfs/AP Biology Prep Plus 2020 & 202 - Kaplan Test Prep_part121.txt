It is important to understand that DDT-resistant mosquitoes in sub-
Saharan Africa were the only ones that were able to survive aȇer DDT
exposure in the 1950s and have been continually reproducing, passing
on the trait for DDT resistance. This mechanism of natural selection
allowed mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa to maintain this trait for
DDT resistance for more than 60 years. (D) is thus correct. The
concentration of DDT is irrelevant, since the mosquitoes already have
the trait for DDT resistance, which indicates that the DDT is unable to
attack sodium channels. Therefore, no matter how much DDT is used,
it will never be able to aﬀect its target site, making (A) incorrect. Recall
that mosquitoes fit the criteria for r-selected species: they have short
lifespans, small body sizes, and reproduce quickly, producing many
oﬀspring. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they w
