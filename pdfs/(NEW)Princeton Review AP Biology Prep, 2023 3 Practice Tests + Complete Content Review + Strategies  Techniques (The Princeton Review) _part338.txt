sion is to turn it into RNA. The RNA is then sent out into the cell and often gets turned
into a protein. Proteins are the biggest group of “worker-molecules,” and most expressed DNA turns into proteins.
These proteins, in turn, regulate almost everything that occurs in the cell.
The process of making an RNA from DNA is called transcription, and the process of making a protein from an
RNA is called translation. In eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the nucleus (where the DNA is kept), and
translation takes place in the cytoplasm.
Obviously, in prokaryotes, both occur in the cytoplasm because prokaryotes don’t contain a nucleus; this allows
transcription and translation to occur at the same time.
The flow of genetic information, the Central Dogma of Biology, is therefore:
Word Connection
A dogma is a core belief or set of ideas. Since this flow of information from
DNA to RNA to protein is so important for understanding the workings of living
things, it has been dubbed the Ce
