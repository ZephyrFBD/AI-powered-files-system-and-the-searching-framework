he ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy and has near-maximal kinetic energy. Other examples of
potential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam (Figure 6.6), or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.
Figure 6.6 Water behind a dam has potential energy. Moving water, such as in a waterfall or a rapidly flowing river, has
kinetic energy. (credit “dam”: modification of work by "Pascal"/Flickr; credit “waterfall”: modification of work by Frank

Potential energy is not only associated with the location of matter (such as a child sitting on a tree branch), but also with the
structure of matter. A spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled taut.
The very existence of living cells relies heavily on structural potential energy. On a chemical level, the bonds that hold the
atoms of molecules together have potential energy. Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize
