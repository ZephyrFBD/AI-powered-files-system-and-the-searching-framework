hing soda, a compound used to prepare hard water for 
washing laundry, is a hydrate, which means that a certain 
number of water molecules are included in the solid struc-
ture. Its formula can be written as Na2CO3 # xH2O, where x is 
the number of moles of H2O per mole of Na2CO3. When a 
2.558-g sample of washing soda is heated at 125 °C, all the 
water of hydration is lost, leaving 0.948 g of Na2CO3. What is 
the value of x?
 3.60  Epsom salts, a strong laxative used in veterinary medicine, 
is a hydrate, which means that a certain number of water 
molecules are included in the solid structure. The formula 
for Epsom salts can be written as MgSO4 # xH2O, where x 
indicates the number of moles of H2O per mole of MgSO4. 
When 5.061 g of this  
hydrate is heated to 250 °C, all the wa-
ter of hydration is lost, leaving 2.472 g of MgSO4. What is 
the value of x?
