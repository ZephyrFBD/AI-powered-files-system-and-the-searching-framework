acid are nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and nitrocellulose. The following reaction 
occurs when nitroglycerin explodes:
 
4 C3H5N3O91l2 ¡ 6 N21g2 + 12 CO21g2 + 10 H2O1g2 + O21g2 
[22.42]
All the products of this reaction contain very strong bonds and are gases. As a result, the 
reaction is very exothermic, and the volume of the products is far larger than the volume 
occupied by the reactant. Thus, the expansion resulting from the heat generated by the 
reaction produces the explosion.

During the 1870s, an interesting observation was made in Alfred 
Nobel’s dynamite factories. Workers who suffered from heart disease 
that caused chest pains when they exerted themselves found relief 
from the pains during the workweek. It quickly became apparent 
that nitroglycerin, present in the air of the factory, acted to enlarge 
blood vessels. Thus, this powerfully explosive ch
