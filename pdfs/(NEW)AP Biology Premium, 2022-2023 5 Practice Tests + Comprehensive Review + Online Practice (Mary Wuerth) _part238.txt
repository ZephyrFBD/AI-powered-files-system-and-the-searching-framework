utations in the gene for adenylyl cyclase can interfere with a cellâ€™s ability to produce the secondary messenger
cAMP, disrupting all steps in the signal transduction process that are dependent on that secondary messenger. A
disruption to any step in the signal transduction process will affect not only that step but will also affect any
subsequent steps in the process that are dependent on the products of the previous steps.
Feedback Mechanisms
Feedback mechanisms are important to living organisms because they help living organisms respond to changes in
the environment while maintaining the internal environment of the cell. (See Figure 10.6.) Cell communication and
signaling are crucial in feedback mechanisms.
Negative feedback returns a system to its original condition and helps maintain homeostasis (the maintenance of
a stable state). For example, if the body temperature becomes too elevated, cell signaling processes will trigger skin
cells to release sweat, which will cool the body
