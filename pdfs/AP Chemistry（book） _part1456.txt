MOs that are perpendicular to each other like the 2p orbitals from which 
they were made. These p*
2p orbitals have four lobes, pointing away from the two nuclei, as 
shown in Figure 9.36.
The 2pz orbitals on two atoms point directly at each other. Hence, overlap of two 
2pz orbitals is greater than that of two 2px or 2py orbitals. We therefore expect the s
2p MO 
to be lower in energy (more stable) than the p
2p MOs. Similarly, the s*
2p MO should be 
higher in energy (less stable) than the p*
2p MOs.

Our discussion of atomic orbitals in Chapter 6 and molecular orbitals 
in this chapter highlights some of the most important applications 
of quantum mechanics in chemistry. In the quantum-mechanical
