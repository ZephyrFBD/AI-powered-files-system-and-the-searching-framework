13. In Drosophila (fruit flies), eye color is on the X chromosome. Male flies have an X and a Y chromosome, and
female flies have two X chromosomes.
(a) A red-eyed male fly is mated with a white-eyed female fly. All the resulting female offspring have red
eyes, and all the resulting male offspring have white eyes. Explain which trait, red eyes or white eyes, is
dominant and why. Draw a Punnett square to support your answer.
(b) Scientists have discovered that white-eyed flies have a mutation in the enzyme TRY 2,3-dioxygenase
(TDO2). TDO2 mutations prevent the accumulation of kynurenine, a compound associated with aging.
White-eyed flies and red-eyed flies were raised under identical conditions, and the mean life span of both
type of flies was recorded. Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in that
experiment.
(c) The data from the experiment described in part (b) are
