of photosynthesis. Understanding
the role of mycorrhizae in plant growth will give you an example
of the interdependence of organisms within an ecosystem. How
plants load and carry sucrose inside phloem vessels is an important
example of active transport. Understanding how water and
nutrients travel through xylem will help you to understand Lab #11.
The material about hormones in this chapter is a good example of
one of the College Board’s favorite topics—cell communication.
Plants use signal transduction pathways for the same reason as do
organisms in other kingdoms. These pathways amplify a specific
signal from inside or outside a cell. Another important concept put
forth by the College Board is that the timing and coordination of
physiological events are regulated by multiple mechanisms.
Photoperiodism is a great example of that.
