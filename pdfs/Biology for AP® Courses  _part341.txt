causing no change in the DNA structure.
b.
The DNA will bulge in the places where cytosine is replaced by adenine.
c.
The adenine substituted in the place of cytosine will get methylated and will not be transcribed further.
d.
The DNA will cause another mutation to replace this incorrect DNA base.
RNA
Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of DNA. RNA is
usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the
RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.
There are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and
microRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a
cell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned “on” and the messen
