a.
The DNA is cut into fragments, sequencing is
done using the chain termination method,
fragments are analyzed to see the overlapping
sequences, and the entire fragment is reformed.
b.
The DNA is cut into fragments, overlapping
sequences are analyzed using a computer,
sequencing is done using the chain termination
method, and the DNA fragment is reformed.
c.
The DNA is cut into fragments, stained with
fluorescent dye, sequenced using the chain
termination method, fragments are analyzed to
see the overlapping sequences, and the entire
DNA fragment is reformed.
d.
The DNA is cut into fragments, sequencing is
done using the chain termination method, the
DNA is stained with fluorescent dye, and a
computer is used to analyze and reform the
entire DNA fragment.
