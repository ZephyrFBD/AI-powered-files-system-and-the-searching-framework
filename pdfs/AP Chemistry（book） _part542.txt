 most important of 
these solutions. For example, when HCl(g) dissolves in water to form HCl(aq), the mole-
cule ionizes; that is, it dissociates into H+1aq2 and Cl-1aq2 ions.
Strong and Weak electrolytes
Electrolytes differ in the extent to which they conduct electricity. Strong electrolytes 
are those solutes that exist in solution completely or nearly completely as ions. Essen-
tially all water-soluble ionic compounds (such as NaCl) and a few molecular compounds 
(such as HCl) are strong electrolytes. Weak electrolytes are those solutes that exist in 
solution mostly in the form of neutral molecules with only a small fraction in the form 
of ions. For example, in a solution of acetic acid 1CH3COOH2, most of the solute is pres-
ent as CH3COOH1aq2 molecules. Only a small fraction (about 1%) of the CH3COOH has 
dissociated into H+1aq2 and CH3COO-1aq2 ions.*
We must be careful not to confuse the extent to which an electrolyte dissolves (its 
solubility) with whether it is strong or weak
