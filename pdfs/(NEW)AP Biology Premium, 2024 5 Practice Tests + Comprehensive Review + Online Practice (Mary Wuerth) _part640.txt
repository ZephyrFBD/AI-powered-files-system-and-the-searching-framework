Questions 31 and 32
The ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) is a dominant trait. Nontasters of PTC are recessive. In a population
that is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, there are 520 homozygous dominant tasters, 400 heterozygous tasters,
and 80 nontasters of PTC.

(B) 0.44
(C) 0.56
(D) 0.72
32. What is the frequency of individuals who are carriers of the nontasting allele?
(A) 0.08
(B) 0.40
(C) 0.50
(D) 0.52
