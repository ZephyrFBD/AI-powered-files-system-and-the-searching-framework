hybridization The mathematical mixing of different types of 
atomic orbitals to produce a set of equivalent hybrid orbitals. 
(Section 9.5)
hybrid orbital An orbital that results from the mixing of 
different kinds of atomic orbitals on the same atom. For 
example, an sp3 hybrid results from the mixing, or hybridizing, 
of one s orbital and three p orbitals. (Section 9.5)
hydration Solvation when the solvent is water. (Section 13.1)
hydride ion An ion formed by the addition of an electron to a 
hydrogen atom: H-. (Section 7.7)
hydrocarbons Compounds composed of only carbon and 
hydrogen. (Section 2.9)
hydrogen bonding Bonding that results from intermolecular 
attractions between molecules containing hydrogen bonded 
to an electronegative element. The most imp
