4.2.2 Comprehensive evaluation model
Since we have already processed the data, we need to balance the weight of three
key indexes according to their influences to the efficiency of the strategy as well as
the social factors. We assume that

for the weight the corresponding index have.
Finally we use the comprehensive evaluation model to calculate the less
efficiency of the strategy:
