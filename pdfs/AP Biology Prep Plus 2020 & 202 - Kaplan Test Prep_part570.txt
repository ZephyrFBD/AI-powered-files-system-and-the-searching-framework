 of an antisense strand. (D) is incorrect because it
provides the sequence if the mRNA strand were read from 3′ to 5′, but
this is the opposite of the direction of reading in translation.

Learning Objective: 13.6
Because phosphorylation directly modifies existing proteins, it must
be regulated aȇer translation occurs, making it a post-translational
modification. Therefore, (D) is correct. (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect
because these are all processes that occur before a protein has been
constructed.
7. C
Learning Objective: 13.7
The enzyme would break the plasmid at the points labeled “HaeIII” in
the diagram. This would create two fragments, one with a length of
900 base pairs and the other with a length of 400 + 700 = 1,100 base
pairs. (C) is thus correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect because they fail to
account for the total length of one of the strands. (D) is incorrect
because it presents the results if both HaeIII and EcoRI were used.
