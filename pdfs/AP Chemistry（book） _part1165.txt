elements are metals; they occupy the left side and the middle 
of the periodic table. Nonmetals appear in the upper-right section 
of the table. Metalloids occupy a narrow band between the metals 
and nonmetals. The tendency of an element to exhibit the prop-
erties of metals, called the metallic character, increases as we pro-
ceed down a column and decreases as we proceed from left to right 
across a row.
Metals have a characteristic luster, and they are good conduc-
tors of heat and electricity. When metals react with nonmetals, the 
metal atoms are oxidized to cations and ionic substances are gen-
erally formed. Most metal oxides are basic; they react with acids to 
form salts and water.
Nonmetals lack metallic luster and are generally poor conduc-
tors of heat and electricity. Several are gases at room temperature. 
Compounds composed entirely of nonmetals are generally molec-
ular. Nonmetals usually form anions in their reactions with metals. 
Nonmetal oxides are acidic; they rea
