tube of uniform diameter, but
we must remember that it is now air itself that is vibrating. We can describe the
waves either in terms of the flow of the air—that is, in terms of the displacement
of air—or in terms of the pressure in the air (see Figs. 12–2 and 12–3). In terms of
displacement, the air at the closed end of a tube is a displacement node since the
air is not free to move there, whereas near the open end of a tube there will be 
an antinode because the air can move freely in and out. The air within the tube
vibrates in the form of longitudinal standing waves. A few of the possible modes
of vibration for a tube open at both ends (called an open tube) are shown graphi-
cally in Fig. 12–11. Possible vibration modes for a tube that is open at one end but
closed at the other (called a closed tube) are shown in Fig. 12–12. [A tube closed
at both ends, having no connection to the outside air, would be useless as an
instrument.] The graphs in part (a) of each Figure (left-hand side
