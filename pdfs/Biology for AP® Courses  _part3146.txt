26.2 How Neurons Communicate
Neurons have charged membranes because there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside of the cell. Voltage-
gated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron. When a neuronal membrane is depolarized to at
least the threshold of excitation, an action potential is fired. The action potential is then propagated along a myelinated
axon to the axon terminals. In a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into
the synaptic cleft. Through binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane. In electrical
synapses, the action potential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctionsâ€”large channel
