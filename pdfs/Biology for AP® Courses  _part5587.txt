Transgender = transhumanism
When something explodes out of nowhere and is suddenly
everywhere it is always the Cult agenda and so it is with the tidal
wave of claims and demands that have inﬁltrated every aspect of
society under the heading of ‘transgenderism’. The term ‘trans’ is so
‘in’ and this is the dictionary deﬁnition:
A prefix meaning ‘across’, ’through’, occurring … in loanwords from Latin, used in particular
for denoting movement or conveyance from place to place (transfer; transmit; transplant) or
complete change (transform; transmute), or to form adjectives meaning ’crossing’, ‘on the
other side of’, or ‘going beyond’ the place named (transmontane; transnational; trans-
Siberian).
Transgender means to go beyond gender and transhuman means
to go beyond human. Both are aspects of the Cult plan to transform
the human body to a synthetic state with no gender. Human 2.0 is not
designed to procreate and would be produced technologically with
no need for parents
