r and phosphate groups with the bases extending off the chain 
as side groups (Figure 24.26). The carbons in the sugars are numbered 
1′, 2′, and so forth, as shown in Figure 24.26. Just as proteins have 
a sequence of amino acids from the N terminus to the C terminus, 
nucleic acids have a sequence of bases that start from the 5′ end of 
the sugar-phosphate backbone and go to the 3′ end.
The DNA strands wind together in an antiparallel double helix 
(Figure 24.27(a)). The two strands are held together by attractions 
between bases (represented by T, A, C, and G). These attractions involve 
dispersion forces, dipole–dipole forces, and hydrogen bonds. 
 (Sec-
tion 11.2) As shown in Figure 24.27(b), the structures of thymine and 
adenine make them perfect partners for hydrogen bonding. Likewise, 
cytosine and guanine form ideal hydrogen-bonding partners. We say 
that thymine and adenine are complementary to each other and cyto-
sine and guanine are complementary to each other. In the dou
