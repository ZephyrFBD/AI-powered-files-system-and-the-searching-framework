16–8 Electric Field Lines
Since the electric field is a vector, it is sometimes referred to as a vector field. We
could indicate the electric field with arrows at various points in a given situation,
such as at A, B, and C in Fig. 16–30. The directions of 
and 
are the
same as for the forces shown earlier in Fig. 16–23, but the magnitudes (arrow
lengths) are different since we divide 
by q to get 
However, the relative
lengths of 
and 
are the same as for the forces since we divide by the
same q each time. To indicate the electric field in such a way at many points,
however, would result in many arrows, which would quickly become cluttered and
confusing. To avoid this, we use another technique, that of field lines.
To visualize the electric field, we draw a series of lines to indicate the direction
of the electric field at various points in space. These electric field lines (or lines of
force) are drawn to indicate the direction of the force due t
