ater potential than
seawater that has an NaCl concentration of 0.45 moles per liter. So water would flow out of the human cells into
the seawater with the lower water potential. Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect because the human cells would
have a higher water potential than the seawater. Choice (D) incorrectly states that NaCl would flow out of the
human cells; it is in fact water that would flow out of the human cells.
10. (B) The water potential of a 0.1 molar NaCl solution at 21°C is –4.88 bars, which is calculated as follows:
Since the dandelion root cells have a water potential of –1.2 bars, water would flow from the higher water
potential in the dandelion root cells into the lower water potential of the NaCl solution. Choice (A) is incorrect
because if NaCl moved into the dandelion cells, it would lower, not raise, the water potential of those cells. The
dandelion cells are open to the atmosphere and have a pressure potential of 0, but choice (C) fails to take into
account the
