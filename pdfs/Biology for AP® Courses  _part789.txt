An intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates
(such as ATP) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving ATP, ATP is one of the substrates
and ADP is a product. During an endergonic chemical reaction, ATP forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and
enzyme in the reaction. This intermediate complex allows the ATP to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy,
to the substrate, a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate (~P). This is
illustrated by the following generic reaction:
A + enzyme + ATP → 
⎡
⎣A − enzyme − ∼P
⎤
⎦ → B + enzyme + ADP + phosphate ion
When the intermediate complex breaks apart, the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a product of the
reaction. The ADP molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are available for recycling through
cell metabolism.
