Moral Value
Finally, it has been argued that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. A chief proponent of this
idea is entomologist E. O. Wilson. He argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to live in a natural environment
and that built environments generate stressors that affect human health and well-being. There is considerable research into
the psychological regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold some truth. In addition,
there is a moral argument that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other species.
