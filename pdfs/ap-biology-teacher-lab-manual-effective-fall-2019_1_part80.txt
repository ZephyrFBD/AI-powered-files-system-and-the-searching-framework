liar activities, especially if you and your students are just 
beginning to use more student-directed, inquiry-based laboratory investigations. 
For example, use common substances (such as tomatoes, apples, or radishes) and 
have students make observations that lead to a question. Students typically can find 
something interesting about something familiar within ten minutes of observation. 
Follow up by having students develop a question about that observation. Questions 
can be as simple as Where is the red color located in a tomato? and How do the colors of 
a tomato change?, or How will I know if the tomatoes ripen faster? and How do I define 
“ripen”? Help students determine how they might go about investigating their questions. 
Simple questions may lead to other questions and hypotheses that can be investigated 
through experiments.
