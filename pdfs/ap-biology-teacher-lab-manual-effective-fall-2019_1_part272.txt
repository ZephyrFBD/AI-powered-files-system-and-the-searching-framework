b. Draw a cladogram depicting the evolutionary relationships among all five species 
(including humans) according to their percentage similarity in the GAPDH gene. 
Online Activities 
You can also prepare for the lab by working through the following online activities: 
• “The Evolution of Flight in Birds”

This activity provides a real-world example of how cladograms are used to 
understand evolutionary relationships.

■ Procedure 
A team of scientists has uncovered the fossil specimen in Figure 3 near Liaoning 
Province, China.  Make some general observations about the morphology (physical 
structure) of the fossil, and then record your observations in your notebook.
