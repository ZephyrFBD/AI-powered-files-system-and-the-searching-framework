s on
another species with which it competes. This
species must also develop an advantage or it will
be outcompeted. The two species “run [evolve]
to stay in the same place.”
c.
When one species develops a mutation that
decreases its ability to survive, a competing
species will become better able to survive even
though it has not changed in any way. In effect,
this species “runs [evolves] to stay in the same
place.”
d.
When two asexually reproducing species
encounter rapid environmental change, the
species that is also able to reproduce sexually
will outcompete the other. This way it can “run
[evolve] to stay in the same place.”
