Alternate approach: ©Q = 0
Alternate Solution,
.
APPROACH We use Eq. 14–3,
SOLUTION For each term,
If 
then 
Equation 14–3,
becomes
The second term is negative because T will be less than 95°C. Solving the algebra
gives the same result, T = 86°C.
mcupccup(T - 25°C) + mteactea(T - 95°C) = 0.

EXAMPLE 14;4'
You are free to use either approach. They are entirely equivalent, alge-
braically. For example, if you move the first term in the displayed equation of the
alternate Example 14–4 over to the other side of the equals sign, you obtain the
“
” equation in the first version of Example 14–4.
heat lost = heat gained
