The world around us follows a hierarchy of organization. All life on Earth
is connected, from the smallest individual units of matter (atoms and
molecules) to complex organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss the
basic building blocks that compose the living world. Although some
organisms are more complex than others, diï¬€erent levels of organization
do not correlate with levels of complexity. An individual cell with its
multitude of chemical reactions is just as dynamic and complex as an
entire community of species. This chapter will review the most crucial
concepts of the building blocks of life.
ELEMENTS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE
Ninety-nine percent of all living matter is made up of only four elements.
These elements are nitrogen (N), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen
(O). Phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) account for almost all of the remaining
1 percent of living matter. All six elements are important in biochemistry,
especially carbon (C).
