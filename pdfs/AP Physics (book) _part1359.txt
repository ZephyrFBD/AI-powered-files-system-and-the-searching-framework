. Model the hallway as a tube closed at both ends.
43. (III) When a player’s finger presses a guitar string down
onto a fret, the length of the vibrating portion of the string
is shortened, thereby increasing the string’s fundamental
frequency (see Fig.12–36). The string’s tension and mass per
unit length remain unchanged. If the unfingered length of
the string is 
determine the positions x of the
first six frets, if each fret raises the pitch of the fundamental
by one musical note compared to the neighboring fret. On
the equally tempered
chromatic scale, the
ratio of frequencies
of neighboring notes
is 2112.

33. (II) An unfingered guitar string is 0.68 m long and is tuned
to play E above middle C (330 Hz). (a) How far from the
end of this string must a fret (and your finger) be placed to
play A above middle C (440 Hz)? (b) What is the wave-
length on the string of this 440-Hz wave? (c) What are the
