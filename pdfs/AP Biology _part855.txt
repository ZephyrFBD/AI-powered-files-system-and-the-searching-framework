CHI-SQUARE TABLE
Calculate the critical value by using the chi-square equation. For one
degree of freedom, if your chi-square value (p) is less than the critical
value of 3.84, the difference in observed results from expected results is
due merely to chance and not to experimental error. (Good thing.) If the χ2
value exceeds the 0.05 value 3.84 for one degree of freedom, then the
variation from the expected is due to experimental error. (Bad thing.) For
two degrees of freedom, the critical value is 5.99.
The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between
the observed and expected frequencies. Once you have determined your
critical value from the Chi-Square Table, you can either:
Fail to reject the null hypothesis—If the chi-square value is less than the
critical value, you accept or fail to reject (the odd but correct terminology)
the null hypothesis, meaning the difference
