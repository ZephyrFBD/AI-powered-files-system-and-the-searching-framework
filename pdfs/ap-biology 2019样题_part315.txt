Figure 1. Effect of pH on the activity of trypsin
Which of the following statements best explains the activity levels of trypsin shown 
in Figure 1?
(A) The small intestine releases inhibitor molecules that block the activity of 
trypsin unless it is at its optimum pH.
(B) The number of effective collisions between trypsin and its substrate increase 
at higher pH values.
(C) As pH values increase, the substrate concentration decreases, leading to an 
eventual decline in the rate of the trypsin-catalyzed re
