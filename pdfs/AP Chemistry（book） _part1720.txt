ch case that 
the H atom in the hydrogen bond interacts with a nonbonding electron pair.
Hydrogen bonds can be considered a special type of dipoleâ€“dipole attraction. 
Because N, O, and F are so electronegative, a bond between hydrogen and any of these 
elements is quite polar, with hydrogen at the positive end (remember the + on the right-
hand side of the dipole symbol represents the positive end of the dipole):
H
N
H
O
H
F
The hydrogen atom has no inner electrons. Thus, the positive side of the dipole has 
the concentrated charge of the nearly bare hydrogen nucleus. This positive charge is 
attracted to the negative charge of an electronegative atom in a nearby molecule. Because 
the electron-poor hydrogen is so small, it can approach an electronegative atom very 
closely and, thus, interact strongly with it.
Hydrogen bonding plays important roles in many chemical systems, especially those of 
biological significance. For example, hydrogen bonding helps stabilize the three-dimensiona
