imate material to occupy the same amount of space/weight.
1 pt: The control variables (treatments) are the dry live seeds and the beads. (Note: The experimental treatment is the
live seeds.)
1 pt: Provide a mechanism to deal with confounding factors. In the experiment described here (and in the AP lab),
KOH is added to
the apparatus in order to absorb released CO2, which would otherwise make an accurate measurement of O2 uptake
impossible.
1 pt: Provide a brief description of the apparatus and procedure. For
this example, respirometers are used to measure gas uptake. A
respirometer is a vessel (or test tube) that can be sealed and has a
device to measure changes in pressure inside (test tube with pipette sealed to opening with a rubber stopper or a
capillary tube attached to a syringe).
c. expected results (2 points maximum)
1 pt: Experimental treatment: Pressure inside the vessel with the
soaked, germinating seeds decreases.
1 pt: Control treatments: No change in the pressure inside t
