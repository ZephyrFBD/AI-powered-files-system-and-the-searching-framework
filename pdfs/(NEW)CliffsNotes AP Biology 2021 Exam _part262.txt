gin. In the 16
boxes of the square, alleles from gametes at the top and left are combined. By convention, both alleles from the
color gene are arranged together (for example, Y and y), and both alleles of the texture gene are arranged together
(for example, R and r). The next step is to list each kind of genotype and count the number of times each genotype
appears. This information is shown at the right side of Figure 8-5. The final step is to identify the phenotype of each
genotype and to count how many times each phenotype appears. You will see that some phenotypes have more than
one genotype. For example, YYRR, YYRr, YyRR, and YyRr all code for a yellow and round seed. The conclusion is
that the F2progeny consist of nine plants with yellow and round seeds, three plants with green and round seeds, three
plants with yellow and wrinkled seeds, and one plant with green and wrinkled seeds. This ratio, 9:3:3:1, is the same
ratio Mendel observed in his experiments for this dihybrid cross.
