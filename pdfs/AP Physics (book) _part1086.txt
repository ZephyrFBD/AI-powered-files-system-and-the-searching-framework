 be surprising, however,
that Q also depends on the fourth power of the tube’s radius. This means that for
the same pressure gradient, if the tube radius is halved, the flow rate is decreased
by a factor of 16! Thus the rate of flow, or alternately the pressure required to
maintain a given flow rate, is greatly affected by only a small change in tube radius.
An interesting example of this 
dependence is blood flow in the human
body. Poiseuille’s equation is valid only for the streamline flow of an incompres-
sible fluid. So it cannot be precisely accurate for blood whose flow is not without
turbulence and that contains blood cells (whose diameter is almost equal to that
of a capillary). Nonetheless, Poiseuille’s equation does give a reasonable first
approximation. Because the radius of arteries is reduced as a result of arterioscle-
rosis (thickening and hardening of artery walls, Fig. 10–32) and by cholesterol
buildup, the pressure gradient must be increased to maintain the same flow
