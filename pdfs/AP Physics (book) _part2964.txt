nctioning of clocks. What then
does it deal with?
7. Does time dilation mean that time actually passes more
slowly in moving reference frames or that it only seems to
pass more slowly?
8. A young-looking woman astronaut has just arrived home
from a long trip. She rushes up to an old gray-haired man
and in the ensuing conversation refers to him as her son.
How might this be possible?
9. If you were traveling away from Earth at speed 0.6c, would
you notice a change in your heartbeat? Would your mass,
height, or waistline change? What would observers on
Earth using telescopes say about you?
10. Do time dilation and length contraction occur at ordinary
speeds, say 
11. Suppose the speed of light were infinite. What would
happen to the relativistic predictions of length contraction
and time dilation?
90 kmh?
12. Explain how the length contraction and time dilation for-
mulas might be used to indicate that c is the limiting speed
in the universe.
13. Discuss how our everyday lives would be
