 to
overuse of antibiotics in chickens. As a result, these ciprofloxacin-
resistant Camplobacter were selected for, surviving the treatment of
ciprofloxacin and continuing to multiply, allowing for ciprofloxacin
resistance to occur more rapidly than normal. (A) is thus correct. (B) is
incorrect because the proportion of ciprofloxacin-resistant
Camplobacter would increase aȇer treatment with ciprofloxacin. (C) is
incorrect because there is no evidence that ciprofloxacin would aﬀect
growth and division; the role of antibiotics is to eradicate disease-
causing bacteria, not to slow persistence in the population. (D) is
incorrect because it does not address the issue of rapid ciprofloxacin
resistance in the population; the new strains of Camplobacter may or
may not be ciprofloxacin-resistant since they are unexposed to the
antibiotic, yielding no additional information on increased
ciprofloxacin resistance.
