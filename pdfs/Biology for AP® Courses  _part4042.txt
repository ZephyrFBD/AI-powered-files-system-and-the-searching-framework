lowing internal fertilization. In oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the
female’s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg. This occurs in most bony
fish, many reptiles, some cartilaginous fish, most amphibians, two mammals, and all birds. Reptiles and insects produce
leathery eggs, while birds and turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them
hard. Chicken eggs are an example of this second type.
In ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg’s yolk and
the young are fully developed when they are hatched. This occurs in some bony fish (like the guppy Lebistes reticulatus),
some sharks, some lizards, some snakes (such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate
animals (like the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa).
In viviparity the young develop within the female, recei
