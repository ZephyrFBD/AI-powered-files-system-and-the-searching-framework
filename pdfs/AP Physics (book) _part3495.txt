OTE This 45-mrem effective dose is almost 50% of the normal allowed dose
for a whole year 
or 1% of the maximum one-year allowance for
radiation workers. This worker should not receive such a large dose every day
and should seek ways to reduce it (shield the source, vary the work, work
farther from the source, work less time this close to source, etc.).
We have assumed that the intensity of radiation decreases as the square of the
distance. It actually falls off faster than 
because of absorption in the air, so
our answers are a slight overestimate of dose received.
Radon exposure. In the U.S., yearly deaths from radon
exposure (the second leading cause of lung cancer) are estimated to exceed 
the yearly deaths from drunk driving. The Environmental Protection Agency
recommends taking action to reduce the radon concentration in living areas if it
exceeds 
of air. In some areas 50% of houses exceed this level from nat-
urally occurring radon in the soil. Estimate (a) the number of decays
