r. (Why should the tubing  
be free of air bubbles? Why must the  
stem be completely immersed in the  
water?) If using a gas pressure sensor,  
the tubing is inserted directly into the  
device, with no pipettes required. (The  
potometer assembly is illustrated in  
Figure 2.) 
  
• Fan, heat lamp, water, small plastic  
bag, spray bottle with water, salt, and  
other materials provided by your  
teacher to simulate an environmental  
variable  
•  Petroleum jelly to make an airtight 
seal between the cut end of stem and 
tubing filled with water (You can also 
use small clamps to seal without the 
“goop.”)

Figure 2. Potometer Assembly 
Using a razor blade, carefully cut the plant stem so that its diameter will fit into the piece 
of plastic tubing in the potometer assembly. Note that it is often helpful to cut the stem 
while it is submer
