In between we find silicon and germanium, both of which have the same ar-
rangement of atoms as diamond and are semiconductors used extensively in 
integrated circuits and computers. Tin has a split personality in the sense that 
it behaves as a metal at temperatures above 13 °C (b-Sn or white tin) and as a 
semiconductor below 13 °C (a-Sn or gray tin).
In this chapter, we explore several fundamental characteristics of 
elements. We see how these characteristics change as we move across a 
row or down a column of the periodic table, which in turn helps us ratio-
nalize and predict the physical and chemical properties of the elements.
7.1 ∣ Development of the Periodic Table
The discovery of chemical elements has been ongoing since ancient times (Figure 7.1). 
Certain elements, such as gold (Au), appear in nature in elemental form and were thus 
 
discovered thousands of years ago. In contrast, some elements, such as technetium 
(Tc), are radioactive and intrinsically unstable. We know a
