Sexual reproduction was an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells. It appears to have
been very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many animals, it is the only mode
of reproduction. And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating
offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. If the parent organism is successfully occupying
a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that
can produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eg
