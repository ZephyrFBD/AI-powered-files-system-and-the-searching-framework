obal warming, we first must talk about the greenhouse
effect. CO2 and water vapor in the atmosphere absorb and retain much of
the light and heat that comes to Earth from the sun. If the greenhouse
effect did not occur, the average temperature on the surface of Earth would
be much colder and life as we know it would not exist. However,
atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by more than 40% during the last
150 years due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Scientists
link increased CO2 levels to global warming. According to NASA, the
past five years are, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record
(since 1880), and 2018 had the fourth highest mean temperature yet.
The region where global warming has already had a great impact is in
the far north, which includes the Arctic tundra and northern coniferous
forests. As temperatures rise, snow and ice melt, uncovering darker and
more absorbent surfaces. As a result, more radiation is absorbed and Earth
is warmed even more
