ne explanation is that
the person’s foot exerts a force on the platform. Another explanation (and this 
is the most useful analysis here) is that this is an example of the conservation of
angular momentum. If the person starts walking counterclockwise, the person’s
angular momentum will point upward along the axis of rotation (remember 
how we defined the direction of 
using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of
the person’s angular momentum will be 
where v is the
person’s speed (relative to the Earth, not to the platform), r is his distance from
the rotation axis, m is his mass, and 
is his moment of inertia if we consider
him a particle (mass concentrated at one point, Eq.8–11). The platform rotates in the
opposite direction, so its angular momentum points downward. If the total 
angular momentum of the system is initially zero (person and platform at rest),
it will remain zero after the person starts walking. That is, the upward angular
momentum of the person just balances the opp
