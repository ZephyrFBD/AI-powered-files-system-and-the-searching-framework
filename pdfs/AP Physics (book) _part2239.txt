a stereo or TV set is
connected to the wire leads of the speaker or earbuds. The speaker leads are
connected internally to a coil of wire, which is itself attached to the speaker cone,
Fig. 20–40. The speaker cone is usually made of stiffened cardboard and is
mounted so that it can move back and forth freely (except at its attachment on
the outer edges). A permanent magnet is mounted directly in line with the coil of
wire. When the alternating current of an audio signal flows through the wire coil,
which is free to move within the magnet, the coil experiences a force due to the
magnetic field of the magnet. (The force is to the right at the instant shown in
Fig. 20–40, RHR-2, page 568.) As the current alternates at the frequency of the
audio signal, the coil and attached speaker cone move back and forth at the same
frequency, causing alternate compressions and rarefactions of the adjacent air,
and sound waves are produced. A speaker thus changes electrical energy into
sound energy, and
