cytokines, interleukin-1 (Il-1), and interleukin-2 (Il-2). Because Th cells
have CD4 accessory proteins on their cell surface, they are also referred to
as CD4 cells. See Figure 17.3. The CD4 cells are specifically attacked by
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Cytotoxic T cells, Tc, attack and kill body cells that are infected with
pathogens as well as those that transformed into cancer cells. They do it by
a cell-mediated immune response. An activated cytotoxic T cell
proliferates and differentiates into an effector cell and a memory cell.
Activated Tc cells attack and kill infected cells by releasing perforin (a
protein that forms pores in the target cellâ€™s membrane) and granzymes
(enzymes that break down proteins) that cause the cell to lyse and die. The
infecting microb
