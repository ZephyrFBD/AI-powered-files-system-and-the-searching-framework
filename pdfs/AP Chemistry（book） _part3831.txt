ongest continuous chain of carbons that contains the 
double bond is seven carbons long, so the parent hydrocarbon is 
heptene. Because the double bond begins at carbon 2 (number-
ing from the end closer to the double bond), we have 2-heptene. 
With a methyl group at carbon atom 4, we have 4-methyl- 
2-heptene. The geometrical conﬁguration at the double bond is 
cis (that is, the alkyl groups are bonded to the double bond on 
the same side). Thus, the full name is 4-methyl-cis-2-heptene.
(b) The longest continuous chain containing the triple bond 
has six carbons, so this compound is a derivative of hexyne. 
The triple bond comes after the ﬁrst carbon (numbering from 
the right), making it 1-hexyne. The branch from the hexyne 
chain contains three carbon atoms, making it a propyl group. 
Because this substituent is located on C3 of the hexyne chain, 
the molecule is 3-propyl-1-hexyne.
