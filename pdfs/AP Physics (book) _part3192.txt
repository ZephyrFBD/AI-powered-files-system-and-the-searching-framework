duality and the unavoidable interaction between an observed
object and the observer.
One form of the uncertainty principle states that the
position x and momentum 
of an object cannot both be
measured precisely at the same time. The products of the
uncertainties,
can be no less than 
(28;1)
Another form of the uncertainty principle states that the
energy can be uncertain (or nonconserved) by an amount 
for a time 
where

According to quantum mechanics, the state of an electron in
an atom is specified by four quantum numbers: n,
and 
(1) n, the principal quantum number, can take on any integer
value 
and corresponds to the quantum number
of the old Bohr model;
(2)
the orbital quantum number, can take on values from 0
up to 
(3)
the magnetic quantum number, can take on integer
values from 
to 
(4)
the spin quantum number, can be 
or 
The energy levels in the hydrogen atom depend on n,
whereas in other atoms they depend on n and
The orbital angular momentum of an atom has ma
