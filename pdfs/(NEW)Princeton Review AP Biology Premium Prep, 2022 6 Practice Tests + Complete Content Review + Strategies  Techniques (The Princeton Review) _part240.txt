TP to
make ATP: our investment of two ATP yielded four ATP, for a net gain of two. The ATP molecules generated in
glycolysis are created from combining ADP and an inorganic phosphate with the help of an enzyme.
Electron Carriers
NAD+ + H+ + 2 electrons = NADH
FAD + 2H+ + 2 electrons = FADH2
To carry electrons is to carry energy.
Glycolysis also creates two NADH, which result from the transfer of electrons to the carrier NAD+, which then
becomes NADH. NAD+ and NADH are constantly being turned into each other as electrons are being carried and
then unloaded.
There are four important tidbits to remember regarding glycolysis:
occurs in the cytoplasm
net of 2 ATPs produced
2 pyruvic acids formed
2 NADH produced
Stage 2: Formation of Acetyl-CoA
Pyruvic acid is transported to the mitochondrion. Each pyruvic acid (a three-carbon molecule) is converted to
acetyl-coenzyme A (a two-carbon molecule, usually just called acetyl-CoA) and CO2 is released.
