nt they say could pave the way for gestating humans
outside the womb. Professor Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute
of Science said:
We took mouse embryos from the mother at day five of development, when they are just of
250 cells, and had them in the incubator from day five until day 11, by which point they had
grown all their organs.
By day 11 they make their own blood and have a beating heart, a fully developed brain.
Anybody would look at them and say, ‘this is clearly a mouse foetus with all the
characteristics of a mouse.’ It’s gone from being a ball of cells to being an advanced foetus.
A special liquid is used to nourish embryo cells in a laboratory
dish and they ﬂoat on the liquid to duplicate the ﬁrst stage of
embryonic development. The incubator creates all the right
conditions for its development, Hanna said. The liquid gives the
embryo ‘all the nutrients, hormones and sugars they need’ along
with a custom-made electronic incubator which controls gas
concentration, pressu
