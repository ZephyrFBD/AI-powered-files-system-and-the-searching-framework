 acclimation or improvements in models of
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that control
temperature.
According to the graph, growth is predicted to increase
when acclimation is taken into account and the average
temperature increases of Earth’s surface increases by the
expected 3-5°C. Growth enhancement may be reduced,
however, if respiration increases more rapidly than
photosynthesis, particularly under periods of drought and
stress. Thus, climate warming may result in positive,
negative, or potentially no effect on the free energy
availability in forest ecosystems.
D. In the figure below, the response to temperate change in
terms of the rates of photosynthesis and respiration are
sketched as a function of time from the very short-term
(seconds) to the longer-term (decades) changes.
Acclimation in the laboratory occurs in days. Analyze the
graphs; in the box bounded by a dashed line, sketch curves
for responses of both processes beyond the acclimation
observed in the laborato
