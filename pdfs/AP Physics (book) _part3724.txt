th as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. But what about the universe
as a whole: is it static, or does it change? One of the most important scientific
discoveries of the twentieth century was that distant galaxies are racing away
from us, and that the farther they are from us at a given time, the faster they are
moving away. How astronomers arrived at this astonishing idea, and what it
means for the past history of the universe as well as its future, will occupy us for
the remainder of the book.
Observational evidence that the universe is expanding was first put forth by
Edwin Hubble in 1929. This idea was based on distance measurements of galaxies
(Section 33–3), and determination of their velocities by the Doppler shift of
spectral lines in the light received from them (Fig. 33–20). In Chapter 12 we saw
how the frequency of sound is higher and the wavelength shorter if the source
and observer move toward each other. If the source moves away from the
observer, the frequency
