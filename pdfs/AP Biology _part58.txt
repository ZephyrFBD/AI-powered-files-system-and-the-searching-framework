tergent molecules and the correct reason for it?
Detergent molecules are polar and are therefore able to dissolve
both grease and water.
Detergent molecules are nonpolar and are therefore able to
dissolve in both grease and water.
One end of a detergent molecule is nonpolar in order to
dissolve oily stains, while the other end is polar to dissolve in
the rinse water.

Proteins are formed in a ribosome as amino acids are strung together
in a particular sequence determined by instructions from DNA. Here

function.
In both trials, newly formed polypeptide is released from the
ribosome. In Experiment A, the newly formed polypeptide comes in
contact with a heat shock protein (HSP). In Experiment B, the newly
formed polypeptide is not
