ls, followed by individuals of the two
distinct species. For the case of punctuated
equilibrium, the fossil record would show many
hybrid individuals persisting through several
geological layers.
b.
In the case of gradual speciation, the fossil
record would show the parent species in a single
location, such that the newly diverged species
remained in contact with each other. For the case
of punctuated equilibrium, the fossil record
would show a geographic divide within the
parent species that caused it to diverge into
multiple new species.
c.
In the case of gradual speciation, the fossil
record would show many intermediate forms.
For the case of punctuated equilibrium, the fossil
record would show new forms that persist
essentially unchanged through several geological
layers, then disappear just as a new form
appears.
d.
Gradual speciation would be undetectable in the
fossil record. For the case of punctuated
equilibrium, the fossil record would show a
steady progression of distinct fo
