ned by the wave theory
of light. A soap bubble is a very thin
spherical film filled with air. Light
reflected from the outer and inner
surfaces of this thin film of soapy
water interferes constructively to
produce the bright colors. Which
color we see at any point depends on
the thickness of the soapy water film
at that point and also on the viewing
angle. Near the top of the bubble,
we see a small black area surrounded
by a silver or white area. The
bubble’s thickness is smallest at that
black spot, perhaps only about 30 nm
thick, and is fully transparent (we see
the black background).
We cover fundamental aspects of
the wave nature of light, including
two-slit interference and
interference in thin films.
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
When a thin layer of oil lies on top of water or wet pavement, you can often see
swirls of color. We also see swirls of color on the soap bubble shown above. What
causes these colors?
(a) Additives in the oil or soap reflect various colors.
(b) Che
