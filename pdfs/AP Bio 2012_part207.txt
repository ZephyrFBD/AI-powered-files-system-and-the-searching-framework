6.2: The student can construct explanations of phenomena 
based on evidence produced through scientific practices.
Learning Objective
2.13: The student is able to explain how internal 
membranes and organelles contribute to cell functions.
Characteristics of a 
STRONG Response
Attached ribosome (location and function): 
The student is able to write a coherent paragraph with 
appropriate terminology and elaboration to explain 
how a protein produced on the attached ribosome may 
ultimately end up as a secretory protein excreted from 
the cell for further use by another cell for cell signaling, 
signal transduction, or a particular type of metabolic 
action. Students may also say that the protein may end up 
embedded into the cell membrane as an integral protein 
or peripheral protein. The student could then elaborate on 
how this receptor protein can help in membrane signaling 
or as an enzyme in a metabolic reaction. The student may 
mention that the secretory proteins may also be fou
