mula of Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, come from a single d-d transition 
in each compound. The compounds are sometimes found 
together in nature as shown here. (a) What is the electron 
configuration of the copper ion in each mineral? (b) Based 
on their colors, in which compound would you predict the 
crystal-field splitting âˆ† is larger?
 23.56  The color and wavelength of the absorption maxi-
mum for 3Ni(H2O)642+, 3Ni(NH3)642+, and 3Ni(en)342+ are 
given in Figure 23.30. The absorption maximum for the 
3Ni(bipy)342+ ion occurs at about 520 nm. (a) What color 
would you expect for the 3Ni(bipy)342+ ion? (b) Based on 
these data, where would you put bipy in the spectrochem-
ical series?
 23.57  Give the number of (valence) d electrons associated 
with the central metal ion in each of the following com-
plexes: (a) K33TiCl64, (b) Na33Co(NO2)64, (c) 3Ru(en)34Br3,  
(d) 3Mo(EDTA)]ClO4, (e) K33ReCl64.
