n’t know how not to talk to our cousins. 
 
 People in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not 
 
 132 
 
 talking to each other and it takes years of practice.There are people who 
 
 don’t talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in 
 
 the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his 
 
 family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are 
 
 families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the 
 
 least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will 
 
 be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move 
 
 to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed 
 
 of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the 
 
 sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families 
 
 are known ever after as soupers. It’s a terrible thing to be a souper 
 
  
  
 because you’re doomed forever to the souper part
