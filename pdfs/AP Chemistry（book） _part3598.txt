two of these domains, the molecular geometry is bent:

Because there are six electron domains around the central Br 
atom in this ion, the electron-domain geometry is octahedral. 
The two nonbonding pairs of electrons are located opposite 
each other on the octahedron, leading to a square-planar  
molecular geometry:

(b) The observation that conductivity decreases as temperature 
increases indicates that there are fewer ions present in the solu-
tion at the higher temperature. Thus, increasing the tempera-
ture causes the equilibrium to shift to the left. According to Le 
Châtelier’s principle, this shift indicates that the reaction is 
exothermic as it proceeds from left to right.
