olution (the process of dilution) decreases the concentration of the 
solute without changing the number of moles of solute in the solu-
tion 1Mconc * Vconc = Mdil * Vdil2.
SOLUTION STOICHIOMETRY AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 
 
(SECTION 4.6) In the process called titration, we combine a solution of 
known concentration (a standard solution) with a solution of unknown 
concentration to determine the unknown concentration or the quantity 
of solute in the unknown. The point in the titration at which stoichio-
metrically equivalent quantities of reactants are brought together is called 
the equivalence point. An indicator can be used to show the end point of 
the titration, which coincides closely with the equivalence point.
