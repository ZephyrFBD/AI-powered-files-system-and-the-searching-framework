 proven that ribozyme, a type of RNA, can catalyze
reactions like enzymes do, as well as transmit information to the next
generation like DNA does. In 1989, the Nobel Prize was awarded to
Professors Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman for their discovery of
ribozyme, which has several surprising functions:
Functions as an enzyme to catalyze reactions
Splices RNA by itself, without the need for proteins
Removes its own introns during RNA processing
Joins amino acids together to form a polypeptide during translation
in ribosomes
In the past 50 years since the development of the RNA World
hypothesis and the discovery of ribozymes, the concept of RNA World has
gone from speculation to a prevailing idea.

Note that the existence of ribozymes is an exception to the idea that all
biological catalysts are proteins. RNA is not a protein.
