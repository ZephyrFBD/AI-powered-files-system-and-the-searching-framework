no tuner hears one beat every 2.0 s when trying to
adjust two strings, one of which is sounding 350 Hz. How
far off in frequency is the other string?
47. (I) A certain dog whistle operates at 23.5 kHz, while another
(brand X) operates at an unknown frequency. If humans
can hear neither whistle when played separately, but a shrill
whine of frequency 5000 Hz occurs when they are played
simultaneously, estimate the operating frequency of brand X.
48. (II) What is the beat frequency if middle C (262 Hz) and 
(277 Hz) are played together? What if each is played
two octaves lower (each frequency reduced by a factor of 4)?
49. (II) A guitar string produces 
when sounded with
a 350-Hz tuning fork and 
when sounded with a
355-Hz tuning fork. What is the vibrational frequency of the
string? Explain your reasoning.
50. (II) Two violin strings are tuned to the same frequency,
294 Hz. The tension in one string is then decreased by 2.5%.
What will be the beat frequency heard when the two strings
are
