ck into nitrogen gas, which returns to the air. Together, all of these
steps make up the nitrogen cycle.
Photosynthesis and respiration are the complementary reactions of the
carbon cycle. In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water combine to
form sugars and oxygen; the Sunâ€™s energy is stored in the bonds among
carbon atoms in the sugars. Respiration uses carbohydrates and oxygen
to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy; it releases the energy that
is stored by photosynthesis. As animals eat the plants and one another

and then breathe, carbon moves through the food web; the carbon that
plants and animals contain is returned to the soil when they decompose.
The carbon in the soil enters the cycle again, perhaps as part of a
microorganism. A great deal of carbon is stored in the oceans and in
minerals. Combustion is another way that carbon enters the atmosphere,
in the form of carbon dioxide. The widespread and heavy use of fossil
fuels has created concerns about how
