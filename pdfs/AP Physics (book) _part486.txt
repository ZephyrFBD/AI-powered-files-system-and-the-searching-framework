on the string with
your hand displaced from the center of the circle. In athletics, a hammer thrower
accelerates the hammer tangentially in a similar way so that it reaches a high speed
before release.
The tangential component of the acceleration,
has magnitude equal to
the rate of change of the magnitude of the object’s velocity:
The radial (centripetal) acceleration arises from the change in direction of the
velocity and, as we have seen (Eq. 5–1), has magnitude
The tangential acceleration always points in a direction tangent to the circle, and
is in the direction of motion (parallel to 
which is always tangent to the circle) 
if the speed is increasing, as shown in Fig. 5–15b. If the speed is decreasing,
points antiparallel to 
In either case,
and 
are always perpendicular 
to each other; and their directions change continually as the object moves along
its circular path. The total vector acceleration is the sum of the two components:
Since 
and 
are always perpendicular to each oth
