down a long steep hill without shifting into a lower
gear. (a) Explain why this happens in terms of energy and
power. (b) Would it matter if the same elevation change was
made going down a steep hill or a gradual hill? Explain
your reasoning. [Hint: Read Sections 6–4, 6–9, and 6–10
carefully.] (c) Why does shifting into a lower gear help?
[Hint: Use your own experience, downshifting in a car.]
(d) Calculate the thermal energy dissipated from the brakes
in an 8000-kg truck that descends a 12° hill. The truck
begins braking when its speed is 
and slows to a
speed of 
in a distance of 0.36 km measured along
the road.
3. (a) Only two conservative forces are discussed in this Chap-
ter. What are they,and how are they accounted for when you
are dealing with conservation of energy? (b) Not mentioned
is the force of water on a swimmer. Is it conservative or
nonconservative?
4. Give at least two examples of friction doing positive work.
