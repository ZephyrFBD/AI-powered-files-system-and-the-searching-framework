mic acid (e) all three 
solutions have the same electrical conductivity
 
â–¶Practice Exercise 2
Imagine a diagram showing 10 Na+ ions and 10 OH- ions. If 
this solution were mixed with the one pictured above for HY, 
what species would be present in a diagram that represents the 
combined solutions after any possible reaction?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to rank three acids from strongest to weakest, 
based on schematic drawings of their solutions.
Plan We can determine the relative numbers of uncharged molecular 
species in the diagrams. The strongest acid is the one with the most 
H+ ions and fewest undissociated molecules in solution. The weakest 
acid is the one with the largest number of undissociated molecules.
Solve The order is HY 7 HZ 7 HX. HY is a strong acid because 
it is totally ionized (no HY molecules in solution), whereas both 
HX and HZ are weak acids, whose solutions consist of a mixture of 
molecules and ions. Because HZ contains more H+ ions and fewer 
molecules th
