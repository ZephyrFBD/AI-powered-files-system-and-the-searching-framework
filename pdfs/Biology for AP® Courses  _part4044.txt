released through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open. Reproductive organs evolved with the development of
gonads that produce sperm and eggs. These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number
of chromosomes in each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.
Complete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. Sperm are made in testes and then travel
through coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. Eggs mature in the ovary. When they are released from the ovary, they
travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization. Some insects have a specialized sac, called a spermatheca, which stores sperm
for later use, sometimes up to a year. Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for
offspring survival.
Vertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences. Non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body
