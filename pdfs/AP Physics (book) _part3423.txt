(a) How long would you expect to wait for one proton in
your body to decay (approximate your body as all water)?
(b) Of the roughly 7 billion people on Earth, about how
many would have a proton in their body decay in a 70 yr
lifetime?
65. The original experiments which established that an atom
has a heavy, positive nucleus were done by shooting alpha
particles through gold foil. The alpha particles had a
kinetic energy of 7.7 MeV. What is the closest they could
get to the center of a gold nucleus? How does this compare
with the size of the nucleus?
66. How long must you wait (in half-lives) for a radioactive
sample to drop to 2.00% of its original activity?
67. If the potassium isotope 
gives 
in a liter of
milk, estimate how much 
and regular 
are in a liter
of milk. Use Appendix B.
68. Strontium-90 is produced as a nuclear fission product of
uranium in both reactors and atomic bombs. Look at its
location in the Periodic Table to see what other elements it
