a factor of 10 corresponds to a sound level increase of 10 dB. An
increase in intensity by a factor of 100 corresponds to a sound level increase of
20 dB. Thus a 50-dB sound is 100 times more intense than a 30-dB sound, and so on.
Intensities and sound levels for some common sounds are listed in Table 12–2.
