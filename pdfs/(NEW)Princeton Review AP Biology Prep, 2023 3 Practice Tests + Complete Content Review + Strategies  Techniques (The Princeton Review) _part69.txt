ened and no transcription factors will bind at any location.
36. D
At each level of the food chain, approximately 10% of energy is used to build biomass for the next level. The
primary consumers would have approximately 298.7 g/m2 of biomass, and the secondary consumers would
have approximately 29.87 g/m2 of biomass.
37. A
The question states that the change affects the place where the substrate binds, which is defined as the active
site. Position A is identified as the active site.
38. D
Position B has nonpolar residues and is not the active site, since Position A is the active site. Therefore, (A) is
not correct since the substrate does not bind at Position B. It doesnâ€™t look like it is where the homodimer is, so
(C) is incorrect. There is no information to indicate that (B) is correct. Nonpolar residues are known to be
helpful for inserting into the lipid bilayer, which makes (D) a strong answer.
39. D
A homodimer is formed when more than one polypeptide subunit come together. This
