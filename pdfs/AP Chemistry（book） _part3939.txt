o the same hydrogen 
bonding, electrostatic, and dispersion forces we have seen before. 
Hemoglobin, the protein used to transport oxygen molecules in 
our blood, is an example of a protein that has quaternary structure. 
Hemoglobin is a tetramer; it is made of four smaller polypeptides, 
two “alphas” and two “betas.” (These names do not imply anything 
about the number of alpha helices or beta sheets in the individ-
ual polypeptides.) Design a set of experiments that would provide 
sound evidence that hemoglobin exists as a tetramer and not as one 
enormous polypeptide chain.

A.1 | Exponential Notation
The numbers used in chemistry are often either extremely large or extremely small. Such 
numbers are conveniently expressed in the form
N * 10n
where N is a number between 1 and 10, and n is the exponent. Some examples of this 
exponential notation, which is also called scientific notation, follow.
1,200,000 is 1.2 *
