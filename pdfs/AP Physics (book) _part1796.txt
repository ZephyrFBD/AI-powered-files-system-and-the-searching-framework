E near any conducting surface. Show that the magnitude
of the electric field just outside the surface of a good conductor of any shape is
given by
where 
is defined as the surface charge density,
on the conductor’s surface
at that point.
APPROACH We choose as our gaussian surface a small cylindrical box, very
small in height so that one of its circular ends is just above the conductor 
(Fig. 16–46). The other end is just below the conductor’s surface, and the very
short sides are perpendicular to it.
SOLUTION The electric field is zero inside a conductor and is perpendicular to
the surface just outside it (Section 16–9), so electric flux passes only through
the outside end of our cylindrical box; no flux passes through the very short sides
or through the inside end of our gaussian box. We choose the area A (of the flat
cylinder end above the conductor surface) small enough so that E is essentially
unifo
