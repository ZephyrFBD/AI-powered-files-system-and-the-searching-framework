f oxygen in our 
environment.
Most metal oxides are basic. Those that dissolve in water react to form metal hydrox-
ides, as in the following examples:
Metal oxide + water ¡ metal hydroxide
 
Na2O1s2 + H2O1l2 ¡ 2 NaOH1aq2 
[7.8]
 
CaO1s2 + H2O1l2 ¡ Ca1OH221aq2 
[7.9]
The basicity of metal oxides is due to the oxide ion, which reacts with water:
 
O2 -1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡ 2 OH-1aq2 
[7.10]

CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
(a) Would you expect scandium oxide to be a solid, liquid, or gas at room temperature?
(b) Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction of scandium oxide with nitric acid.
Sample Exercise 7.8 
Properties of Metal Oxides
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We are asked about one physical property of 
scandium oxide—its state at room temperature—and one chemi-
cal property—how it reacts with nitric acid.
Solve
(a) Because scandium oxide is the oxide of a metal, we expect it 
to be an ionic solid. Indeed
