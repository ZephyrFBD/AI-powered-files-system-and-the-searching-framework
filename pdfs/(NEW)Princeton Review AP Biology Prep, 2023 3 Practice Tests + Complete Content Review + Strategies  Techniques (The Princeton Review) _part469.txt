rker and grew in white colonies. The colonies were counted after 24 hours of growth.
In another example, suppose fly populations were monitored in northern Maine to determine if population size
varies over the warm months of the year.
Count data can be analyzed with hypothesis testing, which will be described later in this chapter.
Measurements
Measurements are continuous, meaning there is an infinite number of potential measurements over a given range.
Size, height, temperature, weight, and response rate are all measurements. There are two types of measurement data:
parametric and nonparametric.
Normal or Parametric Data
Normal, or parametric, data is measurement data that fits a normal curve, or normal distribution, usually when
a large sample size is used. For example, if you took a large sample of 17-year-olds in America and graphed the
frequency of heights, the results will be normally distributed.
Several descriptive statistics can be used to summarize normal data.
The sample siz
