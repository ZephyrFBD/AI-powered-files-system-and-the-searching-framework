Isotopes
Isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
Some elements—such as carbon, potassium, and uranium—have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12 contains six
protons, six neutrons, and six electrons; therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons). Carbon-14
contains six protons, eight neutrons, and six electrons; its atomic mass is 14 (six protons and eight neutrons). These two
alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes may emit neutrons, protons, and electrons, and attain a more stable
atomic configuration (lower level of potential energy); these are radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes. Radioactive decay
