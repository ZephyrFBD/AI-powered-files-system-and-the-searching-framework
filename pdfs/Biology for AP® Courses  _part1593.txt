d.
Watson and Crick used X-ray diffraction
methods to demonstrate the helical nature of
DNA, while Rosalind Franklin formulated the
double stranded structural model of DNA.
58. What do RNA and DNA have in common?
a.
Both contain four different nucleotides.
b.
Both are usually double-stranded molecules.
c.
Both contain adenine and uracil.
d.
Both contain ribose.
59. Which of the following would be a good application of
plasmid transformation?
a.
to make copies of DNA
b.
to isolate a change in a single nucleotide
c.
to separate DNA fragments
d.
to sequence DNA
60. Explain how the components of DNA fit together.
a.
DNA is composed of nucleotides, consisting of a
5 carbon sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous
base. DNA is a double helical structure in which
complementary base pairing occurs. Adenine
pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with
cytosine.
