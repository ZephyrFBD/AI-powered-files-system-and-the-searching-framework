When the neutralization steps of a polyprotic acid or polybasic base are sufficiently 
separated, the titration has multiple equivalence points. Figure 17.15 shows the two 
equivalence points corresponding to Equations 17.13 and 17.14.
You can use titration data such as that shown in Figure 17.15 to figure out the pKas of 
the weak polyprotic acid. For example, let’s write the Ka1 and Ka2 reactions for phospho-
rous acid:
H3PO31aq2 ∆H2PO3
-1aq2 + H +1aq2  Ka1 =
3H2PO3
-43H +4
3H3PO34
H2PO3
-1aq2 ∆HPO3
2 -1aq2 + H +1aq2  Ka2 =
3HPO3
2 -43H +4
3H2PO3
-4
If we rearrange these equilibrium expressions, you see that we obtain Henderson– 
Hasselbalch equations:
 pH = pKa1 + log 
3H2PO3
-4
3H3PO34
 pH = pKa2 + log 
3HPO3
2 -4
3H2PO3
-4
Therefore, if the concentrations of each acid and base conjugate pair are identical for each 
equilibrium, log 112 = 0 and
