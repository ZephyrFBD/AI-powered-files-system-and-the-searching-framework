CHAPTER 7
Linear Momentum
Suppose the three particles lie on the x axis and have masses 
and positions 
From Eq. 7–9a for the center of mass, we can write
where
is the total mass of the system. If these particles
are in motion (say, along the x axis with velocities 
and 
respectively),
then in a short time interval 
each particle and the CM will have traveled a dis-
tance  
so that
We cancel 
and get
(7;10)
Since
is the sum of the momenta of the particles 
of the system, it represents the total momentum of the system. Thus we see from
Eq. 7–10 that the total (linear) momentum of a system of particles is equal to the
product of the total mass M and the velocity of the center of mass of the system.
Or, the linear momentum of an extended object is the product of the object’s mass
and the velocity of its CM.
If forces are acting on the particles, then the particles may be accelerating. In 
a short time interval 
each particle’s velocity will change
