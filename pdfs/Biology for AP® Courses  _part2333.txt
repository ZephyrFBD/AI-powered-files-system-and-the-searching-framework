l adhesion molecule, which functions to keep different types of immune cells in close proximity to
each other during the generation of a T lymphocyte immune response.
Figure 21.3 The KSHV virus binds the xCT receptor on the surface of human cells. xCT receptors protect cells against
stress. Stressed cells express more xCT receptors than non-stressed cells. The KSHV virion causes cells to become
stressed, thereby increasing expression of the receptor to which it binds. (credit: modification of work by NIAID, NIH)
Among the most complex virions known, the T4 bacteriophage, which infects the Escherichia coli bacterium, has a tail
structure that the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its DNA.
Adenovirus, a non-enveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses glycoprotein spikes protruding
from its capsomeres to attach to host cells. Non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar
