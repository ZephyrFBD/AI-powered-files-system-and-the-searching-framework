rs of sediment show gradual changes in the size of the oyster
shell alternating with rapid changes in shell size. Large, rapid changes produced new species.
The age of many fossils can be determined using C-14 dating. In this procedure, the natural decay rate of a
radioactive isotope of carbon (C-14) is used to determine the age of the fossil.
2. Biogeography uses geography to describe the distribution of species. This information has revealed that unrelated
species in different regions of the world look alike when found in similar environments. This provides strong
evidence for the role of natural selection in evolution.
Rabbits did not exist in Australia until introduced by humans. A native Australian hare wallaby resembles a rabbit
both in structure and habit. As similar as these two animals appear, they are not that closely related. The rabbit is a
placental mammal, while the wallaby is a marsupial mammal. The fetus of a placental mammal develops in the
female uterus, obtaining nou
