anscription of DNA. Describe how
environmental stimuli, such as ultraviolet light exposure,
could modify gene expression.
a.
UV rays could cause methylation and
deacetylation of the genes that could alter the
accessibility and transcription of DNA.
b.
The UV rays could cause phosphorylation and
acetylation of the DNA and histones which
could alter the transcriptional capabilities of the
DNA.
c.
UV rays could cause methylation and
phosphorylation of the DNA bases which could
become dimerized rendering no accessibility of
DNA.
d.
The UV rays can cause methylation and
acetylation of histones making the DNA more
tightly packed and leading to inaccessibility.
38. New drugs are being developed that decrease DNA
methylation and prevent the removal of acetyl groups from
histone proteins. Explain how these drugs could affect
gene expression to help kill tumor cells.
a.
These drugs maintain the demethylated and the
acetylated forms of the DNA to keep
transcription of necessary genes “on”.
b.
The
