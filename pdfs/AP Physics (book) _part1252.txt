ing to produce (a) one loop, (b) two loops,
and (c) five loops of a standing wave? Assume the string 
at the oscillator is a node, which is nearly true.
l = 1.50 m
3.5 * 10–4 kgm.
l = 62 cm,

just the right frequency, the water alternately rises and
falls at each end, remaining relatively calm at the center.
Suppose the frequency to produce such a standing wave 
in a 75-cm-wide tub is 0.85 Hz. What is the speed of the
water wave?
*11–13 Refraction
*58. (I) An earthquake P wave traveling at 
strikes a
boundary within the Earth between two kinds of material.
If it approaches the boundary at an incident angle of 44°
and the angle of refraction is 33°, what is the speed in the
second medium?
*59. (II) A sound wave is traveling in warm air when it hits a
layer of cold, dense air. If the sound wave hits the cold air
interface at an angle of 25°, what is the angle of refrac-
tion? Assume that the cold air temperature is 
and
the war
