 corresponds to only a very small change in
the subjective sensation of apparent loudness. Indeed, the average human can
distinguish a difference in sound level of only about 1 or 2 dB.
Normally, the loudness or intensity of a sound decreases as you get farther
from the source of the sound. Indoors, this effect is altered because of reflections
from the walls. However, if a source is in the open so that sound can radiate out
freely in all directions, the intensity decreases as the inverse square of the distance,
as we saw in Section 11–9. Over large distances, the intensity decreases faster
than 
because some of the energy is transferred into irregular motion of air
molecules. This loss happens more for higher frequencies, so any sound of mixed
frequencies will be less “bright” at a distance. Far from an outdoor band, you hear
mainly the boom of the drums.
