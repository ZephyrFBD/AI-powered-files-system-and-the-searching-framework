data.
(c) Construct an additional line on your graph from part (a) that represents your prediction as to the expected
experimental results at a temperature of 10Â° Celsius in the absence of compound X.
(d) Explain your prediction from part (c), stating why you placed the additional line where you did.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (B) Using a paper disk soaked in water would demonstrate the rate of reaction without the enzyme and would
provide a basis for comparison. Choice (A) is incorrect because changing the temperature in just one of the
beakers would introduce another variable into the experiment. Choice (C) is incorrect because this change
would only lead to comparing the effectiveness of liver catalase versus that of potato catalase. Changing the pH
in just one of the beakers would also introduce another variable into the experiment, so choice (D) is also
incorrect.
2. (A) Boiling denatures most enzymes, making them ineffective, and thus the reaction time would increase.
