 becomes zero for any finite r), which makes sense because
the mass of its virtual exchange particle, the photon, is zero (in the denominator
of the above equation).
[We did a similar calculation for the strong force in Section 32–2, estimating
the mass of the 
meson as exchange particle. In our deeper view of the strong
force, namely the color force between quarks within a nucleon, the gluons have
zero mass, which implies infinite range (see formula in Example 32–10). We
might have expected a range of about 
(nuclear size). But according to the
Standard Model, the color force is weak at very close distances and increases
greatly with distance (causing quark confinement). Thus its range could be infinite.]
