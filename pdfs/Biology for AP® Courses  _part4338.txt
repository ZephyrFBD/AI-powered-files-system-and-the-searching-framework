life expectancy. Life tables may include the probability of individuals
dying before their next birthday (i.e., their mortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age
interval, and their life expectancy at each interval. An example of a life table is shown in Table 36.1 from a study of Dall
mountain sheep, a species native to northwestern North America. Notice that the population is divided into age intervals
(column A). The mortality rate (per 1000), shown in column D, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age

interval (column B) divided by the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (Column C), multiplied
by 1000.
mortality rate = number of individuals dying
number of individuals surviving x 1000
For example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were
