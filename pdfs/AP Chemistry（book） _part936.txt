al. The value of l for a particular orbital is generally des-
ignated by the letters s, p, d, and f,** corresponding to l values of 0, 1, 2, and 3:

3. The magnetic quantum number, ml, can have integral values between -l and 
l, including zero. This quantum number describes the orientation of the orbital in 
space, as we discuss in Section 6.6.
Notice that because the value of n can be any positive integer, there is an infinite 
number of orbitals for the hydrogen atom. At any given instant, however, the elec-
tron in a hydrogen atom is described by only one of these orbitalsâ€”we say that the 
electron occupies a certain orbital. The remaining orbitals are unoccupied for that par-
ticular state of the hydrogen atom. We will focus mainly on orbitals that have small 
values of n.
