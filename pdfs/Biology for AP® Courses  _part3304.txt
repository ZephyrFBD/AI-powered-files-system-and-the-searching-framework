nd testosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone.
These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs, respectively. Other steroid hormones include
aldosterone and cortisol, which are released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens. Steroid
hormones are insoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood. As a result, they remain in
circulation longer than peptide hormones. For example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while epinephrine, an
amino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute.

estradiol.
Amino Acid-Derived Hormones
The amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and
tryptophan, shown in Figure 28.3. If a hormone is amino acid-derived, its chemical name will end in “-ine”. Examples of
