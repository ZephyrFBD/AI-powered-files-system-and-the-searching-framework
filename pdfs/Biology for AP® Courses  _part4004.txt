a.
It helps in communication of antibodies with
other components of immune system.
b.
It helps the antibodies to function with very low
affinity and specificity.
c.
It enables many different antibodies to be made
that all have different specificities of binding.
d.
It enables many different antibodies to be made
that all have same specificities of binding.
39. How can you explain that the same antibodies found in
an infant’s body are also present in the infant’s mother?
a.
Antibodies produced in the mother’s body are
passed to the infant via passive immunity
through breast milk.
