m in 4" pots.
I would weigh each at the beginning of the experiment, and
then I would weigh each again at the end of the experiment.
Since the mass of the plants will not be exactly the same as at
the outset, I will calculate and use percent change in mass for
my results. (In all three setups, I will place a heat sink [a large
beaker of water] between the light and the plant to absorb the
heat that is produced by the light source. This will eliminate
heat as an unwanted variable in the experiment.)
My control will be Plant I, which is placed under a 100-watt
light.
My treatment 1 will be Plant II, which has a clear baggie placed
over it and is placed under a 100-watt light.
My treatment 2 will be Plant III, which will have a fan pointed
directly at its leaves while it is exposed to a 100-watt light. This
setup will be placed away from the other two plants so that the
fan will not affect them.
I would begin the experiment at time zero and leave all three
plants under the same conditions
