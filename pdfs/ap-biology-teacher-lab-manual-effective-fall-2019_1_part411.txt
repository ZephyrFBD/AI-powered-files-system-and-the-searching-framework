olding the capillary tube straight up, add a small amount of hot glue 
around its base (where it meets the syringe) to seal the capillary to the syringe. Keep the 
capillary pointed straight up until the glue cools — this should not take long. If needed, 
add a bit more glue to ensure an airtight seal between the capillary and syringe. (See 
Figure 3.)

Step 5 After the glue has cooled, pull back on the plunger and make sure that the glue 
has not plugged the capillary. If the capillary is plugged, carefully remove the glue and 
capillary and start over. 
Preparing the Microrespirometer 
Step 1 Draw a small quantity of manometer fluid (soapy water with red food coloring) 
into the full length of the microrespirometer’s capillary tube. Then eject the fluid back 
out of the capillary. This coats the inside of the tube with a thin soapy film that helps 
prevent the manometer fluid from sti
