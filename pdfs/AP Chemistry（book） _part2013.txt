(a) The density of diamond is 3.5 g>cm3, and that of 
graphite is 2.3 g>cm3. Based on the structure of buckmin-
sterfullerene, what would you expect its density to be 
relative to these other forms of carbon? (b) X-ray diffrac-
tion studies of buckminsterfullerene show that it has a 
face-centered cubic lattice of C60 molecules. The length of 
an edge of the unit cell is 14.2 Ã…. Calculate the density of 
buckminsterfullerene.

When you shine light of band gap energy or higher on a 
semiconductor and promote electrons from the valence 
band to the conduction band, do you expect the conduc-
tivity of the semiconductor to (a) remain unchanged, 
 
(b) increase, or (c) decrease?
