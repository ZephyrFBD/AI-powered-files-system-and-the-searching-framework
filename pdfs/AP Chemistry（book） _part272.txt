bosons.*  As chemists, however, we can take a simple view of the atom because only three 
 
subatomic  
particles—the proton, neutron, and electron—have a bearing on chemical 
behavior.
As noted earlier, the charge of an electron is -1.602 * 10-19 C. The charge of a pro-
ton is opposite in sign but equal in magnitude to that of an electron: +1.602 * 10-19 C. 
The quantity 1.602 * 10-19 C is called the electronic charge. For convenience, the 
charges of atomic and subatomic particles are usually expressed as multiples of this 
charge rather than as coulombs. Thus, the charge of an electron is 1- and that of 
a proton is 1+. Neutrons are electrically neutral (which is how they received their 
name). Every atom has an equal number of electrons and protons, so atoms have no net
