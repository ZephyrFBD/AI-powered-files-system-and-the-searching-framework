ic field 
In the case illustrated, the potential
energy decreases (
is negative); and as the charged particle accelerates from
point a to point b in Fig. 17–1, the particle’s kinetic energy KE increases—by an
equal amount. In accord with the conservation of energy, electric potential energy
is transformed into kinetic energy, and the total energy is conserved. Note that
the positive charge q has its greatest potential energy at point a, near the positive
plate.† The reverse is true for a negative charge: its potential energy is greatest
near the negative plate.
Electric Potential and Potential Difference
In Chapter 16, we found it useful to define the electric field as the force per unit
charge. Similarly, it is useful to define the electric potential (or simply the
potential when “electric” is understood) as the electric potential energy per unit
charge. Electric potential is given the symbol V. If a positive test charge q in an
electric field has electric potential energy
