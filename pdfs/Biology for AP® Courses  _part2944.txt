mals need free energy, primarily supplied by carbohydrates, to maintain
homeostasis. ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is produced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and
mitochondria, where carbohydrates, proteins, and fats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular
respiration. When the amount of ATP available exceeds the body’s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and glucose
to produce molecules of glycogen. The ability to store excess energy is an evolutionary adaptation that helps animals deal
with mobility and food shortages.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with
