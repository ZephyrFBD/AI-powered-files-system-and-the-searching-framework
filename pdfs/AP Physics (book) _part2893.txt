plane as they do on Earth. (This assumes no vibrations or rocking
which would make the reference frame noninertial.) When you walk, drink a
cup of soup, play pool, or drop a pencil on the floor while traveling in a train,
airplane, or ship moving at constant velocity, the objects move just as they do
when you are at rest on Earth. Suppose you are in a car traveling rapidly at
constant velocity. If you drop a coin from above your head inside the car, how
will it fall? It falls straight downward with respect to the car, and hits the floor
directly below the point of release, Fig. 26–2a. This is just how objects fall on the
Earth—straight down—and thus our experiment in the moving car is in accord
with the relativity principle. (If you drop the coin out the car’s window, this won’t
happen because the moving air drags the coin backward relative to the car.)
Note in this example, however, that to an observer on the Earth, the coin fol-
lows a curved path, Fig. 26–2b. The actual path followe
