e secretion. Antidiuretic
hormone helps with water loss.
d.
Stress decreases osmolality, which decreases
antidiuretic hormone secretion. Antidiuretic
hormone helps with water loss.
46. Identify which type of feedback mechanism primarily
controls hormone production and release and explain why
this occurs.
a.
Positive feedback loop to help maintain the
water concentration in the body.
b.
Negative feedback loop to help maintain the
water concentration in the body.
c.
Negative feedback loop to help maintain proper
bodily functions within a specific range.
d.
Positive feedback loop to help maintain proper
bodily functions within a specific range.
47. Compare and contrast humoral and hormonal stimuli.
a.
Both humoral and hormonal stimuli release
proteins. Humoral stimuli are hormones that
stimulate other hormones, whereas hormonal
stimuli are extracellular fluid-related stimuli.
b.
Both humoral and hormonal stimuli release
proteins. Humoral stimuli are extracellular fluid-
related stimuli, w
