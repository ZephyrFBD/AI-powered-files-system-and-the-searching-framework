cation between the regulatory proteins involved in gene expression; they do not
bind to regulatory switches, so choice (D) is incorrect.
8. (B) The genetic code contains more than one codon for most amino acids, so a change in a codon does not
necessarily result in a change in the amino acid for which it codes. While changes in the environment can affect
the expression of genes, the statement in choice (A) does not explain why changes in the DNA sequence may
not result in changes in the amino acid found in the final protein. Thus, choice (A) is incorrect. Ribosomes do
not have a proofreading function, so choice (C) is incorrect. Differential gene expression results in cell
differentiation but not changes in the DNA sequence, so choice (D) is incorrect.
9. (D) The phenotype of an organism is determined by the genes that are expressed, the level of expression of
those genes, and the timing of the expression of those genes. The phenotype is not affected by the number of
genes in the organ
