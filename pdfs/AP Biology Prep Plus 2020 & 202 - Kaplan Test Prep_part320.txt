e blood and promotes the uptake of glucose by cells.
In type I diabetes, the body is unable to produce insulin. In type II
diabetes, cells are insulin-resistant and do not respond to insulin
stimulus. The graph shows levels of glucose and insulin in the
blood of three patients aȇer eating.
Based on the curves, which patient is the most likely to be
diagnosed with type II diabetes?

Patient A, because his insulin and glucose levels remain high
aȇer 2 hours
(A)
Patient B, because her insulin levels show a strong peak aȇer
ingestion of glucose
(B)
Patient C, because his insulin levels never increase
(C)
All three patients, because the glucose levels in their blood
increase sharply during the glucose tolerance test
