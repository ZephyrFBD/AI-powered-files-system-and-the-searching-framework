lecules then became the building blocks or monomers of more complex molecules.
5. Monomers began joining to form polymers that, over time, began to replicate, store, and transfer
information. For example, amino acids are natural monomers that combine to form proteins, and
nucleotides bond together to form nucleic acids.
6. Complex reactions could have occurred in a solution, known as the Organic Soup Model, or as
reactions on solid reactive surfaces.
7. RNA (ribonucleic acid)—the first genetic material; it is capable of self-replication and can act as both
genotype and phenotype. Eventually, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) became the genetic material
because of its stability over RNA and its ability to correct mutations.
B. Earth’s History
1. Geographical Evidence:
i.
Earth is most likely around 5 billion years old.
ii. Earth’s environment was too hostile for life until about 3.9 billion years ago.
iii. Earliest fossil records date back 3.5 billion years ago.
