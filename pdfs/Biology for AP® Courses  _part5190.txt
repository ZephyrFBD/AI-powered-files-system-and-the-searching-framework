sis describing how
the ‘virus’ was imagined into fake existence when he dissected an
article published by Nature and wriĴen by 19 authors detailing
alleged ‘sequencing of a complete viral genome’ of the ‘new SARS-
CoV-2 virus’. This computer-modelled in silico genome was used as a
template for all subsequent genome sequencing experiments that
resulted in the so-called variants which he said now number more
than 6,000. The fake genome was constructed from more than 56
million individual short strands of RNA. Those liĴle pieces were
assembled into longer pieces by ﬁnding areas of overlapping
sequences. The computer programs created over two million
possible combinations from which the authors simply chose the
longest one. They then compared this to a ‘bat virus’ and the
computer ‘alignment’ rearranged the sequence and ﬁlled in the gaps!
They called this computer-generated abomination the ‘complete
genome’. Dr Tom Cowan, a fellow medical author and collaborator
with Kaufman, said such com
