the system reacts to produce more of substance.
Pressure: changing the pressure by changing the volume
At constant temperature, reducing the volume of a gaseous equilibrium
mixture causes the system to shift in the direction that reduces the
number of moles of gas.
Temperature:

If the temperature of a system at equilibrium is increased, the system reacts as if we added a reactant to an endothermic reaction
or a product to an exothermic reaction.  The equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes the “excess reagent,” namely, heat.
