13–10 Distribution of Molecular Speeds
The molecules in a gas are assumed to be in random motion, which means that
many molecules have speeds less than the rms speed and others have greater
speeds. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) derived, on the basis of kinetic
theory, that the speeds of molecules in a gas are distributed according to the
graph shown in Fig. 13–19. This is known as the Maxwell distribution of speeds.†
The speeds vary from zero to many times the rms speed, but as the graph shows,
most molecules have speeds that are not far from the average. Less than 1% of
the molecules exceed four times 
Experiments to determine the distribution of molecular speeds in real gases,
starting in the 1920s, confirmed with considerable accuracy the Maxwell distri-
bution and the direct proportion between average kinetic energy and absolute
temperature, Eq. 13–8.
