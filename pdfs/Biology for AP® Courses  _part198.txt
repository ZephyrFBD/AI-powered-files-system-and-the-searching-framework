negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule.

Water’s Cohesive and Adhesive Properties
Have you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows, the
water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of
cohesion. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules
together at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass.
Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when
placed under tension or stress. This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flatten
