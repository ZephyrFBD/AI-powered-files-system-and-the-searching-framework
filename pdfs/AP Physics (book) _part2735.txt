two narrow slits.
How far apart are the slits?
3. (II) Monochromatic light falls on two very narrow slits
0.048 mm apart. Successive fringes on a screen 6.50 m away
are 8.5 cm apart near the center of the pattern. Determine
the wavelength and frequency of the light.
4. (II) If 720-nm and 660-nm light passes through two slits
0.62 mm apart, how far apart are the second-order fringes
for these two wavelengths on a screen 1.0 m away?
5. (II) Water waves having parallel crests 4.5 cm apart pass
through two openings 7.5 cm apart in a board. At a point
3.0 m beyond the board, at what angle relative to the
“straight-through” direction would there be little or no
wave action?
6. (II) A red laser from the physics lab is marked as producing
632.8-nm light. When light from this laser falls on two
closely spaced slits, an interference pattern formed on a
wall several meters away has bright red fringes spaced 5.00 mm
apart near the center of the pattern. When the laser is
replaced by a small laser
