Alternation of Generations
The third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is a blend of the haploid-dominant and diploid-dominant
extremes. Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their
life cycle. The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells.
Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes
is already a haploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of
mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo
meiosis and
