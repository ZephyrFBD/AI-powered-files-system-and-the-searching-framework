e low pressure had reduced the boiling 
point of water, causing the water to boil. Another friend 
tells you that the first bubbles were gas molecules from the 
air (oxygen, nitrogen, and so forth) that were dissolved 
in the water. Which friend is mostly likely to be correct? 
What, then, is responsible for the second batch of bubbles?

 13.10  This portion of a phase diagram shows the vapor–pressure 
curves of a volatile solvent and of a solution of that solvent 
containing a nonvolatile solute. (a) Which line represents 
the solution? (b) What are the normal boiling points of the 
solvent and the solution? [Section 13.5]

 13.11  Suppose you had a balloon made of some highly flexible 
semipermeable membrane. The balloon is filled completely 
with a 0.2 M solution of some solute and is submerged in a 
0.1 M solution of the same solute:
0.1 M
0.2 M
 
 Initially, the volume of solution in the balloon is 0.25 L. As-
