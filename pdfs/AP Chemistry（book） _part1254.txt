lements. With some exceptions (espe-
cially in the transition metals), electronegativity decreases with increasing atomic number in a 
group. This is what we expect because we know that ionization energies decrease with increas-
ing atomic number in a group and electron affinities do not change very much.
You do not need to memorize electronegativity values. Instead, you should know the 
periodic trends so that you can predict which of two elements is more electronegative.
Give It Some Thought
How does the electronegativity of an element differ from its electron affinity?

CHAPTER 8 Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding
Electronegativity and Bond Polarity
We can use the difference in electronegativity between two atoms to gauge the polarity 
of the bond the atoms form. Consider these three fluorine-containing compounds:
F2
HF
LiF
Electronegativity difference
4.0 - 4.0 = 0
4.0 - 2.1 = 1.9
4.0 - 1.0 = 3.0
Type of bond
Nonpolar covalent
Polar covalent
Ionic
In F2 the electrons are shared
