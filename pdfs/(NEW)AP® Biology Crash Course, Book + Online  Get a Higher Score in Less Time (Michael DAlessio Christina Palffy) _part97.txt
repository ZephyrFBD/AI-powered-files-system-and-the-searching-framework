RNA Structure and Gene Expression
I.
Key Concepts
A. RNA transcription produces rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA, all of which have different roles during the
process of translation.
B. In its sequence of nucleotides, mRNA carries the genetic information present in an organism’s DNA (also
in the form of sequences of nucleotides) from the nucleus to the ribosome.
C. Translation (protein synthesis) converts the information in the nucleotide sequences of mRNA int
