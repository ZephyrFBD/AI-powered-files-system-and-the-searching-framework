 is 31+12 + 1-22 = +1, which equals the net charge 
of the ion. This rule is useful in obtaining the oxidation number of one atom in a 
compound or ion if you know the oxidation numbers of the other atoms, as illus-
trated in Sample Exercise 4.8.
 
Sample Exercise 4.8 
Determining Oxidation Numbers

2-.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1

(a) O2 (b) H2O (c) H2SO4 (d) H2O2 (e) KCH3COO
 
▶Practice Exercise 2

(a) P
2O5, (b) NaH, (c) Cr2O7
2-, (d) SnBr4, (e) BaO2?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to determine the oxidation number of sulfur 
in two molecular species, in the elemental form, and in two  
substances containing ions.
Plan In each species, the sum of oxidation numbers of all the  
atoms must equal the charge on the species. We will use the rules 
outlined previously to assign oxidation numbers
