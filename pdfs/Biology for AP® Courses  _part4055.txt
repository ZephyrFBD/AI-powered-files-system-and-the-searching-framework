of the force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a
nutrient), enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate
several minutes after release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.
The bulbourethral gland, or Cowperâ€™s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It
neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in
the total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent
pregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions. The location and functions of the male
reproductive organs are summarized in Table 34.1.
