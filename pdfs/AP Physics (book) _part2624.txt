5. Justify the second part of sign convention 3, page 665,
starting “Equivalently.” Use ray diagrams for all possible
situations. Cite Figures already in the text and draw any
others needed.

(b) the object inside the focal length of a diverging lens;
(c) the object outside the focal length of a converging lens;
(d) the object outside the focal length of a diverging lens;
