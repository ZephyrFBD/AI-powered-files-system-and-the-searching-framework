arctica, a phenomenon known as the ozone hole (Figure 18.7). The first 
scientific paper on this phenomenon appeared in 1985, and the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) maintains an “Ozone Hole Watch” website with daily 
updates and data from 1999 to the present.
In 1995, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to F. Sherwood Rowland, 
Mario Molina, and Paul Crutzen for their studies of ozone depletion. In 1970, Crutzen 
showed that naturally occurring nitrogen oxides catalytically destroy ozone. Rowland 
and Molina recognized in 1974 that chlorine from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) may 
deplete the ozone layer. These substances, principally CFCl3 and CF2Cl2, do not occur 
in nature and have been widely used as propellants in spray cans, as refrigerant and 
air-conditioner gases, and as foaming agents for plastics. They are virtually unreactive in 
the lower atmosphere. Furthermore, they are relatively insoluble in water and are there-
fore not removed from the atmosph
