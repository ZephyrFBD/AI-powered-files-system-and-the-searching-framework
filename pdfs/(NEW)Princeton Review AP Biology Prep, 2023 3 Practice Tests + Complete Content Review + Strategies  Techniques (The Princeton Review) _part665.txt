be the source of the finch dwellings.
The source of the burrows must come from some other animal on the island. Small rodents could dig the burrows
which the finches live in opportunistically, either simultaneously or after the rodents have abandoned the burrows.
b. Describe the relationship between the finches and rodents on the island.
The finches and the rodents have a symbiotic relationship. The rodents may provide shelters for the birds and the
birds spread seeds which will eventually develop into a food source for the rodents as well. This describes a mutualistic
behavior. Otherwise, the relationship could be commensalistic where the birds benefit but the rodents do not benefit
from the birds.
c. Protein HITB8 is found to be present in high levels in medium-sized beak finches and less so in other finch
types. Predict what will happen to the frequency of this protein product in the finch population after two
generations if the drought continues.
The protein HITB8 will decrease in
