 the Purkinje fiber?
a.
The atria and ventricles would contract at the
same time.
b.
The ventricles would not contract.
c.
The atria would contract first, followed by the
ventricles.
d.
Only the left atrium would contract.

The diagram shows the neural structures that control and
coordinate the beating of the heart. Explain fully how the
cardiac cycle would be affected if the signal was blocked
at the atrioventricular node and why.
a.
The atria would contract, but the ventricles
would not, because the atrioventricular node
passes signals to the Purkinje fibers, which allow
the ventricles to contract.
b.
The ventricles would contract, but the atria
would not, because the atrioventricular node
passes the signal to the Purkinje fibers, which
allow the ventricles to contract.
c.
The atria would contract, but the ventricles
would not, because the atrioventricular node
passes the signal to the Purkinje fibers, which
allow the atria to contract.
d.
The ventricles would contract, but the at
