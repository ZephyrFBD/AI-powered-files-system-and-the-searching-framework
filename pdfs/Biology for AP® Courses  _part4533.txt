capacity of their environment, which enables
more people survive. By decreasing their own
carrying capacity, humans are responsible for
their population boom.
c.
Humans have been able to change the carrying
capacity of their environment, which enables
more people to live. By increasing their own
carrying capacity, humans are responsible for
their population boom.
d.
Humans can increase the carrying capacity of
their environment by developing food
production methods and engineering high
quality shelters, which enables fewer people to
live than would otherwise be possible. This
would result in population collapse.
66. The Industrial Revolution began with the invention of
the steam engine. At about the same time, human
population began increasing exponentially. Explain how
these two events are linked to the idea that humans are
able to change the carrying capacity of their environment.
a.
The invention of the steam engine enabled
people to use machines to carry out farming
activities. T
