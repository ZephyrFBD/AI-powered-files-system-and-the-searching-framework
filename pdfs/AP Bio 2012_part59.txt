H2O 
  If the input water is labeled with a radioactive isotope of 
oxygen, 18O, then the oxygen gas released as the reaction 
proceeds is also labeled with 18O. Which of the following is 
the most likely explanation? 
(A) During the light reactions of photosynthesis, water is 
split, the hydrogen atoms combine with the CO2, and 
oxygen gas is released. 
(B) During the light reactions of photosynthesis, water is 
split, removing electrons and protons, and oxygen gas is 
released. 
(C) During the Calvin cycle, water is split, regenerating 
NADPH from NADP+, and oxygen gas is released. 
(D) During the Calvin cycle, water is split, the hydrogen 
atoms are added to intermediates of sugar synthesis, and 
oxygen gas is released.
