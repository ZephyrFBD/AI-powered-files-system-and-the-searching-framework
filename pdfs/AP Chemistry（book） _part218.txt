struments like trumpets and trombones are made 
from an alloy called brass. Brass is composed of copper and 
zinc atoms and appears homogeneous under an optical mi-
croscope. The approximate composition of most brass objects 
is a 2:1 ratio of copper to zinc atoms, but the exact ratio var-
ies somewhat from one piece of brass to another. (a) Would
