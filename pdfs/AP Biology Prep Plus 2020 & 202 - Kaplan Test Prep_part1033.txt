14. A
The best example of cohesion would illustrate the preference of the fluid molecules for
other fluid molecules—meaning the correct answer will show the fluid sticking together
and forming a convex meniscus, instead of sticking to the container and forming a
concave meniscus (which would exhibit adhesion). (A) is thus correct.
15. C
Although both figures show that rates of photosynthesis and respiration tended to be
higher when mycorrhizae were present, the error bars indicate that there really was no
diﬀerence in terms of photosynthesis, because of the overlapping confidence intervals
for the two treatments. This eliminates (A) and (B). The figures do show a diﬀerence
between the two treatments in terms of respiration, ruling out (D) and making (C)
correct.
16. D
Most land plants form mutualistic symbioses with mycorrhizae; it is thought that the two
groups evolved together. Both organisms typically benefit from the association. (D) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect becaus
