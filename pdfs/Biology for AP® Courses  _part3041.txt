ed endings called axon terminals.
These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow
signals to be communicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine
cells in the retina, do not contain any axons. Some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize
dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This insulation is
important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter—from the base of the spine to the toes. The
myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in
the myelin sheath. These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along
the axon.
It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone—neuronal communication depends on
