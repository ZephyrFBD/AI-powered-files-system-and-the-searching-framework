 states that
The dots represent all the terms we did not write down. All the segments are the
same distance from the wire, so by symmetry we expect B to be the same at each
segment. We can then factor out B from the sum:
The sum of the segment lengths 
equals the circumference of the circle,
Thus
we have
or
This is just Eq. 20–6 for the magnetic field near a long straight wire, so Ampère’s
law agrees with experiment in this case.
A great many experiments indicate that Ampère’s law is valid in general.
Practically, it can be used to calculate the magnetic field mainly for simple or
symmetric situations. Its importance is that it relates the magnetic field to the
current in a direct and mathematically elegant way. Ampère’s law is considered
one of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism. It is valid for any situation
where the currents and fields are not changing in time.
Field Inside a Solenoid
We now use Ampère’s law to calculate the magnetic field inside a solenoid
(Section 20–7),
