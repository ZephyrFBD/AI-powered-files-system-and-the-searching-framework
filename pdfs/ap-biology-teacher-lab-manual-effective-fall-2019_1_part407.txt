 to correct the readings of the respirometers containing seeds 
with the readings taken from respirometers containing only glass beads? Your 
answer should refer to the concepts derived from the general gas law: 
PV = nRT 
Where 
P = pressure of the gas  
V = volume of the gas  
n = number of moles of the gas  
R = the gas constant (its value is fixed)  
T = temperature of the gas  
2. What happens to the volume of the gas being measured (O2 consumption or CO2 
production) when the temperature or pressure changes during the experiment? 
If pressure and temperature remain constant, will the volume of gas in the 
respirometers increase or decrease? Please explain. 
Hint: Several tutorials and animations explaining the general gas law are available 
online (e.g., http://www.nclark.net/GasLaws). 
3. Imagine that you are given 25 germinating pea seeds that have been placed in boiling 
water for five minutes. You place these seeds in a respirometer and collect data.
