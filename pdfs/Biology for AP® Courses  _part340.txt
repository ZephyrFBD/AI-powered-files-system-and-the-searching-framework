. This is known as the base complementary
rule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the
complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in
a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand.

Figure 3.35 In a double stranded DNA molecule, the two strands run antiparallel to one another so that one strand
runs 5′ to 3′ and the other 3′ to 5′. The phosphate backbone is located on the outside, and the bases are in the
middle. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds (or base pairs) with thymine, and guanine base pairs with cytosine.
A mutation occurs, and cytosine is replaced with adenine. What impact do you think this will have on the DNA
structure?
a.
The DNA will normally pair its adenine with thymine,
