Some organisms have more than the normal two complete sets of
chromosomes (2n) in all their somatic cells. The general term for
this chromosomal aberration is polyploidy. If the organism has three
sets of chromosomes, the abnormality is known as triploidy. If the
organism has four sets of chromosomes, the abnormality is known
as tetraploidy. Polyploidy is rare in animals, but common in plants.
Describe, in terms of alleles, how a triploid cell is different
from a diploid cell. (You may draw and label
