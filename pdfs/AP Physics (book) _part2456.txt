e wire is not set up
immediately at all points along the wires. This is based on the same argument we
used in Section 22–2 with reference to Fig. 22–5. Indeed, it can be shown that if
the wires are separated by empty space or air, the electrical signal travels along the
wires at the speed
For example, when you flip a light switch,
the light actually goes on a tiny fraction of a second later. If the wires are in a medium
whose electric permittivity is 
and magnetic permeability is 
(Sections 17–8 and
20–12, respectively), the speed is not given by Eq. 22–3, but by
instead.

Electromagnetic Waves
Phone call time lag. You make a telephone
call from New York to a friend in London. Estimate how long it will take the
electrical signal generated by your voice to reach London, assuming the signal
is (a) carried on a telephone cable under the Atlantic Ocean, and (b) sent via
satellite 36,000 km above the ocean. Would there be a noticeable delay in
