processes that simulate lightning strikes or volcanic
eruptions (Miller, Science, 117, 1953; Johnson et al.,
Science, 322, 2008).
A. The synthesis of amino acids in solutions under
laboratory conditions consistent with early Earth was a
step toward an explanation of how life began. Pose a
question that should have been asked but was not until
2014 (Parker et al., Angewandte Chemie, 53, 2014), when
these solutions that had been stored in a refrigerator were
analyzed.
The diversity and complexity of life begins in the variety
of sequences of the 20 common amino acids.
B. Apply mathematical reasoning to explain the source of
biocomplexity by calculating the possible variations in a
polymer composed of just three amino acids.
Polarity in a bond between atoms occurs when electrons
are distributed unequally. Polarity in a molecule also is
caused by charge asymmetry. Life on Earth has evolved
within a framework of water, H2O, one of the most polar
molecules. The polarities of the amino acids
