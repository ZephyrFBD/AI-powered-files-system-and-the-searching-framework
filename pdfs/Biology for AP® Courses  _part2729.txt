d mesophyll and vascular tissue, which make up the inner portion
of the leaf. In some plant species, leaf form is modified to form structures such as tendrils, spines, bud scales, and needles.
23.5 Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants
Water potential (Ψ) is a measure of the difference in potential energy between a water sample and pure water. The water

potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and matric potential. Water potential
and transpiration influence how water is transported through the xylem in plants. These processes are regulated by
stomatal opening and closing. Photosynthates (mainly sucrose) move from sources to sinks through the plant’s phloem.
Sucrose is actively loaded into the sieve-tube elements of the phloem. The increased solute concentration causes water to
move by osmosis from the xylem into the
