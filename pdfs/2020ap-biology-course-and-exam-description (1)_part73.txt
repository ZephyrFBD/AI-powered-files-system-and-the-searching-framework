ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.C.1
Directionality of the subcomponents influences 
structure and function of the polymer—
a.	Nucleic acids have a linear sequence of 
nucleotides that have ends, defined by the 3’ 
hydroxyl and 5’ phosphates of the sugar in the 
nucleotide. During DNA and RNA synthesis, 
nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the 
growing strand, resulting in the formation of a 
covalent bond between nucleotides.
b.	DNA is structured as an antiparallel double 
helix, with each strand running in opposite 
5’ to 3’ orientation. Adenine nucleotides 
pair with thymine nucleotides via two 
hydrogen bonds. Cytosine nucleotides 
pair with guanine nucleotides by three 
hydrogen bonds. 
c.	Proteins comprise linear chains of amino 
acids, connected by the formation of 
covalent bonds at the carboxyl term
