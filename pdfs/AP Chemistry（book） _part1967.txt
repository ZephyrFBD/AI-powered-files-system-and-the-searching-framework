 
and possess low melting points. The melting point depends on the 
strength of the intermolecular forces, as well as the efficiency with 
which the molecules can pack together.
COVALENT-NETWORK SOLIDS (SECTION 12.7) Covalent-network 
solids consist of atoms held together in large networks by cova-
lent bonds. These solids are much harder and have higher melting 
points than molecular solids. Important examples include dia-
mond, where the carbons are tetrahedrally coordinated to each 
other, and graphite, where the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms form 
hexagonal layers. Semiconductors are solids that do conduct elec-
tricity, but to a far lesser extent than metals. Insulators do not con-
duct electricity at all.
Elemental semiconductors, like Si and Ge, as well as compound 
semiconductors, like GaAs, InP
, and CdTe, are important examples of 
covalent-network solids. In a semiconductor the filled bonding mo-
lecular orbitals make up the valence band, while the empty antibond-
ing molecula
