 It reacts with 
chlorine to give a brittle white solid. The substance can be 
pounded into thin sheets or drawn into wires. It is a good 
conductor of electricity. Which of these characteristics are 
physical properties, and which are chemical properties?
 1.20  (a) Read the following description of the element zinc and 
indicate which are physical properties and which are chemi-
cal properties.
 
 Zinc melts at 420 °C. When zinc granules are added to dilute 
sulfuric acid, hydrogen is given off and the metal dissolves. 
Zinc has a hardness on the Mohs scale of 2.5 and a density of 
7.13 g>cm3 at 25 °C. It reacts slowly with oxygen gas at ele-
vated temperatures to form zinc oxide, ZnO.
 
 (b) Which properties of zinc can you describe from the 
photo? Are these physical or chemical properties?
 1.21  Label each of the following as either a physical process or a 
chemical process: (a) rusting of a metal can, (b) boiling a cup 
of water, (c) pulverizing an aspirin, (d) digesting a candy
