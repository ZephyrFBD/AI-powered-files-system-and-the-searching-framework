Sound Level
Because of this relationship between the subjective sensation of loudness and the phys-
ically measurable quantity “intensity,”sound intensity levels are usually specified on a
logarithmic scale. The unit on this scale is a bel, after the inventor Alexander Graham
Bell, or much more commonly, the decibel (dB), which is bel
