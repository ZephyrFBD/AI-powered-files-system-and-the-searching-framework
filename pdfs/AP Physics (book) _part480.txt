The possibility of skidding is worse if the wheels lock (stop rotating) when the
brakes are applied too hard. When the tires are rolling, static friction exists. But 
if the wheels lock (stop rotating), the tires slide and the friction force, which is
now kinetic friction, is less. More importantly, the direction of the friction force
changes suddenly if the wheels lock. Static friction can point perpendicular to the
velocity, as in Fig. 5–13b; but if the car slides, kinetic friction points opposite to
the velocity. The force no longer points toward the center of the circle, and the car
cannot continue in a curved path (see Fig. 5–12). Even worse, if the road is wet 
or icy, locking of the wheels occurs with less force on the brake pedal since there 
is less road friction to keep the wheels turning rather than sliding. Antilock brakes
(ABS) are designed to limit brake pressure just before the point
