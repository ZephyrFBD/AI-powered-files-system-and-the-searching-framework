universe tends toward disorder (entropy).
In order to power cellular processes, energy input must exceed energy loss to maintain order. Cellular processes that
release energy can be coupled with cellular processes that require an input of energy. Many pathways are sequential
to make energy transfer more efficient. A product of one step is often a reactant for the next step in a process. A lack
of energy flow or order results in death for an organism.
Types of Reactions
Exergonic reactions are those in which the products have less energy than the reactants. Simply put, energy is
given off during the reaction.
Let’s look at an example. The course of a reaction can be represented by an energy diagram. Here’s an energy
diagram for an exergonic reaction.
You’ll notice that energy is represented along the y-axis. Based on the diagram, we see that our reaction released
energy. An example of an exergonic reaction is the oxidizing of molecules in mitochondria of cells, which then
