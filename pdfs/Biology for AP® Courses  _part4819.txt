asing because of the
increased mobility of human populations and growing global trade and transportation. Climate change is forcing range
changes that may lead to extinction. It is also affecting adaptations to the timing of resource availability that negatively
affects species in seasonal environments. The impacts of climate change are greatest in the arctic. Global warming will
also raise sea levels, eliminating some islands and reducing the area of all others.
38.4 Preserving Biodiversity
