e efficiency. Because the amount of product
produced in the presence of compound X is greater than the amount of product produced in the absence of
compound X, compound X is most likely a cofactor of amylase.
(c)
(d) At reduced temperatures, there are fewer molecular collisions between the enzyme and the substrate as a
result of the reduced kinetic energy at lower temperatures. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the
reaction rate at 10°C would be slower than that of either 37°C measurement and thus that line is lower on
the graph than the other two lines.

Overview
Some organisms consume other organisms to obtain organic molecules—these are called heterotrophs. Organisms
that can produce their own organic molecules from inorganic molecules are called autotrophs. Autotrophs that use
light energy to power this process are called photoa
