plasmid 
containing the gene for resistance to the ampicillin (ampr) and, when exposed 
to ampicillin, did not grow on Plate II.
(B)
This option is incorrect. In a typical transformation experiment, if all procedures 
were followed as in this experiment, it is unlikely for a procedure to kill the 
bacteria. Plate IV indicates that the transformation procedure did not kill the 
bacteria.
(C)
This option is incorrect. Nutrient agar promotes E. coli growth.
(D)
This option is incorrect. The bacteria in Plate II were not exposed to the plasmid 
and thus could not have been transformed.
