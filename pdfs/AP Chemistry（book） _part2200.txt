reaction order of 
1 + 1 = 2, and the reaction is second order overall.
The exponents in a rate law indicate how the rate is affected by each reactant con-
centration. Because the rate at which NH4
+ reacts with NO2
-  depends on 3NH4
+4 raised to 
the first power, the rate doubles when 3NH4
+4 doubles, triples when 3NH4
+4 triples, and 
so forth. Doubling or tripling 3NO2
-4 likewise doubles or triples the rate. If a rate law is 
second order with respect to a reactant, 3A42, then doubling the concentration of that 
substance causes the reaction rate to quadruple because 3242 = 4, whereas tripling the 
concentration causes the rate to increase ninefold: 3342 = 9.
The following are some additional examples of experimentally determined rate laws:

          H21g2 + I21g2 ยก 2 HI1g2 
    
    Rate = k3H243I24
