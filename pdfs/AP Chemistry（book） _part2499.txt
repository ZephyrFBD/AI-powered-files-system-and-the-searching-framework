tion of iron oxide by 
carbon monoxide is a limited reaction. Acquaintance with 
the laws of chemical equilibrium would have permitted the 
same conclusion to be reached more rapidly and far more 
economically.” What does this anecdote tell us about the 
equilibrium constant for this reaction?
 [15.89] At 700 K, the equilibrium constant for the reaction
CCl41g2 ∆ C1s2 + 2 Cl21g2
is Kp = 0.76. A ﬂask is charged with 2.00 atm of CCl4, 
which then reaches equilibrium at 700 K. (a) What
