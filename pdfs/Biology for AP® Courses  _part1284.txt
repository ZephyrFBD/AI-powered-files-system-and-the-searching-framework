s); this is referred to as discontinuous variation.
Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring,
nor were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on. In 1868, Mendel became abbot
of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary
scientific contributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and
revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.
Mendel’s Model System
Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, to study inheritance. This species naturally
self-fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after
pollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or “tru
