when it returns to the thrower’s hand
(point C).
APPROACH Again we assume the acceleration is constant, so we can use 
Eqs. 2–11. We have the maximum height of 11.5 m and initial speed of 
from Example 2–12. Again we take y as positive upward.
SOLUTION (a) We consider the time interval between the throw
and the top of the path  
and we want
to find 
The acceleration is constant at
Both 
Eqs. 2–11a and 2–11b contain the time with other quantities known. Let us
use Eq. 2–11a with  
and  
setting
gives
, which we rearrange to solve for :
or
This is just half the time it takes the ball to go up and fall back to its original
position [3.06 s, calculated in Example 2–13]. Thus it takes the same time to
reach the maximum height as to fall back to the starting point.
(b) Now we consider the time interval from the throw  
until the ball’s return to the hand, which occurs at  
(as calculated in
Example 2–13), and we want to find 
when  
NOTE The ball has the same speed (magnitude of velocity) wh
