ular response that may be stimulatory or inhibitory.
Produce the second messengers IP3 and DAG. If the effector
protein is the transmembrane enzyme phospholipase C, the
 
enzyme cleaves a membrane phospholipid, PIP2, to generate two
 
second messengers—IP3 and DAG. DAG, the lipid portion of
 
PIP2, remains embedded in the membrane, while the soluble IP3 moves into the cytoplasm. As second messengers,
IP3 and DAG
 
initiate a variety of cellular responses, depending upon cell type. Produce the second messenger Ca2+. In many
cells, IP3 triggers
 
the transport of calcium ions (Ca2+) across membranes. For example, in secretory cells of salivary glands, IP3 binds
and
 
activates receptor proteins in membranes of the smooth ER to
 
release Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Here, Ca2+ is a second
 
messenger, triggering the release of saliva.
5. GPCR signaling is deactivated when GTP is hydrolyzed (not shown in figure). When the GTP that is attached
to the effector protein is hydrolyzed (GTP → GDP +
