met orbits the Sun roughly once every
76 years. It comes very close to the surface of the Sun on
its closest approach (Fig. 5–45). Estimate the greatest 
distance of the comet from the Sun. Is it still “in” the 
solar system? What planet’s orbit is nearest when it is out
there?
vAvB?
66. (III) The comet Hale–Bopp has an orbital period of
2400 years. (a) What is its mean distance from the Sun? (b) At
its closest approach, the comet is about 1.0 AU from the Sun
(
from Earth to the Sun). What is the 
farthest distance? (c) What is the ratio of the speed at the
closest point to the speed at the farthest point?
1 AU = distance

67. Calculate the centripetal acceleration of the Earth in its
orbit around the Sun, and the net force exerted on the
Earth. What exerts this force on the Earth? Assume that 
the Earth’s orbit is a circle of radius
68. A flat puck (mass M) is revolved in a circle on a frictionless
air hockey table top, and is held in this orbit by a massless cord
