efore, it is very improper to construct a line graph consisting of an unbroken 
line without indicating the experimentally determined points. 
â–  BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR A GOOD GRAPH 
The following procedure applies primarily to graphs of experimental data that are going 
to be presented for critical evaluation. It does not apply to the kind of rough sketch that 
we often use for purposes of illustration. 
Every graph presented for serious consideration should have a good title that tells 
 
what the graph is about. Notice that we need more than just a title; we need a good title. 
Before we try to make a good title, let us look at an example and try to decide what kind 
of title is a useful one. Look at Figure A.4.

Figure A.4 
If you like pizza, it might be very useful to know when this party is being held. Without 
a title, you cannot tell even whether the graph refers to any particular party at all.
