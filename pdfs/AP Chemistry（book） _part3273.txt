uce or refine metals are based 
on electrolysis. Collectively, these processes are referred to as 
electrometallurgy. Electrometallurgical procedures can be broadly 
differentiated according to whether they involve electrolysis of a 
molten salt or of an aqueous solution.
Electrolytic methods using molten salts are important for 
obtaining the more active metals, such as sodium, magnesium, and 
aluminum. These metals cannot be obtained from aqueous solution 
because water is more easily reduced than the metal ions. The stan-

Historically, obtaining aluminum metal has been a challenge. 
It is obtained from bauxite ore, which is chemically treated to con-
centrate aluminum oxide 1Al2O32. The melting point of aluminum 
oxide is above 2000 °C, which is too high to permit
