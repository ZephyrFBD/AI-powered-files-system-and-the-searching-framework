n?), not to mention the sudden appearance of light.

Annihilation could continue, however, with antinucleons annihilating nucleons, until
almost no nucleons were left. But not quite zero. Somehow we need to explain our
present world of matter (nucleons and electrons) with very little antimatter in sight.
To explain our world of matter, we might suppose that earlier in the universe,
after the inflationary period, a slight excess of quarks over antiquarks was formed.†
This would have resulted in a slight excess of nucleons over antinucleons. And 
it is these “leftover” nucleons that we are made of today. The excess of nucleons
over antinucleons was probably about one part in 
During the hadron era,
there should have been about as many nucleons as photons. After it ended, the
“leftover” nucleons thus numbered only about one nucleon per 
photons, and
this ratio has persisted to this day. Protons, neutrons, and all other heavier particles
were thus tremendously reduced in number by about
