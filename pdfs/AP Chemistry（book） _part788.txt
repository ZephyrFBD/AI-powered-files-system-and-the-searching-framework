by forming eight C “ O 
bonds, two per molecule of CO2, and twelve O—H bonds, two per 
H2O molecule.
Solve Using Equation 5.32 and data from Table 5.4, we have
∆H = 312D1C ¬H2 + 2D1C ¬C2 + 7D1O “ O24
- 38D1C “O2 + 12D1O¬H24
= 3121413 kJ2 + 21348 kJ2 + 71495 kJ24
- 381799 kJ2 + 121463 kJ24
= 9117 kJ - 11948 kJ 
= -2831 kJ
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Use the average bond enthalpies in Table 5.4 to estimate ∆H  
for the “water splitting reaction”: H2O(g) ¡ H2(g) + ½ O2(g). 
(a) 242 kJ (b) 417 kJ (c) 5 kJ (d) -5 kJ (e) -468 kJ
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use the average bond enthalpies in Table 5.4 to estimate ∆H 
for the combustion of ethanol.

Because carbohydrates break down rapidly, their energy is quickly supplied to the body. 
However, the body stores only a very small amount of carbohydrates. The average fuel 
value of carbohydrates is 17 kJ>g 14 kcal>g2. Although fuel values rep
