ons. Live vaccines are usually made
by attenuating (weakening) the “wild-type” (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at
temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host. Adaptations to these new cells or temperatures
induce mutations in the genomes of the virus, allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause

disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host. These attenuated viruses thus still cause infection, but they do
not grow very well, allowing the immune response to develop in time to prevent major disease. Back mutations occur when
the vaccine undergoes mutations in the host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be
spread to other humans in an epidemic. This type of scenario happened as recently as 2007 in Nigeria where mutations in a
polio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in that country.
Some vaccines are in c
