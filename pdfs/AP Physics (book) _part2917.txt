in jet planes. The speed of the planes 
was much less than c, so the clocks
had to be accurate to nanoseconds 
in order to detect any time dilation.
They were this accurate, and they confirmed Eqs.26–1 to within experimental error.
Time dilation had been confirmed decades earlier, however, by observations on
“elementary particles”which have very small masses (typically 
to 
) and
so require little energy to be accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light, c.
Many of these elementary particles are not stable and decay after a time into
lighter particles. One example is the muon, whose mean lifetime is 
when at
rest. Careful experiments showed that when a muon is traveling at high speeds,
its lifetime is measured to be longer than when it is at rest, just as predicted by the
time dilation formula.

lifetime of a muon as measured in the laboratory if it is traveling at
