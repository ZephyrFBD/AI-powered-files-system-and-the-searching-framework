CHAPTER 9 Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
Although it is possible to make p bonds from d orbitals, the only p bonds we will 
consider are those formed by the overlap of p orbitals. These p bonds can form only if 
unhybridized p orbitals are present on the bonded atoms. Therefore, only atoms having 
sp or sp2 hybridization can form p bonds. Further, double and triple bonds (and hence p 
bonds) are more common in molecules made up of period 2 atoms, especially C, N, and 
O. Larger atoms, such as S, P
, and Si, form p bonds less readily.
