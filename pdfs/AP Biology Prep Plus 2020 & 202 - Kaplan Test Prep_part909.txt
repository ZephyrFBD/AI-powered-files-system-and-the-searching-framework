Indicators are chemicals that change color in the presence of specific
substances such as proteins, monosaccharides, and lipids. A more intense color
indicates a greater concentration of macromolecule. Benedict’s test identifies
molecules that have a ketone or aldehyde group (such as found in aldoses and
ketoses), the Biuret test determines the presence of peptide bonds, and Sudan III
is a dye used for staining triglycerides. The following table shows the negative
and positive results of each test.
