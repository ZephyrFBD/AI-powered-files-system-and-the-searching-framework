each rate law follows directly from the molecularity of the reaction. It is important to 
remember, however, that we cannot tell by merely looking at a balanced, overall chemi-
cal equation whether the reaction involves one or several elementary steps.

If the following reaction occurs in a single elementary reaction, predict its rate law:
H21g2 + Br21g2 ¡ 2 HBr1g2
Sample Exercise 14.13
 Predicting the Rate Law for an Elementary Reaction
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the equation and asked for its rate law, as-
suming that it is an elementary process.
Plan Because we are assuming that the reaction occurs as a sin-
