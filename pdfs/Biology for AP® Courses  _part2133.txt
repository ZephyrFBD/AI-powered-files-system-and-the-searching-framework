evolution. You suspect there is
selection pressure on the color of the flower because bees seem to cluster around red flowers more often than blue
flowers. In a separate experiment, you discover that blue flower color is dominant to red flower color. In a field, you
count 600 blue flowers and 200 red flowers. Based on the H-W equation, what are the expected allele frequencies for
flower color?
Two years later, you revisit the same field and discover that out of 1,000 flowers, 650 are blue. Use the H–W equation
to determine if the population of flowers is undergoing evolution.

In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are the different types of variation in a population?
•
Why can only heritable variation be acted upon by natural selection?
•
How can genetic drift, the bottleneck effect, and the founder effect influence allele frequencies in a population?
•
How can gene flow, mutation, nonra
