habitats and trophic levels do not necessarily indicate common ancestry. Mammals also have amniotic eggs, so
choice (C) is incorrect.
3. (D) The DNA sequence of an organism is not affected by its environment or geological events, so it provides
reliable evidence for ancestry of organisms. Fossils do not necessarily show when a species originated, so
choice (A) is incorrect. Habitats and morphological characteristics can change during an organismâ€™s lifetime, so
choices (B) and (C) are incorrect.
4. (B) Species V is the outgroup because it has the greatest number of amino acid differences from the other
species. Species I and II have only one amino acid difference between them and are therefore closely related.
Species III and IV have only one amino acid difference between them and are therefore closely related. Choice
(A) is incorrect because species I is more closely related to species II (one amino acid difference) than species V
(15 amino acid differences). Species II has fewer amin
