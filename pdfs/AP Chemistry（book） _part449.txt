Molecular Formulas from Empirical Formulas
We can obtain the molecular formula for any compound from its empirical formula if we 
know either the molecular weight or the molar mass of the compound. The subscripts in 
the molecular formula of a substance are always whole-number multiples of the subscripts in its 
empirical formula.  
(Section 2.6) This multiple can be found by dividing the molecular 
weight by the empirical formula weight:
 
Whole@number multiple =
molecular weight
empirical formula weight 
[3.11] 
In Sample Exercise 3.13, for example, the empirical formula of ascorbic acid was de-
termined to be C3H4O3. This means the empirical formula weight is 3112.0 amu2 +
411.0 amu2 + 3116.0 amu2 = 88.0 amu. The experimentally determined molecular 
weight is 176 amu. Thus, we find the whole-number multiple that converts the empirical 
formula to the molecular formula by dividing
Whole@number multiple =
molecular weight
empirical formula weight = 176
