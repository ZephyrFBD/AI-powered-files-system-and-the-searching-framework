ld’s needs for
energy is not only technological, but also economic and political. A major factor
surely is to “conserve”—to minimize our energy use. “Reduce, reuse, recycle.”
Uranium fuel amount. Estimate the minimum amount of
that needs to undergo fission in order to run a 1000-MW power reactor per
year of continuous operation. Assume an efficiency (Chapter 15) of about 33%.
APPROACH At 33% efficiency, we need 
input.
Each fission releases about 200 MeV (Eq. 31–5), so we divide the energy for 
a year by 200 MeV to get the number of fissions needed per year. Then we 
multiply by the mass of one uranium atom.
SOLUTION For 1000 MW output, the total power generation needs to be
3000 MW, of which 2000 MW is dumped as “waste” heat. Thus the total energy
release in 
from fission needs to be about
If each fission releases 200 MeV of energy, the number of fissions required for a
year is
The mass of a single uranium atom is about 
so the total uranium mass needed is
or about a ton of
