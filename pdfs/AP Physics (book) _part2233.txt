Maximum and minimum torque are determined by the angle 
the coil
makes with the magnetic field.
SOLUTION The area of one loop of the coil is
The maximum torque occurs when the coil’s face is parallel to the magnetic
field, so
in Fig. 20–34c, and
in Eq. 20–10:
The minimum torque occurs if
for which
and then
from
Eq. 20–10.
NOTE If the coil is free to turn, it will rotate toward the orientation with u = 0°.
t = 0
u = 0°,
sin u = 0,

sin u = 1
u = 90°

20–10 Applications: Motors,
Loudspeakers, Galvanometers
There are many practical applications of the forces related to magnetism. Among
the most common are motors and loudspeakers. First we look at the galvanometer,
