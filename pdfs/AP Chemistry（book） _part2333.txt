How many elementary reactions are in the reaction 
mechanism? (b) How many intermediates are formed in 
the reaction? (c) Which step is rate limiting? (d) For the 
overall reaction, is ∆E positive, negative, or zero?
 14.71 The following mechanism has been proposed for the gas-
phase reaction of H2 with ICl:
 H21g2 + ICl1g2 ¡ HI1g2 + HCl1g2
HI1g2 + ICl1g2 ¡ I21g2 + HCl1g2
 
 (a) Write the balanced equation for the overall reaction. 
(b) Identify any intermediates in the mechanism. (c) If 
Time
(under conditions
of constant [Cl2])
1/[NO]
(a) Is the following mechanism consistent with the data?
 
   NO1g2 + Cl21g2 ∆NOCl21g2  1fast2
 
NOCl21g2 + NO1g2 ¡ 2 NOCl1g2  1slow2
(b) Does the linear plot guarantee that the overall rate 
law is second order?
 14.74 You have studied the gas-phase oxidation of HBr by O2:
4 HBr1g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1g2 + 2 Br21g2
 
 You find the reaction to be first order with respect to HBr 
and first order with respect to O2. You propose the follow-
ing mechanism:
