 we
see that the saturated vapor pressure of water at 20°C is 17.5 torr. Hence the 
relative humidity would be greater than 100%, and the supersaturated air cannot
hold this much water vapor. The excess water may condense and appear as dew,
clouds, or as fog or rain (Fig. 13–26).
When air containing a given amount of water is cooled, a temperature is
reached where the partial pressure of water equals the saturated vapor pressure.
This is called the dew point. Measurement of the dew point is the most accurate
means of determining the relative humidity. One method uses a polished metal sur-
face which is gradually cooled down while in contact with air. The temperature at
which moisture begins to appear on the surface is the dew point, and the partial
pressure of water can then be obtained from saturated vapor pressure Tables. If, for
example, on a given day the temperature is 20°C and the dew point is 5°C, then the
partial pressure of water (Table 13–3) in the 20°C air is 6.54 torr, wher
