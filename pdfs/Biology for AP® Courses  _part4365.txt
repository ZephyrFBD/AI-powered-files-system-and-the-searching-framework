 size; or negative, meaning the population is
decreasing in size; or zero, where the populationâ€™s size is unchanging, a condition known as zero population growth. A
further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase
(often thought of as the potential for reproduction), even under ideal conditions. Obviously, a bacterium can reproduce

more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human. The maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic
potential, or rmax, thus changing the equation to:
dN
dT = rmax N
Figure 36.9 When resources are unlimited, populations exhibit exponential growth, resulting in a J-shaped curve.
When resources are limited, populations exhibit logistic growth. In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as
resources become scarce, and it le
