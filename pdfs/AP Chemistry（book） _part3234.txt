able membranes. 
 (Section 13.5)
Cell walls are membranes with variable permeability with 
respect to a number of physiologically important ions (especially 
Na+, K+, and Ca2+). The concentrations of these ions are different for 
the ﬂuids inside the cells (the intracellular fluid, or ICF) and outside 
the cells (the extracellular fluid, or ECF). In cardiac muscle cells, for 
example, the concentrations of K+ in the ICF and ECF are typically 
about 135 millimolar (mM) and 4 mM, respectively. For Na+, however, 
the concentration difference between the ICF and ECF is opposite to 
that for K+; typically, 3Na+4ICF = 10 mM and 3Na+4ECF = 145 mM.
The cell membrane is initially permeable to K+ ions but is much 
less so to Na+ and Ca2+. The difference in concentration of K+ ions 
between the ICF and ECF generates a concentration cell. Even though 
the same ions are present on both sides of the membrane, there is a 
 
potential difference between the two ﬂuids that we can calculate using 
the N
