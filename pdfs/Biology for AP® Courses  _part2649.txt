transport of water and other nutrients.
You likely remember the concept of water potential (Ψ) from our exploration of diffusion and osmosis in the chapter where
we discuss the structure and function of plasma membranes. Water potential is a measure of the differences in potential
energy between a water sample with solutes and pure water. Water moves via osmosis from an area of higher water potential
(more water molecules, less solute) to an area of lower water potential (less water, more solutes). The water potential in
plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and other factors (matrix effects). Water potential
and transpiration influence how water is transported through the xylem.
Carbohydrates synthesized in photosynthesis, primarily sucrose, move from sources to sinks through the plant’s phloem.
Sucrose produced in the Calvin cycle is loaded into the sieve-tube elements of the phloem, and the increased solute
concentration causes water to move by os
