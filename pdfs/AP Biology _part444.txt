 of alleles into or out of a population. It can
occur as a result of the migration of fertile individuals or gametes between
populations. For example, pollen from one valley can be carried by the
wind across a mountain to another valley. Gene flow tends to increase
diversity.
Mutations
Mutations are changes in genetic material and are the raw material for
evolutionary change. They increase diversity. A single point mutation can
introduce a new allele into a population. Although mutations at one locus
are rare, the cumulative effect of mutations at all loci in a population can
be significant.
Nonrandom Mating
Individuals choose their mates for a specific reason. The selection of a
mate serves to eliminate the less-fit individuals. Snow geese exist in two
phenotypically distinct forms: white and blue. Blue geese tend to mate
with blue geese, and white geese tend to mate with white geese. If, for
some reason, the blue geese became more attractive and both blue and
white geese began mating
