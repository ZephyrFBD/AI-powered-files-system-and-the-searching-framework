Calculating Ka from ph
In order to calculate either the Ka value for a weak acid or the pH of its solutions, we 
will use many of the skills for solving equilibrium problems developed in Section 15.5. 
In many cases the small magnitude of Ka allows us to use approximations to simplify the 
problem. In doing these calculations, it is important to realize that proton-transfer reac-
tions are generally very rapid. As a result, the measu
