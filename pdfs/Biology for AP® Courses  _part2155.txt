eliminated from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether
or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and
reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can
have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype.
Nonrandom Mating
If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers, the result can be a changing population. There are many reasons
nonrandom mating occurs. One reason is simple mate choice; for example, female peahens may prefer peacocks with
bigger, brighter tails. Traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection. One
common form of mate choice, called assortative mating, is an individualâ€™s preference to mate with partners who are
phenotypically similar to themselves
