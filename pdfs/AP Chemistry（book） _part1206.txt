o are 
interested in studying Zn2+-containing proteins frequently 
substitute Cd2+ for Zn2+, since Cd2+ is easier to detect. (a) On 
the basis of the properties of the elements and ions discussed 
in this chapter and their positions in the periodic table, de-
scribe the pros and cons of using Cd2+ as a Zn2+ substitute. 
(b) Proteins that speed up (catalyze) chemical reactions are 
called enzymes. Many enzymes are required for proper met-
abolic reactions in the body. One problem with using Cd2+ 
to replace Zn2+ in enzymes is that Cd2+ substitution can de-
crease or even eliminate enzymatic activity. Can you suggest 
a different metal ion that might replace Zn2+ in enzymes in-
stead of Cd2+? Justify your answer.
 
[7.106] A historian discovers a nineteenth-century notebook in 
which some observations, dated 1822, were recorded on a 
substance thought to be a new element. Here are some of the 
data recorded in the notebook: â€œDuctile, silver-white, metal-
lic looking. Softer than lead. Un
