g, 29 g, 30 g, 30 g, 31 g, 32 g, 32 g, 32 g, 33 g, 34 g. The mean is
The median is the middle value, or 31 g. The mode is the most frequent number, or 32 g.
Example 2: In the following set of values, what is the range?
Values: −5, 8, 11, −1, 0, 4, 14
Solution: The smallest value in the set above is −5, and the largest is 14. The difference between these two is the
range, which is 19.
TYPES OF EXPERIMENTS OR QUESTIONS
You will be tested on scientific experiments and the scientific reasoning behind different aspects of the experiments
a LOT. You should be clear with the steps of the scientific method and know how to properly design an experiment
and recognize a poorly designed experiment. The following list should remind you:
Hypothesis: A well-thought-out prediction of what the outcome of the experiment will be.
Independent Variable: The factor that you, as the experimenter, will change between
