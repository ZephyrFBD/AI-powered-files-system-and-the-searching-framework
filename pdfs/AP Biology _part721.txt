If the membrane potential were measured at –75 mV, what would be
the value if the polarization across the membrane were increased?
–70 mV
–80 mV
zero
There would be no change because the membrane potential of a
particular neuron can never change.

by changing the duration of its action potentials
by changing the frequency of its action potentials
The axon does not respond differently to stimuli of different
intensities; an axon only responds in one way.

Chemical compounds known as organophosphates are the most widely
used pesticides in the world. They kill insects effectively. However, health
experts 
have 
raised 
concerns 
about 
their 
efficacy 
because
organophosphates are dangerous to humans
