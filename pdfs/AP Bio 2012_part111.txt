ch is produced by 
aerobic cellular respiration in mice.
Question 19
Essential Knowledge
2.A.1: All living systems require constant input of free 
energy.
2.A.2: Organisms capture and store free energy for use in 
biological processes. 
Science Practice
6.2: The student can construct explanations of phenomena 
based on evidence produced through scientific practices.
Learning Objective 
2.1: The student is able to explain how biological systems 
use free energy based on empirical data that all organisms 
require constant energy input to maintain organization, to 
grow, and to reproduce.
(A)
This option is incorrect because the rate of oxygen consumption is due to 
metabolic rates since oxygen is necessary for ATP production. Though size does 
affect heat gain and loss due to surface area to volume ratios, this physical trait 
would have the same effect in both organisms, not the opposite.
(B)
This option is incorrect because both crickets and mice are chemoheterotrophs.
(C)
This option
