er chromatids separate during metaphase of mitosis. Choice (A) is incorrect because in meiosis
there are two rounds of cell division, whereas in mitosis there is only one round of cell division.
Chromosomes are replicated during interphase in both meiosis and mitosis, so (C) is incorrect. Choice (D)
can also be eliminated because spindle fibers never form during interphase.

C
Amino acids are organic molecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, so eliminate (A),
(B), and (D). Donâ€™t forget to associate amino acids with nitrogen because of the amino group (NH2).

B
Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes (which include bacteria) do not contain membrane-bound organelles.
Bacteria contain circular double-stranded DNA, ribosomes, and a cell wall, so (A) and (D) are incorrect.
Also eliminate (C) because bacterial cell membranes are made up of a bilipid layer with proteins
interspersed.

D
Populations can be described as the evolutionary unit because changes in the genetic make
