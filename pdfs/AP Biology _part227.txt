st a gradient across the cristae membrane to the outer
compartment is endergonic. The first reaction powers the second
reaction. (ENE-1)
(C) The issue is one of energy conversion. In a hydroelectric power
plant, energy is converted from potential energy to mechanical
energy to electrical energy. In a mitochondrion, electrons flow down
the ETC, releasing energy along the way. This released energy is
converted to create a proton (H+) gradient across the cristae
membrane. As protons flow down the proton gradient through the
ATP synthase channel, the kinetic energy released is converted to
chemical bond energy. (ENE-1)
