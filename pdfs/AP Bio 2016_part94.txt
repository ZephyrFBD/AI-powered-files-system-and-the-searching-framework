125. A zucchini squash was peeled and cut into six identical cubes. 
After being weighed, each cube was soaked in a different 
sucrose solution for 24 hours in an open container and at a 
constant temperature of 21ºC. The cubes were then removed 
from the sucrose solutions, carefully blotted on paper towels, 
and weighed again. The percent change in mass (due to a net 
gain or loss of water) was calculated for each cube, and the 
results are shown in the graph below. A straight line is drawn 
on the graph to help in estimating results from other sucrose 
concentrations not tested. 
Using the straight line on the graph above, calcula
