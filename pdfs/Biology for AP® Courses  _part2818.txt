 occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation. Some desert
animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and
hummingbirds. While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller
and still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to
conserve energy during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.

Read about how scientists developed a method using today’s technology to collect data on heart rates
in hibernating bears at this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32bears) . Design an experiment that
would allow you to collect body temperature and heart rate at the same time. Discuss how combining data
on body temperature with heart rate can give you information on the animal’s overall metabol
