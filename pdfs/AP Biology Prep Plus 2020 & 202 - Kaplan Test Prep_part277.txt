9. Scientists have spent many years tracking the evolution of a
certain flowering plant in southern Florida. Recent flooding in the
area has caused regions of land that contain the plant to become
submerged under water. Already, this environmental change has
led to unexpected mutations that cause certain varieties of the
plant to thrive in the new conditions.
Given that terrestrial plants and aquatic plants oȇen use diﬀerent
mechanisms to reproduce, which of the following graphs best
illustrates the most likely change to the plant population that will
occur as a result of the flood?

10. As plants evolved, moving from aquatic environments to
terrestrial environments, they were forced to develop new
mechanisms to acquire and transport necessary nutrients and
resources. Which of the following provides an example of one of
these structural alterations?
Plants developed organelles known as lysosomes to
breakdown ma
