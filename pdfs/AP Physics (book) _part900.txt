88. A small mass m attached to the end of a string revolves in a
circle on a frictionless tabletop. The other end of the string
passes through a hole in the table (Fig. 8–62). Initially,
the mass revolves with a speed  
in a circle 
of radius 
The string is then pulled slowly
through the hole so that the radius is reduced to 
What is the speed,
of the mass now?
