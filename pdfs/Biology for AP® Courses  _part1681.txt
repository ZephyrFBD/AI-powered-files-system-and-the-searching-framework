ify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes
the initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or
terminate translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in
the proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to
the amino acid leucine.
As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package.
Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase
(see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.

The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The
corresponding amino acid mus
