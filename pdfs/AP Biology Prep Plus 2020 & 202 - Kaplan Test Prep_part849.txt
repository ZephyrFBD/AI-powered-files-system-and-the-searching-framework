 (D) is incorrect because nitrogen does not slow down plant
metabolism.

Small populations tend to experience a lot of inbreeding, which
increases their susceptibility to deleterious recessive alleles. By
introducing the Texas panthers, the researchers were able to increase
the genetic diversity in the population, increasing the chances that the
population will survive. (A) is thus correct. (B) is incorrect because the
genetic diﬀerences from the Texas subspecies actually helped to
promote the survival of the population, so the genetic diﬀerences did
matter. (C) is incorrect because there is no reason to suspect that the
Texas panthers would be better adapted to the environment than the
Florida panthers that had already evolved there. (D) is incorrect
because the population was not beyond saving.
