■ Summative Assessment 
The following are suggested as guidelines to assess students’ understanding of the 
concepts presented in the investigation, but you are encouraged to develop your own 
methods of postlab assessment. Some of the tasks can be assigned for homework 
following completion of the investigation. 
1. Have the students record their experimental design, data, results, and conclusions in 
a lab notebook, formal lab report, or mini-poster. Students can prepare a class graph 
reflecting their conclusions about the effects of environmental variables on the rate 
of transpiration in plants. Based on the students’ product, do you think students 
have met the learning objectives of the investigation? 
2. Were the students able to construct a graph from
