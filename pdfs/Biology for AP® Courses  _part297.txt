a curved shape. For clarity, the carbons are not shown. Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens associated with
it, also not shown.
The farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega (Ï‰) carbon, and if the double bond is
between the third and fourth carbon from that end, it is known as an omega-3 fatty acid. Nutritionally important because
the body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty
acids. Research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, reduce triglycerides in
the blood, lower blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. They also reduce inflammation, and
may help reduce the risk of some cancers in animals.
Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true th
