Lewis Symbols (Section 8.1)
 
8.9 (a) True or false: An elementâ€™s number of valence electrons 
is the same as its atomic number. (b) How many valence 
electrons does a nitrogen atom possess? (c) An atom has the 
electron configuration 1s22s22p63s23p2. How many valence 
electrons does the atom have?
 8.10 (a) True or false: The hydrogen atom is most stable when it 
has a full octet of electrons. (b) How many electrons must a 
sulfur atom gain to achieve an octet in its valence shell? (c) If 
an atom has the electron configuration 1s22s22p3, how many 
electrons must it gain to achieve an octet?
 8.11 Consider the element silicon, Si. (a) Write its electron con-
figuration. (b) How many valence electrons does a sili-
con atom have? (c) Which subshells hold the valence 
electrons?
 8.12 (a) Write the electron configuration for the element tita-
nium, Ti. How many valence electrons does this atom pos-
sess? (b) Hafnium, Hf, is also found in group 4B. Write 
the electron configuratio
