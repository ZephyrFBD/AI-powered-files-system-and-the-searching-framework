which makes it unsaturated. It increases LDL in
body.
d.

which contains double bonds in its structure. It
decreases HDL in the body.
48. How do phospholipids contribute to cell membrane
structure?
a.
Phospholipids orient their heads towards the
polar molecules and tails in the interior of the
membrane, thus forming a bilayer.
b.
Phospholipids orient their tails towards the polar
molecules of water solutions, and heads in the
interior of the membrane, thus forming a bilayer.
c.
Phospholipids orient their heads towards the
non-polar molecules and tails in the interior of
the membrane, forming a bilayer.
d.
Phospholipids orient their tails towards the polar
molecules and heads in the non-polar side of the
membrane, forming a bilayer.
