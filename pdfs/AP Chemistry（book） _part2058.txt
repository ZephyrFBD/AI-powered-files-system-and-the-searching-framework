of solution. Because 
the density of water is 1 g>mL, 1 kg of a dilute aqueous solution has a volume very close to 
1 L. Thus, 1 ppm also corresponds to 1 mg of solute per liter of aqueous solution.
The acceptable maximum concentrations of toxic or carcinogenic substances in 
the environment are often expressed in ppm or ppb. For example, the maximum allow-
able concentration of arsenic in drinking water in the United States is 0.010 ppm; that 
is, 0.010 mg of arsenic per liter of water. This concentration corresponds to 10 ppb.
Give It Some Thought
A solution of SO2 in water contains 0.00023 g of SO2 per liter of solution. What is 
the concentration of SO2 in ppm? In ppb?
(a) A solution is made by dissolving 13.5 g of glucose 1C6H12O62 in 0.100 kg of water. What is the mass percentage of solute in 
this solution?
(b) A 2.5-g sample of groundwater was found to contain 5.4 mg of Zn2+. What is the concentration of Zn2+ in parts per million?
