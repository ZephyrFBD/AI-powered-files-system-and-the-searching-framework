ached positions where the electric
field, and therefore the electric force on them, did become zero.
This reasoning has some interesting consequences. For one, any net charge on
a conductor distributes itself on the surface. For a negatively charged conductor,
you can imagine that the negative charges repel one another and race to the sur-
face to get as far from one another as possible. Another consequence is the following.
Suppose that a positive charge Q is surrounded by an isolated uncharged metal
conductor whose shape is a spherical shell, Fig. 16â€“34. Because there can be no
field within the metal, the lines leaving the central positive charge must end on
negative charges on the inner surface of the metal. That is, the encircled charge
induces an equal amount of negative charge,
on the inner surface of 
the spherical shell. Since the shell is neutral, a positive charge of the same
magnitude,
must exist on the outer surface of the shell. Thus, although no
field exists in the metal
