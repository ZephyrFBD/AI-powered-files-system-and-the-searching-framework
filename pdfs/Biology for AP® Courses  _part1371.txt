fspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino (Figure 12.20). In this case, the C gene
is epistatic to the A gene.
Figure 12.20 In mice, the mottled agouti coat color (A) is dominant to a solid coloration, such as black or gray. A gene
at a separate locus (C) is responsible for pigment production. The recessive c allele does not produce pigment, and a
mouse with the homozygous recessive cc genotype is albino regardless of the allele present at the A locus. Thus, the
C gene is epistatic to the A gene.
Epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is
expressed in this way. Homozygous recessive expression of the W gene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or
heterozygous expression of the Y gene (YY or Yy) generates yellow fruit, and the wwyy genotype produces green fruit.
However, if a dominant copy of the W gene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will
produce white
