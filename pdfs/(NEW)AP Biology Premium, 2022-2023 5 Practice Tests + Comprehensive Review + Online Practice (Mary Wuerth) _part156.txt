r, 
, and 
. Choices (B) and (D) are incorrect
because the Celsius temperature was used in the calculation instead of the Kelvin temperature. Avoid this
common mistake by remembering to always convert the temperature to Kelvin in water potential calculations.
Choice (D) also incorrectly used a value of 2.5 moles per liter instead of the correct value of 0.25 moles per liter
in the calculation. Avoid this type of mistake by carefully inputting numbers into your calculator when working
on calculations. In choice (A), an incorrect value of 0.025 moles per liter was used instead of 0.25 moles per
liter. Again, be careful when inputting numbers into your calculator. If time allows, you may want to repeat
calculations to confirm you inputted numbers correctly.
3. (B) Total water potential is ψ = ψs + ψp. Using the value –5.42 bars for ψs and 0.48 bars for ψp, then ψ = –5.42
bars + 0.48 bars = –4.94 bars. Choice (A) is incorrect because it is the value of ψs alone and doesn’t take into
