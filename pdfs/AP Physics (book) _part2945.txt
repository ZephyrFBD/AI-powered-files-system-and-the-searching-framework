, see Section 32–3) have often been
observed to collide and disappear, producing pure electromagnetic radiation. The
amount of electromagnetic energy produced is found to be exactly equal to that
predicted by Einstein’s formula,
The reverse process is also commonly
observed in the laboratory: electromagnetic radiation under certain conditions can
be converted into material particles such as electrons (see Section 27–6 on pair
production). On a larger scale, the energy produced in nuclear power plants is
a result of the loss in mass of the uranium fuel as it undergoes the process called
fission (Chapter 31). Even the radiant energy we receive from the Sun is an
example of 
the Sun’s mass is continually decreasing as it radiates
electromagnetic energy outward.
The relation
is now believed to apply to all processes, although the
changes are often too small to measure. That is, when the energy of a system
changes by an amount 
the mass of the system changes by an amount 
given by
