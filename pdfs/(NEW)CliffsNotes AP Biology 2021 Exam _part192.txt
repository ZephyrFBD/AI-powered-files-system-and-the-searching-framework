me), activating it.
4. Effector protein initiates response. The effector protein, now activated by the bound G protein, elicits a cellular
response. Some of the possible responses include the following:
Enzymatic activity. The effector protein may be an enzyme that catalyzes a specific substrate. More specifically, the
enzyme may be a protein kinase and initiate a kinase cascade.
Produce the second messenger cAMP. If the effector protein is the transmembrane enzyme adenylyl cyclase, the
enzyme converts an ATP to a cAMP by removing two phosphate groups (ATP → AMP + 2Pi) and binding the
remaining phosphate group
so that it is attached to the ribose sugar in two places instead of one (wrapping it around and making it “cyclic”).
Many cAMPs are rapidly produced, generating a very strong and rapid response. The cAMP signaling pathway then
activates a cytoplasmic response protein, such as an enzyme protein kinase. Depending upon the cell type, the
response protein initiates some specific cell
