 speed** increases. For ex-
ample, a car has greater kinetic energy moving at 65 miles per hour (mi/h) than it does at 
25 mi/h. For a given velocity, the kinetic energy increases with increasing mass. Thus, a 
large truck traveling at 65 mi/h has greater kinetic energy than a motorcycle traveling at 
the same velocity because the truck has the greater mass.
In chemistry we are interested in the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. 
Although these particles are too small to be seen, they have mass and are in motion, and 
therefore, possess kinetic energy. When a substance is heated, be it a pot of water on the 
stove or an aluminum can sitting in the sun, the atoms and molecules in that substance 
gain kinetic energy and their average speed increases. Hence, we see that the transfer of 
heat is simply the transfer of kinetic energy at the molecular level.
