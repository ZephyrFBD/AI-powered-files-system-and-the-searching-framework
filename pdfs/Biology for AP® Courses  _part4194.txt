ll as the density and state of water. Temperature exerts an
important influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 째C (32 째F) due to
metabolic constraints. It is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 째C (113 째F); this is a
reflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures. Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range
of temperatures; enzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures. Therefore, organisms either must maintain an

metabolism. Some animals have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations, such as seen
in hibernation or reptilian torpor. Similarly, some bacteria are adapted to surviving in extreme
