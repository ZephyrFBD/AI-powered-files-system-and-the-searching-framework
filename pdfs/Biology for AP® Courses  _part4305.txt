nologies that will help in
preventing temperature changes worldwide.
Using wind power and high efficiency natural
gas generation will help in achieving this goal.
55. As global temperatures change, many flowering plants
are flowering earlier. What change would most likely
occur if the insect pollinators are not around at the same
time?
a.
Insects will be deprived of their nectar, leading
to decrease in numbers; but flowering plants will
not be affected, as other animals will pollinate
them.
b.
Flowering plants will not be pollinated resulting
in their less population; but insects will not be
affected, as insects will feed on other organisms.
c.
Neither plants nor pollinators will be affected, as
new or different species of insects are going to
pollinate the flowering plants.
d.
Both plant and pollinator numbers would
decrease, as insects will be deprived of nectar
and plants will not be pollinated.

temperature in the next one hundred
