ve against infections caused by emergent diseases. Examples of bacteria-caused infections include pneumonia,
plague, typhoid, and Lyme disease. Although some diseases have been eradicated, the emergence of new infections, such as
MRSA, provides evidence that evolution is an ongoing process. Epidemiologists study how disease affects a population.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 3
of the AP速 Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP速 Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP速 exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
