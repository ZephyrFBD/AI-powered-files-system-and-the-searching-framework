me, of the cytoplasm.
Compare the two “cells” in Figure 3.3. The ratio of surface area of the
cell membrane compared to the total volume of the 1 mm cube (smaller
cell) is 6 to 1. The ratio of surface area to volume of the 5 mm cube (larger
cell) is only slightly more than 1 to 1. Clearly, the cell membrane of the
smaller cell will be faster and more efficient at supplying needed materials
and removing waste than the cell membrane of the larger cell. This is the
reason why multicelled organisms consist of millions of tiny cells carrying
out specialized functions rather than one gigantic all-purpose cell. In fact,
as a cell grows and the volume of the cytoplasm becomes too great for the
area of the cell membrane, a pathway is triggered and the cell divides in
two.
