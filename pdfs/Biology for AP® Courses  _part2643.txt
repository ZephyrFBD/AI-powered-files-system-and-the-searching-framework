 that a plant can obtain the required sunlight, water, soil
nutrients, and oxygen resources. Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to
thrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or more of these resources is in short supply.
In tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much
of the sunlight from reaching the forest floor. Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to
maximize the capture of sunlight. Other species are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve
as a physical support. Such plants are able to grow high up in the canopy atop the branches of other trees,
where sunlight is more plentiful. Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in the branches and leaves
of the supporting plant. Bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples of
tropical epiphytes (Figure 23.28). Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to e
