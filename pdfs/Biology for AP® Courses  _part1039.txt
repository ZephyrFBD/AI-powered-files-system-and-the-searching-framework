denylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme
called cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine
and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of
cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP
in different cells.

Figure 9.12 This diagram shows the mechanism for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP serves as a second
messenger to activate or inactivate proteins within the cell. Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called
phosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP.
Present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane, inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted i
