(a) Which colored balls must represent sodium ions? 
 
(b) Which colored balls must represent chloride ions? 
 
(c) Consider ion 5. How many attractive electrostatic in-
teractions are shown for it? (d) Consider ion 5. How many 
repulsive interactions are shown for it? (e) Is the sum of the at-
tractive interactions in part (c) larger or smaller than the sum 
of the repulsive interactions in part (d)? (f) If this pattern of 
ions was extended indefinitely in two dimensions, would the 
 
lattice energy be positive or negative? [Section 8.2]
