 
(c) Is the diagram consistent with the law of conservation of mass?
SOLUTION
(a) The left box, which represents reactants, contains two kinds 
of molecules, those composed of two oxygen atoms 1O22 and 
those composed of one nitrogen atom and one oxygen atom 
(NO). The right box, which represents products, contains only 
one kind of molecule, which is composed of one nitrogen 
atom and two oxygen atoms 1NO22.
(b) The unbalanced chemical equation is
O2 + NO ยก  NO2 1unbalanced2
 
An inventory of atoms on each side of the equation shows that 
there are one N and three O on the left side of the arrow and one N 
and two O on the right. To balance O, we must increase the num-
ber of O atoms on the right while keeping the coefficients for NO 
and NO2 equal. Sometimes a trial-and-error approach is required; 
we need to go back and forth several times from one side of an 
equation to the other, changing coefficients first on one side of 
the equation and then the other until it is balanced. In
