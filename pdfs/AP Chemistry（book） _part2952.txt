18.1  At 273 K and 1 atm pressure, 1 mol of an ideal gas occupies 
22.4 L. (Section 10.4) (a) Looking at Figure 18.1, predict 
whether a 1 mol sample of the atmosphere in the middle 
of the stratosphere would occupy a greater or smaller vol-
ume than 22.4 L (b) Looking at Figure 18.1, we see that the 
temperature is lower at 85 km altitude than at 50 km. Does 
this mean that one mole of an ideal gas would occupy less 
volume at 85 km than at 50 km? Explain. (c) In which 
parts of the atmosphere would you expect gases to behave 
most ideally (ignoring any photochemical reactions)?
