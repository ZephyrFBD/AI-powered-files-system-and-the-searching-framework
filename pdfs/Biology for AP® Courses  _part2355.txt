infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle. As youâ€™ve learned, some viruses are released when the host cell dies,
and other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell.
Figure 21.8 In influenza virus infection, glycoproteins attach to a host epithelial cell. As a result, the virus is
engulfed. RNA and proteins are made and assembled into new virions.
Influenza virus is packaged in a viral envelope that fuses with the plasma membrane. This way, the virus can exit the
host cell without killing it. What advantage does the virus gain by keeping the host cell alive?
a.
The virus can live dormant in the host cell.
b.
The virus capsid is upgraded.
c.
Lysis causes the host cell to die.
d.
The host cell can continue to make new virus particles.
