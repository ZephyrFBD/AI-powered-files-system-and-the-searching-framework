lecule of acetyl-CoA produced from the second stage of aerobic respiration
combining with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon molecule, to form a six-carbon molecule, citric acid or citrate (hence
its name, the citric acid cycle).
The Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. It begins with acetyl-CoA
joining with oxaloacetate to make citric acid and ends with oxaloacetate, 1
ATP, 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2; double this if you are counting per glucose.
Citrate gets turned into several other things, and because the cycle begins with a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate,
it eventually gets turned back into oxaloacetate to maintain the cycle by joining with the next acetyl-CoA coming
down the pipeline.
With each turn of the cycle, three types of energy are produced:
1 ATP
3 NADH
1 FADH2
To figure out the total number of products per molecule of glucose, we simply double the number of productsâ€”after
all, we started off the Krebs cycle with two molecules of acetyl-CoA for each molecule of glucose!
