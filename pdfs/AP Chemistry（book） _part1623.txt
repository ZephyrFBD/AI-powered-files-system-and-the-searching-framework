▲ Figure 10.15 An illustration of Graham’s law of effusion.
Because pressure and temperature are constant in this figure but volume 
changes, which other quantity in the ideal-gas equation must also change?

The fact that lighter molecules move at higher average speeds than 
more massive ones has many interesting applications. For exam-
ple, developing the atomic bomb during World War II required sci-
entists to separate the relatively low-abundance uranium isotope 
235U 10.7%2 from the much more abundant 238U 199.3%2. This sep-
aration was accomplished by converting the uranium into a volatile 
compound, UF6, that was then allowed to pass through a porous 
barrier (Figure 10.16). Because of the pore diameters, this process is 
not simple effusion. Nevertheless, the way in which rate of passing 
through the pores depends on molar mass is essentially the same as 
that in effusion. The slight difference in molar mass between 235UF
