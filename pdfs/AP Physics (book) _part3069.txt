r 13), the average kinetic
energy of atoms or molecules in a gas is given by Eq. 13–8:
where 
is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the kelvin
(absolute) temperature. Room temperature is about 
so
or, in electron volts:
The average 
of an atom as a whole is thus very small compared to the energy
between the ground state and the next higher energy state 
Any atoms in excited states quickly fall to the ground state and emit
light. Once in the ground state, collisions with other atoms can transfer energy
of only 0.04 eV on the average. A small fraction of atoms can have much more
energy (see Section 13–10 on the distribution of molecular speeds), but even a
kinetic energy that is 10 times the average is not nearly enough to excite atoms
into states above the ground state. Thus, at room temperature, practically all
atoms are in the ground state. Atoms can be excited to upper states by very high
temperatures, or by applying a high voltage so a current of high energy electrons
passes through the
