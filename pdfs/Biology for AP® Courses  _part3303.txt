chemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins) hormones. One of the key
distinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes whereas the amino acid-
derived and peptide hormones cannot.
Lipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones)
Most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in Figure 28.2. The
primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones. Chemically, these hormones are usually ketones or
alcohols; their chemical names will end in “-ol” for alcohols or “-one” for ketones. Examples of steroid hormones include
estradiol, which is an estrogen, or female sex hormone, a
