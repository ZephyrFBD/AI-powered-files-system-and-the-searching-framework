osphorylation, where electrons become
incorporated into NADPH, electrons in cyclic photophosphorylation return to PS I. Here they can be energized again
to participate in cyclic or noncyclic photophosphorylation. Cyclic photophosphorylation occurs simultaneously with
noncyclic photophosphorylation to generate additional ATP. Two electrons passing through cyclic
photophosphorylation generate, on average, about 1 ATP.
Calvin Cycle
The Calvin cycle “fixes” CO2. That is, it takes chemically unreactive, inorganic CO2and incorporates it into an
organic molecule that can be used
 
in biological systems. The biosynthetic pathway produces a single molecule
 
of glucose (C6H12O6). In order to accomplish this, the Calvin cycle must repeat six times, and use 6
CO2molecules. Thus, in Figure 5-1 and the
 
discussion that follows, all the molecules involved have been multiplied by6. Only the most important molecules are
discussed:
 
1. Carbon fixation: 6 CO2 combine with 6 RuBP to produce 12 PGA. The
