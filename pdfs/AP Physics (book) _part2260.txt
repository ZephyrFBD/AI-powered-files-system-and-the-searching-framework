 path the charged particle will take.
17. A charged particle moves in a straight line through a partic-
ular region of space. Could there be a nonzero magnetic field
in this region? If so, give two possible situations.
18. If a moving charged particle is deflected sideways in some
region of space, can we conclude, for certain, that 
in that region? Explain.

Question 12.
12. A positively charged particle in a nonuniform magnetic
field follows the trajectory shown in Fig. 20–49. Indicate
the direction of the magnetic field at points near the path,
assuming the path is always in the plane of the page, and
indicate the relative magnitudes of the field in each region.
