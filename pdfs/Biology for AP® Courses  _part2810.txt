to mature if molting does not occur at the proper time. The thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly
to accommodate any increase in weight. It is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of
eight. The increasing thickness of the chitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a
relatively small size. The same principles apply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached
on the outside, making it easier to compensate for increased mass.

Figure 24.3 Apodemes are ingrowths on arthropod exoskeletons to which muscles attach. The apodemes on this crab
leg are located above and below the fulcrum of the claw. Contraction of muscles attached to the apodemes pulls the
claw closed.
