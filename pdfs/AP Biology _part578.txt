Associative Learning
Associative learning is one type of learning in which one stimulus
becomes linked to another through experience. Examples of associative
learning are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.
Classical conditioning, a type of associative learning, is widely
accepted because of the ingenious work of Ivan Pavlov in the
1920s. Normally, dogs salivate when exposed to food. Pavlov
trained dogs to associate the sound of a bell with food. The result of
this conditioning was that dogs would salivate upon merely hearing
the sound of the bell, even though no food was present.
Operant conditioning, also called trial and error learning, is
another type of associative learning. An animal learns to associate
one of its own behaviors with a reward or punishment and then
repeats or avoids that behavior. The best-known studies involving
operant conditioning were done by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s. In
one study, a rat was placed int
