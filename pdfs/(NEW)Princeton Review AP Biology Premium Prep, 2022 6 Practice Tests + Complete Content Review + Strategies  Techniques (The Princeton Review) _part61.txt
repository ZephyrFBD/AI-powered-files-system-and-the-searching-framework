t is likely an inhibitor and high amounts of it would
decrease transcription. DRKFR is the only protein that significantly decreases Fursilla transcript levels
when overexpressed.
15.
B
Two proteins fitting together would not occur from similarities in their nucleotide sequences, which is
referenced in (A) and (C). As proteins, they should not be formed from lipids, so (D) is incorrect. Proteins
are formed from amino acids, and complementary conformations would allow them to bind together.

A
DRKFR is a transcriptional inhibitor, and it significantly decreases Fursilla transcript levels when
overexpressed. If BLD binds to the transcriptional inhibitor, DRKFR, then it would reduce inhibition and
increase the transcript levels of Fursilla.
17.
D
Solvents dissolve solutes that are similar to them, so polar solutes would no longer dissolve in water if
water turned nonpolar. Choice (B) is incorrect, because nonpolar molecules are more likely be found as
solids. Less liquid water would be
