The full-scale current sensitivity of a galvanometer,
is the
electric current needed to make the needle deflect full scale, typically about 
A galvanometer whose sensitivity 
is 
can measure currents from
about 
(currents smaller than this would be hard to read on the scale) up to
To measure larger currents, a resistor is placed in parallel with the
galvanometer. An analog ammeter, represented by the symbol 
, consists of a
galvanometer (
) in parallel with a resistor called the shunt resistor, as shown in
Fig. 19–31. (“Shunt” is a synonym for “in parallel.”) The shunt resistance is 
and the resistance of the galvanometer coil is r. The value of 
is chosen according
to the full-scale deflection desired;
is normally very small—giving an ammeter
a very small net resistance—so most of the current passes through 
and very
little 
passes through the galvanometer to deflect the needle.
