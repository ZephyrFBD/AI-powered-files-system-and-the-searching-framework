Since a cell depends on the cell membrane for an
exchange of nutrients and waste products, the ratio of cell volume to
membrane size is a major determinant of when the cell divides. See page
35.
Capacity of the Nucleus
The nucleus must be able to provide enough information to produce
adequate quantities of all substances to meet the cellâ€™s needs. As a result,
metabolically active cells are generally small. However, cells that have
evolved a strategy to exist as large, active cells do exist in several
kingdoms. Large, sophisticated cells like the paramecium have two nuclei
that each control different cell functions. Human skeletal muscle cells are
giant multinucleate cells. The fungus slime mold consists of one giant cell
that contains thousands of nuclei.
Phases of the Cell Cycle
The cell cycle consists of five major phases: G1, S, and G2 (which together
make up interphase), mitosis, and cytokinesis.
