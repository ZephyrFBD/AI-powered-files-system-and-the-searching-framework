lways a

The two strands of a DNA helix are antiparallel, that is, oriented in opposite directions. One strand is arranged in the
5′ → 3′ direction; that is, it begins with a phosphate group attached to the fifth carbon of the deoxyribose (5′ end)
and ends where the phosphate of the next nucleotide would attach, at the third deoxyribose carbon (3′) The adjacent
strand is oriented in the opposite, or 3′ → 5′, direction.
RNA differs from DNA in the following ways:
 
1. The sugar in the nucleotides that make an RNA molecule is ribose, not deoxyribose as it is in DNA.
2. The thymine nucleotide does not occur in RNA. It is replaced by uracil. When pairing of bases occurs in RNA,
uracil (instead of thymine) pairs with adenine.
3. RNA is usually single-stranded and does not form a double helix as it does in DNA.
