 the mutation for sickle cell
hemoglobin is most likely an example of which of the following?
A base-pair substitution
(A)
A frameshiȇ mutation
(B)
A silent mutation
(C)
A mutagen
(D)
55. Heterozygotes for the sickle cell trait have an increased resistance
to malaria. If malaria were eradicated and eﬀective treatment for
sickle cell anemia made universally available, what would be the
expected eﬀect on the sickle cell allele?
The frequency of the allele would remain roughly constant.
(A)
The frequency of the allele would decrease.
(B)
The frequency of the allele would increase.
(C)
The frequency of homozygous individuals would decrease,
but the frequency of heterozygous individuals would
increase.
(D)
56. Genetic mutations, such as the one found in the sickle cell anemia
allele, can be found in all organisms, from the simplest
prokaryotes to the most complex eukaryotes. However, these
mutations have a greater impact on the genetic diversity of
bacteria populations than on that of human
