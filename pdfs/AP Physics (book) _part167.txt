fety and traffic design.
The problem is best dealt with in two parts, two separate time intervals. (1) The
first time interval begins when the driver decides to hit the brakes, and ends 
when the foot touches the brake pedal. This is the “reaction time” during which
the speed is constant, so 
(2) The second time interval is the actual 
braking period when the vehicle slows down
and comes to a stop. The
stopping distance depends on the reaction time of the driver, the initial speed of
the car (the final speed is zero), and the deceleration of the car. For a dry road 
and good tires, good brakes can decelerate a car at a rate of about 
to
Calculate the total stopping distance for an initial velocity of 
and assume the acceleration of the car is
(the minus sign appears because the velocity is taken to be in the positive 
x direction and its magnitude is decreasing). Reaction time for normal drivers
varies from perhaps 0.3 s to about 1.0 s; take it to be 0.50 s.
