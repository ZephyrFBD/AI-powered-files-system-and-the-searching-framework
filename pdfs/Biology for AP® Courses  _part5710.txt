. Players interact within the limitations
laid out by the coding. In the same way those who wrote the codes
for the simulation decided the laws of physics that would apply.
These can be overridden by expanded states of consciousness, but
not by those enslaved in only ﬁve-sense awareness where simulation
codes rule. Overriding the codes is what people call ‘miracles’. They
are not. They are bypassing the encoded limits of the simulation. A
population caught in simulation perception would have no idea that
this was their plight. As the Bonn paper said: ‘Like a prisoner in a
pitch-black cell we would not be able to see the “walls” of our
prison,’ That’s true if people remain mesmerised by the ﬁve senses.
Open to expanded awareness and those walls become very clear. The
main one is the speed of light.
American theoretical physicist James Gates is another who has
explored the simulation question and found considerable evidence
to support the idea. Gates was Professor of Physics at the Unive
