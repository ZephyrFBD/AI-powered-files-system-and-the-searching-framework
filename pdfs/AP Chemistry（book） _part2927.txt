ns, from the wellheads contributes to 
air pollution. In a study published in 2013, methane emissions to the 
atmosphere during hydraulic fracking operations in Utah were esti-
mated to be in the range of 6–12% of the amount of methane pro-
duced. As related in the Closer Look box on page 783, methane is a 
potent greenhouse gas.
The many environmental issues surrounding the practice of 
fracking have generated widespread concern and adverse public 
reaction. Fracking represents yet one more instance of the conﬂict 
between those who advocate the availability of low cost energy and 
those who are more focused on sustaining long term the quality of 
the environment.

The HClO in turn reacts with organic substances to form THMs. Bromine enters the reac-
tion sequence through the reaction of HClO with dissolved bromide ion:
 
HClO1aq2 + Br-1aq2 ¡ HBrO1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 
[18.16]
Then both HBrO1aq2 and HClO1aq2 can halogenate organic substances to form th
