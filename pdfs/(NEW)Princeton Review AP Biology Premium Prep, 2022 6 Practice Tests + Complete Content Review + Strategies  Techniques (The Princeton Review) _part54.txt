Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationship of deer tick virus to other tick-borne encephalitis group viruses
In Figure 1, the values above branches indicate bootstrapped confidence values. Branch lengths are
proportional to percent similarity in viral envelope gene sequence. TBE: tick borne encephalitis; TSE: Turkish
sheep encephalitis; GGE: Greek goat encephalitis; LI: louping ill virus; SSE: Spanish sheep encephalitis; KFD:
Kyasanur Forest disease virus; TYU: Tyuleniy virus; SRE: Saumarez Reef virus.

(b) Identify two of the viruses that are LEAST similar to GGE.
(c) In 50 years, new data have identified
