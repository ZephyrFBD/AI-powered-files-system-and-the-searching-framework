63. Could the primitive atmosphere illustrated by the Urey
and Miller experiment be reproduced on todayâ€™s Earth?
Why or why not?
a.
The primitive atmosphere cannot be created due
to the oxidizing atmosphere and lack of
hydrogen.
b.
The primitive atmosphere can be created as the
atmosphere is reducing and the Earth has

c.
The primitive atmosphere cannot be created due
to the presence of abundant water and hydrogen
in the atmosphere.
d.
The primitive atmosphere can be created as the
