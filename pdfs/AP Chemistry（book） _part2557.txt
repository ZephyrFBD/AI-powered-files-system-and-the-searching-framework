ization = concentration of ionized HA
original concentration of HA * 100% 
[16.26]
The stronger the acid, the greater the percent ionization.
If we assume that the autoionization of H2O is negligible, the concentration of acid 
that ionizes equals the concentration of H+1aq2 that forms. Thus, the percent ionization 
for an acid HA can be expressed as
 
Percent ionization =
3H+4equilibrium
3HA4initial
* 100% 
[16.27]
For example, a 0.035 M solution of HNO2 contains 3.7 * 10-3 M H+1aq2 and its percent 
ionization is
 
Percent ionization =
3H+4equilibrium
3HNO24initial
* 100% = 3.7 * 10-3 M
0.035 M
* 100% = 11% 
As calculated in Sample Exercise 16.10, a 0.10 M solution of formic acid (HCOOH) contains 4.2 * 10-3 M H+1aq2. Calculate 
the percentage of the acid that is ionized.
