 periodic table is partitioned into different types of ele-
ments, based on their electron configurations. Those elements in 
which the outermost subshell is an s or p subshell are called the 
representative (or main-group) elements. Those elements in which a 
d subshell is being filled are called the transition elements (or tran-
sition metals). The elements in which the 4f subshell is being filled 
are called the lanthanide (or rare earth) elements. The actinide ele-
ments are those in which the 5f subshell is being filled. The lan-
thanide and actinide elements are collectively referred to as the 
f-block metals. These elements are shown as two rows of 14 ele-
ments below the main part of the periodic table. The structure of 
the periodic table, summarized in Figure 6.31, allows us to write 
the electron configuration of an element from its position in the 
periodic table.
