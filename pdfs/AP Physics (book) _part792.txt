ball reaches the bottom of the stairs?

Rotational Motion
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A solid ball and a solid cylinder roll down a ramp. They both start from rest at the
same time and place. Which gets to the bottom first?
(a) They get there at the same time.
(b) They get there at almost exactly the same time except for frictional differences.
(c) The ball gets there first.
(d) The cylinder gets there first.
(e) Can’t tell without knowing the mass and radius of each.

ntil now, we have been concerned mainly with translational motion. We
discussed the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion (the role 
of force). We also discussed the energy and momentum for translational
motion. In this Chapter we will deal with rotational motion. We will discuss the
kinematics of rotational
