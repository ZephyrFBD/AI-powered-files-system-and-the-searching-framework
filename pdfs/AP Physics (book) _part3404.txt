Electric charge, linear and angular momentum, mass–energy,
and nucleon number are conserved in all decays.
Radioactive decay is a statistical process. For a given type
of radioactive nucleus, the number of nuclei that decay 
in a time 
is proportional to the number N of parent nuclei
present:
(30;3a)
the minus sign means N decreases in time.
The proportionality constant is called the decay constant
and is characteristic of the given nucleus. The number N of
nuclei remaining after a time decreases exponentially,
(30;4)
as does the activity,
(30;5)
The half-life,
is the time required for half the nuclei of a
radioactive sample to decay. It is related to the decay constant
by
(30;6)
Radioactive dating is the use of radioactive decay to deter-
mine the age of certain objects, such as carbon dating.
