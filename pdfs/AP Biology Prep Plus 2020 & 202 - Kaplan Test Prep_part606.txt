ox genes because they no longer
possess a body plan with diï¬€erent segments.

12. Scientists investigated the events surrounding the attachment of
a sperm cell to an egg in a certain species of mouse. They found
that receptors on the sperm bound to glycoproteins displayed on
the zona pellucida of the egg. They also found that the mouse
sperm was unable to fertilize hamster eggs. Which of the following
is the most likely explanation for this experimental observation?
The enzymes of a mouse sperm cell cannot digest the zona
pellucida of a hamster egg.
(A)
The hamster egg secretes enzymes that kill sperm cells.
(B)
The glycoprotein receptors on sperm and egg are species-
specific.
(C)
The zygote produced from the mouse sperm and a hamster
egg could not undergo cell division and would degenerate.

13. Molecular biologists cloned the gene for protein X from a library of
mouse mRNA. They transformed a compatible cell line with two
vectors, one vector containing the cloned gene and a sec
