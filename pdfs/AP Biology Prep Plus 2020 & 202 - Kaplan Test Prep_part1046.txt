py of the universe. Entropy is also known as disorder, so
(C) is correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect because they suggest the opposite. (D) is incorrect
because it violates the first law of thermodynamics: energy can be neither created nor
destroyed.
41. D
The mutant lacking the C gene will be incapable of producing stamens and carpels, so
rule out all answers with those organs. According to the observation mentioned in the
last sentence, if a mutant lacks C-gene activity, then A-gene activity will spread
throughout. So expect only sepals and petals. The correct answer is (D).
42. A
To determine the answer, construct a Punnett square as follows:

According to the Punnett square, only 1 out of every 16 of the oﬀspring will have the rrss
genotype. Therefore, the probability of the rrss genotype is 1/16. Therefore, (A) is correct.
43. D
Sickle cell anemia results from a missense mutation,
