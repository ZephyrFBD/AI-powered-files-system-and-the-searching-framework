the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s recognition sites. These are sometimes referred to as “cell-specific”
proteins. The body recognizes its own proteins and attacks foreign proteins associated with invasive pathogens.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface of cells
and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids) (Figure 5.2). These carbohydrate
chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins,
carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other. These sites have unique
patterns that allow the cell to be recognized, much the way that the facial features unique to each person allow him or her to
be recognized. This recognition function is very important to cells, as it allows the immune system to differenti
