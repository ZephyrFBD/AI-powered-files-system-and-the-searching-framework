ess 
of bacterial strains isolated from naturally occurring populations. (1 point; LO 1.9) 
 
Description may include: 
• 
DNA sequence comparison between the two bacterial strains 
• 
RNA sequence comparison between the two bacterial strains 
• 
Protein sequence comparison between the two bacterial strains 
• 
Biochemical strategies comparison 
• 
Components of ribosomes comparison 
 
(b) Using the information presented in the graph, describe the relationship between antagonism and
genetic relatedness in the communities of Vibrio bacteria sampled for the study. (1 point; LO 4.12
 
) 
 
Description may include: 
• ↓ genetic distance  ↓ antagonism 
• ↑ genetic relatedness  ↓ antagonism 
• ↑ genetic distance  ↑ antagonism     
• ↓ genetic relatedness  ↑ antagonism 
• There is a threshold of genetic relatedness beyond which probability of antagonism 
increases sharply
