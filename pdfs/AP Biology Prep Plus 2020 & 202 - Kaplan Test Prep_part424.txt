6. An experiment was performed to examine the eﬀects of anaerobic
respiration in yeast. Yeast was suspended in various solutions
(containing water, pyruvate, glucose, sodium fluoride, and
magnesium sulfate), and CO2 production in mm (bubble height)
was measured aȇer incubation. The following data were obtained.

According to the data, yeast in solution with both sodium fluoride
and pyruvate produced more CO2 than yeast in solution with
sodium fluoride and no pyruvate. Which of the following
statements provides the most reasonable explanation for this
diﬀerence?
The yeast oxidized
