pproximate radius of an 
particle 
3. (I) By what % is the radius of 
greater than the radius
of
4. (II) (a) What is the approximate radius of a 
nucleus?
(b) Approximately what is the value of A for a nucleus
whose radius is 
5. (II) What is the mass of a bare 
particle (without elec-
trons) in 
6. (II) Suppose two alpha particles were held together so they
were just “touching”(use Eq.30–1). Estimate the electrostatic
repulsive force each would exert on the other. What would be
the acceleration of an alpha particle subjected to this force?
7. (II) (a) What would be the radius of the Earth if it had its
actual mass but had the density of nuclei? (b) By what
factor would the radius of a 
nucleus increase if it had
the Earth’s density?
8. (II) What stable nucleus has approximately half the radius
of a uranium nucleus? [Hint: Find A and use Appendix B
to get Z.]
9. (II) If an alpha particle were released from rest near the
surface of a 
nucleus, what would its kinetic energy
be when far a
