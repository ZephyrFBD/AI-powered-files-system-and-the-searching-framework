1–6 Converting Units
Any quantity we measure, such as a length, a speed, or an electric current,
consists of a number and a unit. Often we are given a quantity in one set of
units, but we want it expressed in another set of units. For example, suppose we
measure that a shelf is 21.5 inches wide, and we want to express this in centi-
meters. We must use a conversion factor, which in this case is, by definition, exactly
or, written another way,
Since multiplying by the number one does not change anything, the width of our
shelf, in cm, is
Note how the units (inches in this case) cancelled out (thin red lines). A Table
containing many unit conversions is found inside the front cover of this book.
Let’s consider some Examples.
The 8000-m peaks. There are only 14 peaks whose sum-
mits are over 8000 m above sea level. They are the tallest peaks in the 
world (Fig. 1–9 and Table 1–6) and are referred to as “eight-thousanders.”
What is the elevation, in feet, of an elevation of 8000 m?
