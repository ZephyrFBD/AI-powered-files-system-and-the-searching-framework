Composition of the Atmosphere
Earth’s atmosphere is constantly bombarded by radiation and energetic particles from 
the Sun. This barrage of energy has profound chemical and physical effects, especially 
in the upper regions of the atmosphere, above about 80 km (Figure 18.2). In addition, 
because of Earth’s gravitational field, heavier atoms and molecules tend to sink in the 
atmosphere, leaving lighter atoms and molecules at the top of the atmosphere. (This is 
why, as just noted, 75% of the atmosphere’s mass is in the troposphere.) Because of all 
these factors, the composition of the atmosphere is not uniform.
Table 18.1 shows the composition of dry air near sea level. Note that although traces 
of many substances are present, N2 and O2 make up about 99% of sea-level air. The noble 
gases and CO2 make up most of the remainder.
