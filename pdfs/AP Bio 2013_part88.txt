overed choice chamber is used to test whether the spatial 
distribution of flies is affected by the presence of a substance placed at one end of the chamber. To test 
the flies’ preference for glucose, 60 flies are introduced into the middle of the choice chamber at the 
insertion point indicated by the arrow in the figure above. A cotton ball soaked with a 10 percent 
glucose solution is placed at one end of the chamber, and a dry cotton ball with no solution is placed at 
the other end. The positions of flies are observed and recorded every minute for 10 minutes. 
(a) Predict the distribution of flies in the chamber after 10 minutes and justify your prediction. 
(2 points maximum)  
• 
1 point for predicting the location of the flies in the choice chamber 
• 
1 point for justifying the prediction 
(b) Propose ONE specific improvement to each of the following parts of the experimental design and 
explain how the modification will affect the experiment. (4 points maximum)
