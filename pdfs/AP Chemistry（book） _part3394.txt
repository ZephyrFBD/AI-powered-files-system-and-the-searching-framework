er than those associated with nonnuclear chemical reactions? The answer 
to this question begins with Einsteinâ€™s celebrated equation from the theory of relativity 
that relates mass and energy:
 
E = mc2 
[21.22]
In this equation E stands for energy, m for mass, and c for the speed of light, 
2.9979 * 108 m/s. This equation states that mass and energy are equivalent and can 
be converted into one another. If a system loses mass, it loses energy; if it gains mass, it 
gains energy. Because the proportionality constant between energy and mass, c2, is such 
a large number, even small changes in mass are accompanied by large changes in energy.
The mass changes in chemical reactions are too small to detect. For example, the 
mass change associated with the combustion of 1 mol of CH4 (an exothermic process) is 
-9.9 * 10-9 g. Because the mass change is so small, it is possible to treat chemical reac-
tions as though mass is conserved.
