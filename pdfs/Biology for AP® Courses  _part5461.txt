Cult corporations and their billionaires may have taken wealth
disparity to cataclysmic levels of injustice, but as long as they speak
the language of Woke, hand out the dosh to the Woke network and
censor the enemy they are ‘one of us’. Billionaires who don’t give a
damn about injustice are laughing at them till their bellies hurt.
Wokers are not even close to self-aware enough to see that. The
transformed ‘leĞ’ dynamic means that Wokers who drone on about
‘social justice’ are funded by billionaires that have destroyed social
justice the world over. It’s why they are billionaires.
The climate con
Nothing encapsulates what I have said more comprehensively than
the hoax of human-caused global warming. I have detailed in my
books over the years how Cult operatives and organisations were the
pump-primers from the start of the climate con. A purpose-built
vehicle for this is the Club of Rome established by the Cult in 1968
