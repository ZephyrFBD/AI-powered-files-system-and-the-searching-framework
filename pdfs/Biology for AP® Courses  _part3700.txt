pressures. Immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody
mediated immunity.

Blood Types Related to Proteins on the Surface of the Red Blood
Cells
Red blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The composition of these
molecules is determined by genetics, which have evolved over time. In humans, the different surface
antigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups with more than 100 different antigens on each red
blood cell. The two most well known blood groups are the ABO, shown in Figure 31.9, and Rh systems.
The surface antigens in the ABO blood group are glycolipids, called antigen A and antigen B. People with
blood type A have antigen A, those with blood type B have antigen B, those with blood type AB have both
antigens, and people with blood type O have neither an
