Give It Some Thought
Suppose you have a system made up of water only, with the container and 
everything beyond being the surroundings. Consider a process in which the water 
is first evaporated and then condensed back into its original container. Is this two-
step process necessarily reversible?
As an example, letâ€™s consider a process involving the transfer of heat. When two objects 
at different temperatures are in contact, heat flows spontaneously from the hotter object to 
the colder one. Because it is impossible to make the heat flow in the opposite direction, 
from colder to hotter, this is an irreversible process. Given this fact, can we imagine any 
hypothetical conditions under which the heat transfer could be reversible? The answer is 
yes, but only if we consider temperature changes that are infinitesimally small.
Imagine the system and its surroundings at essentially the same temperature, with 
just an infinitesimal temperature difference, dT, between them (Figure 19.3). I
