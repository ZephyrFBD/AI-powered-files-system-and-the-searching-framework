 added. Calculation 
of the electric field at points A and B 
for Examples 16–9 and 16–10.
SOLUTION
1. Draw a careful diagram. The directions of the electric fields 
and 
as
well as the net field 
are shown in Fig. 16–29.
points away from the
positive charge
points toward the negative charge 
2. Apply Coulomb’s law to find the magnitudes of the contributing electric
fields. Because B is equidistant from the two equal charges (40 cm by the
Pythagorean theorem), the magnitudes of 
and 
are the same; that is,
3. Add vectorially, and use symmetry when possible. The y components of 
and 
are equal and opposite. Because of this symmetry, the total 
field 
is horizontal and equals
