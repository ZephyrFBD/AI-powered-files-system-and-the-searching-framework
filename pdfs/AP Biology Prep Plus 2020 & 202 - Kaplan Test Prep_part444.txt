Thus, the diﬀerence in respiratory rate between the germinating and
non-germinating peas is 0.015 – 0.005, which equals 0.01. (A) is
correct.

The diagram shows hydrogen ions flowing through the ATP synthase,
down their concentration gradient, (C). Although sunlight and the
breakdown of glucose into carbon dioxide might provide energy to
create the hydrogen ion gradient, they are not shown in the diagram
and are not the immediate source of energy. Therefore, (A) and (B) are
incorrect. In a mitochondrion, the membrane folds around in three
dimensions. Thus, it would be equally correct to draw the diagram in
the opposite orientation so that the hydrogen ions appear to be
flowing up. Gravity has
