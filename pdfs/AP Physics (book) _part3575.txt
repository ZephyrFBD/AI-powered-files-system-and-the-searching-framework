by instruments. The photon is said to mediate, or carry, the electromagnetic
force.
By analogy with photon exchange that mediates the electromagnetic force,
Yukawa argued that there ought to be a particle that mediates the strong nuclear
force—the force that holds nucleons together in the nucleus. Yukawa called this
predicted particle a meson (meaning “medium mass”). Figure 32–9 is a Feynman
diagram showing the original model of meson exchange: a meson carrying the
strong force between a neutron and a proton.
A rough estimate of the mass of the meson can be made as follows. Suppose
the proton on the left in Fig. 32–9 is at rest. For it to emit a meson would require
energy (to make the meson’s mass) which, coming from nowhere, would violate
conservation of energy. But the uncertainty principle allows nonconservation 
of energy by an amount 
if it occurs only for a time 
given by
We set 
equal to the energy needed to create the mass m
of the meson:
Conservation of energy is violated onl
