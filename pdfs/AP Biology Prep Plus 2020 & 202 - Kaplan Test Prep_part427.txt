d then go through
the electron transport chain, where they would be used to
generate additional ATP.
(C)
If the individual were only undergoing aerobic respiration, 7
molecules of NADH and 2 molecule of FADH2, in addition to 2
molecules of ATP would be generated through glycolysis and
the Krebs cycle. The NADH and FADH2 would then go through
the electron transport chain, where they would be used to
generate additional ATP.

9. A student sets up an experiment to measure the rate of
photosynthesis by using a syringe to create a vacuum to remove
trapped air and infiltrate the interior of plant disk samples with a
solution containing bicarbonate ions that serve as a carbon
source for photosynthesis. The infiltrated leaves sink in the
bicarbonate solution, as shown below.
When placed in suﬀicient light, photosynthesis occurs, causing
the plant disks to rise. The student leaves the room aȇer 20
minutes, accidentally shutting oﬀ the light in the process. Which
of the following graphs most
