red from the universe—except for a slight excess of
electrons over positrons (later to join with nuclei to form atoms). Thus, about
after the Big Bang, the universe entered the radiation era (Fig. 33–29).
Its major constituents were photons and neutrinos. But the neutrinos, partaking
only in the weak force, rarely interacted. So the universe, until then experiencing
significant amounts of energy in matter and in radiation, now became 
radiation-dominated: much more energy was contained in radiation than in matter,
a situation that would last more than 50,000 years.
