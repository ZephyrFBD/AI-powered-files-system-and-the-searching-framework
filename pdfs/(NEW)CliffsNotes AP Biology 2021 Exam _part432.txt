proposed RNA world hypothesis argues the reverse. This is based upon recent discoveries of the many diverse
functions of RNA molecules. In particular, RNA molecules can act both as enzymes (ribozymes) and as vehicles of
information storage (genetic material). Thus, RNA can perform the functions of both proteins (enzymes) and DNA.
5. Organic molecules were concentrated and isolated into protobionts.
 
Protobionts were the precursors of cells. They were able to carry out chemical reactions enclosed within a border
across which materials could be exchanged. Borders formed in the same manner as hydrophobic molecules
aggregate to form membranes (as phospholipids form plasma membranes).
Liposomes and coacervates are experimentally (and abiotically) produced protobionts that have some selectively
permeable qualities. Both have borders that form when molecules with similar chemical properties (like hydrophilic
molecules, such as lipids) separate from other molecules with different chemica
