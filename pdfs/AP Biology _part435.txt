 of hundreds of breeds of dogs. All dogs
belong to one species, Canus familiaris.
While it would seem that natural selection would tend to reduce genetic
variation by removing unfavorable genotypes from a population, nature
has many mechanisms to preserve it. Here are eight mechanisms that
preserve diversity or variation in a gene pool or population: balanced
polymorphism, geographic variation, sexual reproduction, outbreeding,
diploidy, heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent selection, and
evolutionary neutral traits.

1. Balanced Polymorphism
Balanced polymorphism is the presence of two or more phenotypically
distinct forms of a trait in a single population of a species. The shells of
one genus of land snail exhibit a wide range of colors and banding
patterns. Banded snails living on dark, mottled ground are less visible than
unbanded ones and therefore are preyed upon less frequently. In areas
where the background is fairly unif
