sphate heads will be attracted to the surrounding water molecules. The hydrophobic
lipid tails will be repelled by the water and orient themselves in the center of the micelle. Thus, part A
represents the hydrophilic portions of the micelle, and part B represents the hydrophobic portions of the micelle.
Choice (B) is incorrect because the phosphate heads are hydrophilic, not hydrophobic, and the tails are
hydrophobic, not hydrophilic. Although choices (C) and (D) do refer to fats and associated fatty molecules that
may be found in a plasma membrane of a cell, that is not what is represented in this image. Thus, both (C) and
(D) are incorrect.
3. (B) This graph shows the means correctly plotted with 95% confidence intervals. The upper limit of the 95%
confidence interval is the mean plus 2 
, and the lower limit is the mean minus 2 
. Choice (A) is incorrect
because the upper and lower limits were calculated with only 1 
, not 2 
. Choice (C) is incorrect because
