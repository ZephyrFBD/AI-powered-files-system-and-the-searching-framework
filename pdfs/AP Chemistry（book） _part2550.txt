Strongly basic solutions are also created by certain substances that react with water 
to form OH-1aq2. The most common of these contain the oxide ion. Ionic metal oxides, 
especially Na2O and CaO, are often used in industry when a strong base is needed. The 
O2- reacts very exothermically with water to form OH -, leaving virtually no O2- in the 
solution:
 
O2-1aq2 + H2O1l2 ¡  2 OH -1aq2 
[16.22]
Thus, a solution formed by dissolving 0.010 mol of Na2O1s2 in enough water to form 1.0 
L of solution has 3OH-4 = 0.020 M and a pH of 12.30.
Give It Some Thought
The CH3
- ion is the conjugate base of CH4, and CH4 shows no evidence of being an 
acid in water. Write a balanced equation for the reaction of CH3
- and water.
16.6 ∣ Weak Acids
Most acidic substances are weak acids and therefore only partially ionized in aqueous 
solution (Figure 16.10). We can use the equilibrium constant for the ionization reaction 
to express the extent to which a weak acid ionizes. If we represent a gener
