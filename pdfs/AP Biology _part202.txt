The ETC is a collection of molecules embedded in the cristae
membrane of the mitochondrion.
There are thousands of copies of the ETC in every mitochondrion
due to the extensive folding of the cristae membrane.
The ETC carries electrons delivered by NADH and FADH2 from
glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to oxygen, the final electron
acceptor, through a series of redox reactions. In a redox reaction,
one atom gains electrons or hydrogen (reduction), and one atom
loses electrons or hydrogen (oxidation).
The highly electronegative oxygen pulls electrons through the
electron transport chain. Electrons lose PE as they “fall down” the
ETC toward oxygen.
NADH delivers its electrons to a higher energy level in the chain
than does FADH2. As a
