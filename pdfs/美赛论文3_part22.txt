nd move in all directions
partly. Accordingly, the move of the water in the bathtub can be dealt as “the
model of a river”.
(2) Heat conduction: Heat of the hot water will spread into the other part of the water
in the bathtub, accompanied by the flow and diffusion of water naturally, leading
to the water exchange. According to assumptions above, the height of hot water
column almost occupies the whole water column. Therefore, we can assume that
temperature of the same vertical line is the same, so the flow and the heat
conduction of water which is actually three-dimensional can be seen as that of
water on a plane.
2.2.6 The model of draining away the warm water
As a result, the whole process is that the continuous hot water column enters into
the flowing water, realizing the flow and the conduction of water. At the same time,
the same volume of cold water will run out of the bathtub through the overflow drain.
Consequently, the total process can be regarded as “the model of draining a
