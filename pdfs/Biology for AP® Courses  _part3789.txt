aqueous solutions) and the charge on the ions.
Thus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two
(like calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is
the milliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually
maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.
Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers
Persons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt
to drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only
a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either
freshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible,
