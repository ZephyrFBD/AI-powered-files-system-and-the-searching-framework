 small lake. If the rock (SG
, Table 10–1)
is thrown overboard and sinks, does the lake level drop, rise, or stay the same?
RESPONSE Together the boat and rock float, so the buoyant force on them
equals their total weight. The boat and rock displace a mass of water whose
weight is equal to the weight of boat plus rock. When the rock is thrown into the
lake, it displaces only its own volume, which is smaller than the volume of water
the rock displaced when in the boat (
as much because the rock’s density is
times greater than water). So less lake water is displaced and the water level
of the lake drops when the rock is in the lake.
Maybe numbers can help. Suppose the boat and the rock each has a mass of
60 kg. Then the boat carrying the rock displaces 120 kg of water, which is a volume
of 0.12 m3 (
for water, Table 10–1). When the rock is thrown 
into the lake, the boat alone now displaces 0.06 m3. The rock displaces only its
own volume of 0.02 m3 (
so 
). Thus a total of 0.08 m3
