tron carrier (NAD+) is shown on the left and the reduced form (NADH) is shown
on the right. The nitrogenous base in NADH has one more hydrogen ion and two more electrons than in NAD+.

ATP in Living Systems
A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the
cell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able
to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells
accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the “energy currency” of the cell,
and, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a
rechargeable battery.
When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The en
