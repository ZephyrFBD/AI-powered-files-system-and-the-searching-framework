ow attached to the end of the
spring, and the mass is allowed to fall, where will the end
of the spring line up with the ruler marks when the mass is
at its lowest position?
36. (II) A 0.48-kg ball is thrown with a speed of 
at an
upward angle of 36°. (a) What is its speed at its highest point,
and (b) how high does it go? (Use conservation of energy.)
37. (II) A 1200-kg car moving on a horizontal surface has speed
when it strikes a horizontal coiled spring and
is brought to rest in a distance of 2.2 m. What is the spring
stiffness constant of the spring?

upward from the top of a platform 
with a vertical speed of 
(a) How fast is he going as he lands on
the trampoline, 2.0 m below (Fig.6–40)?
(b) If the trampoline behaves
like a spring of spring con-
