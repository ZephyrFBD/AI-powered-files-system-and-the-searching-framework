, and/or when
near their liquefaction point, deviates from the ideal gas law
due to the attractive forces between molecules. Below the
critical temperature, a gas can change to a liquid if sufficient
pressure is applied; but if the temperature is higher than the
critical temperature, no amount of pressure will cause a liquid
surface to form. The triple point of a substance is that unique
temperature and pressure at which all three phases—solid,
liquid, and gas—can coexist in equilibrium.
Evaporation of a liquid is the result of the fastest moving
molecules escaping from the surface. Saturated vapor pressure
refers to the pressure of the vapor above a liquid when the two
phases are in equilibrium. The vapor pressure of a substance
(such as water) depends strongly on temperature, and at the
boiling point is equal to atmospheric pressure. Relative humidity
of air is the ratio of the actual partial pressure of water vapor in
the air to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature; it i
