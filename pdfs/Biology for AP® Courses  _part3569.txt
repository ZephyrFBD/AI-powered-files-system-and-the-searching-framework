ust be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.
Organisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration
than in the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much smaller
than that. Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (Figure
30.4). Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved
oxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated

blood to the other parts of the body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill
surfaces into the coelomic fluid. Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.
