CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
indicate any one of the halogen elements.) Fluorine and chlorine are more reactive than 
bromine and iodine. In fact, fluorine removes electrons from almost any substance with 
which it comes into contact, including water, and usually does so very exothermically, as 
in the following examples:
 
2 H2O1l2 + 2 F21g2 ¡ 4 HF1aq2 + O21g2  ∆H = -758.9 kJ 
[7.31]
 
    SiO21s2 + 2 F21g2 ¡ SiF41g2 + O21g2  ∆H = -704.0 kJ 
[7.32]
As a result, fluorine gas is difficult and dangerous to use in the laboratory, requiring spe-
cialized equipment.
Chlorine is the most industrially useful of the halogens. It is produced by a process 
called electrolysis, where an electrical current is used to oxidize chloride anions to molec-
ular chlorine, Cl2. Unlike fluorine, chlorine reacts slowly with water to form relatively 
stable aqueous solutions of HCl and HOCl (hypochlorous acid):
 
Cl21g2 + H2O1l2 ¡ HCl1aq2 + HOCl1aq2 
[7.33]
Chlorine is often added to
