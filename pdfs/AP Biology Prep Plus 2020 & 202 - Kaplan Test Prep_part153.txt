 the
membrane do not change.
Facilitated diﬀusion, another type of passive transport, involves the use
of channel or carrier proteins embedded in the membrane to allow
impermeable molecules to diﬀuse down a gradient. The structures of the
proteins involved in this type of transport are very similar, and amino
acid sequences are highly conserved across many species. In some cases,
these proteins act as pores for ions; in other cases, they may open and
close in response to external signals. Keep in mind that, because cells
naturally have a negatively charged cytoplasm, the opening of ion
channels favors the movement of positively charged ions into the
Tonicity and Osmosis
cytoplasm. The combination of diﬀerential solute concentrations and an
electrical gradient is called an electrochemical gradient and is the key
determinant of what moves into and out of membranes when passive
transport channels are open.
In active transport, membrane proteins use the energy of ATP to change
