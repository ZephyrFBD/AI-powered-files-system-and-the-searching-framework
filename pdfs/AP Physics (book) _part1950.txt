Luigi Galvani (1737–1798), professor at the University of Bologna,
carried out a series of experiments on the contraction of a frog’s leg muscle by using
static electricity. Galvani found that the muscle also contracted when dissimilar
metals were inserted into the frog. Galvani believed that the source of the electric
charge was in the frog muscle or nerve itself, and that the metal merely transmitted
the charge to the proper points. When he published his work in 1791, he termed
this charge “animal electricity.” Many wondered, including Galvani himself, if he
had discovered the long-sought “life-force.”
Volta, at the University of Pavia 200 km away, was skeptical of Galvani’s
results, and came to believe that the source of the electricity was not in the animal
itself, but rather in the contact between the dissimilar metals. Volta realized that 
a moist conductor, such as a frog muscle or moisture at the contact point of two
dissimilar metals, was necessary in the circuit if it was to
