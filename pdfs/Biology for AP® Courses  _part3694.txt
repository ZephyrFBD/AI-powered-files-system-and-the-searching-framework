nd O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days,
at which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood
cell.
White Blood Cells
White blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in
blood. The role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune
response to identify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. White blood cells
are formed continually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.
The morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. They have nuclei and do not contain
hemoglobin. The different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining,
and each has a different specialized function. The two main groups, both illustrated in Figure 3
