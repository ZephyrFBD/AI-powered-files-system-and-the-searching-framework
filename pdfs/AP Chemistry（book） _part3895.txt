ble-helix 
structure, therefore, each thymine on one strand is opposite an ade-
nine on the other strand, and each cytosine is opposite a guanine. The 
double-helix structure with complementary bases on the two strands is 
the key to understanding how DNA functions.
The two strands of DNA unwind during cell division, and new 
complementary strands are constructed on the unraveling strands

nucleotide is deoxyribose, this polynucleotide is DNA.
The five-carbon sugar in RNA is ribose, and that in DNA is deoxyribose:
