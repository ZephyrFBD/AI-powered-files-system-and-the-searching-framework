and consider how endocrine glands and their hormone products work together and with the nervous system to communicate
and regulate the bodyâ€™s physiology to maintain homeostasis. For example, the hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the
endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is located in the brain and receives input from the body and other brain
areas and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes. The pituitary gland is attached to the hypothalamus and
receives products from the hypothalamus, causing, in turn, the secretion of anterior and posterior pituitary hormones such
as growth hormone (GH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and oxytocin. The thyroid gland,
located in the neck just below the larynx, releases T3 and T4 in response to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) produced
by the anterior pituitary. Another example is how frog development is disrupted by estrogen in waste water, which you can
