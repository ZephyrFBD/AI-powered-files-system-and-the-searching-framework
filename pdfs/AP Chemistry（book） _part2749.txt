olubility of a substance is the quantity that dissolves to form a saturated 
solution. 
 (Section 13.2) Solubility is often expressed as grams of solute per liter of 
solution 1g>L2. Molar solubility is the number of moles of solute that dissolve in form-
ing 1 L of saturated solution of the solute 1mol>L2. The solubility-product constant 1Ksp2 
is the equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between an ionic solid and its saturated 
solution and is a unitless number. Thus, the magnitude of Ksp is a measure of how much 
of the solid dissolves to form a saturated solution.
Give It Some Thought
Without doing a calculation, predict which of these compounds has the greatest 
molar solubility in water: AgCl 1Ksp = 1.8 * 10-102, AgBr 1Ksp = 5.0 * 10-132, or 
AgI 1Ksp = 8.3 * 10-172.
