you choose to evaluate their research project. Give them an opportunity to modify their 
posters before you evaluate the work with the same rubrics. 
Miniposters have an advantage over traditional posters by not requiring quite so 
much time. If the students are working in research teams, you might consider emulating 
a professional society’s poster session. When students put in this amount of work, it is 
appropriate to display their work publicly. Displaying posters in the science hall is an 
excellent way to provide a sense of authenticity to the research. 
■ Where Can Students Go from Here? 
An essential component of this investigation is to take it beyond the simple selection 
experiment. With the skills and knowledge gained in the selection experiment, students 
should be able to design new experiments to investigate the adaptive characteristics 
of the trait they studied — particularly if they selected for a quantitative trait like 
trichomes.
