rom predators.. In addition to a laboratory study, he tested
this using a field experiment involving four areas. Area 1 had no guppies while area 2 had guppies but no
predators. Area 3 had guppies and a predator (Crenicichla alta). Endler introduced guppies from area 3
(which were drab because of predation) to area 1 (which had no guppies). The guppies that were relocated
to area 1 developed brighter colors over 2 years (enough for several guppy generations) and eventually
resembled the guppies in area 2. Make a diagram showing each of the locations, all of the fish species
present at the start, and the fish present at the end. Label the fish as “more conspicuous colors” or “less
conspicuous colors.”
Think About It
Describe how this experiment shows that there is genetic variability in the original population. How do you know that
there was genetic variability in the fish taken from area 1? Explain the tradeoff between bright colors that are attractive
to female guppies and the risk of
