t a high potential compared to 
point d at the negative side of the battery. That is, point e is like the top of a hill
for a roller coaster. We follow the current around the circuit starting at any point.
We choose to start at point d and follow a small positive test charge completely
around this circuit. As we go, we note all changes in potential. When the test
charge returns to point d, the potential will be the same as when we started (total
change in potential around the circuit is zero). We plot the changes in potential
around the circuit in Fig. 19â€“12b; point d is arbitrarily taken as zero.
As our positive test charge goes from point d, which is the negative or low
potential side of the battery, to point e, which is the positive terminal (high poten-
tial side) of the battery, the potential increases by 12.0 V. (This is like the roller
coaster being pulled up the first hill.) That is,
When our test charge moves from point e to point a, there is no change in potential
because the
