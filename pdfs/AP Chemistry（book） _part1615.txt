ore frequently. (d) The number 
of collisions with a unit area of wall per unit time increases because 
the total number of collisions with the walls per unit time in-
creases and the area of the walls decreases. (e) Although the aver-
age force with which the molecules collide with the walls remains 
constant, the pressure increases because there are more collisions 
per unit area of wall per unit time.
Check In a conceptual exercise of this kind, there is no numerical 
answer to check. All we can check in such cases is our reasoning in 
the course of solving the problem. The increase in pressure seen in 
part (e) is consistent with Boyle’s law.

Consider two gas cylinders of the same volume and tempera-
ture, one containing 1.0 mol of propane, C3H8, and the other 
2.0 mol of methane, CH4. Which of the following statements 
is true? (a) The C3H8 and CH4 molecules have the same urms 
(b) The C3H8 and CH4 molecules have the same average ki-
