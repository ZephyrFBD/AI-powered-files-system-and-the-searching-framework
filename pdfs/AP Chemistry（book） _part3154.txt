nsumed as it is 
generated, but for many applications, stored 
electrical energy is needed. In such cases 
electrical energy is converted into chemical 
energy, which can be stored and is portable, and 
then converted back to electricity when needed.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY
◀ THE TESLA GIGAFACTORY, under construction in Nevada, will be 
the largest lithium-ion battery production facility in the world once 
completed in 2017. These batteries will be used in a wide variety of 
applications, including Tesla’s all-electric vehicles.
 20.1 ▶  Oxidation States and Oxidation–
Reduction Reactions Review 
oxidation states and oxidation–reduction 
(redox) reactions.
 20.2 ▶  Balancing Redox Equations Learn 
how to balance redox equations using the 
method of half-reactions.
 20.3 ▶  Voltaic Cells Consider voltaic cells, 
which produce electricity from spontaneous 
redox reactions. Solid electrodes serve 
as the surfaces at which oxidation and 
reduction take place. The electrode where 
oxidation occurs
