12.26) if carbon atoms replace both the zinc and sulfide ions. The carbon atoms 
are sp3@hybridized and held together by strong carbon– 
carbon single covalent bonds. 
The strength and directionality of these bonds make diamond the hardest known mate-
rial. For this reason, industrial-grade diamonds are employed in saw blades used for the 
most demanding cutting jobs. The stiff, interconnected bond network also explains why 
diamond is one of the best-known thermal conductors, yet is not electrically conductive. 
Diamond has a high melting point, 3550 °C.
In graphite, [Figure 12.29(b)], the carbon atoms form covalently bonded layers that 
are held together by intermolecular forces. The layers in graphite are the same as those 
in the graphene sheet shown in Figure 12.8. Graphite has a hexagonal unit cell contain-
ing two layers offset so that the carbon atoms in a given layer sit over the middle of the 
hexagons of the layer below. Each carbon is covalently bonded to three other carbon
