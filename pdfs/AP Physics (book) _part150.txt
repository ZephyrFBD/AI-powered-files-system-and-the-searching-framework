Average acceleration. A car accelerates on a straight road from
rest to 
in 5.0 s, Fig.2–10. What is the magnitude of its average acceleration?
APPROACH Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the elapsed
time, 5.0 s. The car starts from rest, so 
The final velocity is 
.
SOLUTION From Eq. 2–4, the average acceleration is
This is read as “fifteen kilometers per hour per second” and means that, on
average, the velocity changed by 15 km h during each second. That is, assuming
the acceleration was constant, during the first second the car’s velocity increased
from zero to 15 km h. During the next second its velocity increased by another
15 km h, reaching a velocity of 30 km h at
and so on. See Fig. 2–10.
