reaction 2 Al1s2 + 3 Cl21g2 ยก 2 AlCl31s2, which is the 
 
limiting reactant? (b) How many moles of AlCl3 are formed? 
(c) How many moles of the excess reactant remain at the end 
of the reaction?
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to calculate the number of moles of product, 
NH3, given the quantities of each reactant, N2 and H2, available in 
a reaction. This is a limiting reactant problem.
Plan If we assume one reactant is completely consumed, we can cal-
culate how much of the second reactant is needed. By comparing the 
calculated quantity of the second reactant with the amount avail-
able, we can determine which reactant is limiting. We then proceed 
with the calculation, using the quantity of the limiting reactant.
Solve
The number of moles of H2 needed for complete consumption of 
3.0 mol of N2 is
Moles H2 = 13.0 mol N22a 3 mol H2
1 mol N2
b = 9.0 mol H2
Because only 6.0 mol H2 is available, we will run out of H2 before the 
N2 is gone, which tells us that H2 is the limiting rea
