15.4 ∣ Heterogeneous Equilibria
Many equilibria involve substances that are all in the same phase. Such equilibria are 
called homogeneous equilibria. The equilibrium between N2O41g2 and NO21g2
shown in Figure 15.2 is one such example. In some cases, however, the substances in 
equilibrium are in different phases, giving rise to heterogeneous equilibria. An 
example occurs when solid lead(II) chloride dissolves in water to form a saturated 
solution:
 
PbCl21s2 ∆ Pb2+1aq2 + 2 Cl-1aq2 
[15.19]
This system consists of a solid in equilibrium with two aqueous species. If we want to 
write the equilibrium-constant expression for this process, we encounter a problem we 
have not encountered
