aph, as was done in Figure 
A.18, we have what is called a “family” of curves. If we look at the slopes of the various 
members of the family of curves for Process I, we see that the steepest slope does not 
correspond to the highest temperature. In fact, the curve for 30° is the steepest, whereas 
the curve for 50° is the least steep; the curve for 10°, the lowest temperature, has an 
intermediate slope. By analyzing and comparing the slopes of the family of curves in 
this way we can get a reasonably good notion of the effect of temperature on Process I, 
but this effect could be shown much more clearly in a rate graph that has temperature 
as the abscissa. Such a graph would show us at a glance how the rate varies with 
temperature and, of course, would be preferable, as the whole point in making a graph is 
to present information simply and clearly. The diagram in Figure A.20 shows how a rate-
temperature graph would be constructed from this family of curves for Process I.
