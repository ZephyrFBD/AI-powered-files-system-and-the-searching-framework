ncountered in math class because the math teacher
always provided you with values to graph that formed a perfectly straight
line. In science, when you collect data, the numbers rarely fall into a
straight line. However, if the line is not straight, you cannot make
predictions by simply extending the line. Somehow, you must translate
your rough data into a straight line. Here is how.
STUDY TIP
Can you draw a line of best fit? Learn how.
Plot your points as usual. Then, draw a straight line that best shows the
trend (slope) and that takes into account the location of all the data points.
If one data point really differs from all the others, you may ignore it. Also,
when drawing a line of best fit, your line does not have to pass through any
data points and it does not have to pass through zero. Figure 19.1 shows a
scatter plot graph with data points plotted and a line of best fit drawn.
