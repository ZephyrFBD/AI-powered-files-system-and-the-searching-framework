18. Epinephrine is a protein hormone found in many 
animals. Epinephrine stimulates a signaling 
pathway that results in the breakdown of glycogen 
to glucose in the liver cells. Which of the 
following describes the initial steps in the process 
whereby epinephrine stimulates glycogen 
breakdown? 
(A) Epinephrine binds to a cell-surface receptor; 
the activated receptor stimulates production 
of the second messenger, cAMP. 
(B) Epine
