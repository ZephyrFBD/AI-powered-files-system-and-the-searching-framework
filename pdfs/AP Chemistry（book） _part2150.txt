f H2O and C2H5OH. (a) What is the mole 
fraction of ethanol in the solution? (b) Assuming ideal- 
solution behavior, what is the vapor pressure of the solu-
tion at 63.5 °C? (c) What is the mole fraction of ethanol in 
the vapor above the solution?
 
[13.68] At 20 °C, the vapor pressure of benzene 1C6H62 is 75 torr, 
and that of toluene 1C7H82 is 22 torr. Assume that ben-
zene and toluene form an ideal solution. (a) What is the 
composition in mole fraction of a solution that has a va-
por pressure of 35 torr at 20 °C? (b) What is the mole frac-
tion of benzene in the vapor above the solution described 
in part (a)?
 13.69  (a) Does a 0.10 m aqueous solution of NaCl have a higher 
boiling point, a lower boiling point, or the same boiling 
point as a 0.10 m aqueous solution of C6H12O6? (b) The ex-
perimental boiling point of the NaCl solution is lower than 
that calculated assuming that NaCl is completely dissoci-
ated in solution. Why is this the case?
