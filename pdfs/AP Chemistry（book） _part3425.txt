Fusion is appealing as an energy source because of the availability of light isotopes 
on Earth and because fusion products are generally not radioactive. Despite this fact, 
fusion is not presently used to generate energy. The problem is that extremely high 
temperatures and pressures are needed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between 
nuclei in order to fuse them. The lowest temperature required for any fusion is about 
40,000,000 K, the temperature needed to fuse deuterium and tritium:

Fusion reactions are therefore also known as thermonuclear reactions.
Such high temperatures have been achieved by using an atomic bomb to initiate 
fusion. This is the operating principle behind a thermonuclear, or hydrogen, bomb. This 
approach is obviously unacceptable, however, for a power generation plant.*
Numerous problems must be overcome before fusion becomes a practical energy
