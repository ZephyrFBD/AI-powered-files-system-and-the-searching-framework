occurs because water molecules are attracted to charges on the inner surfaces of narrow tubular
structures such as glass tubes, drawing the water molecules to the sides of the tubes
positive ion that is formed by an atom losing one or more electrons
interaction between two or more of the same or different atoms that results in the formation of molecules
process leading to the rearrangement of atoms in molecules
the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other
intermolecular forces between water molecules caused by the polar nature of water; responsible for surface
tension
substance composed of molecules consisting of atoms of at least two different elements
type of strong bond formed between two atoms of the same or different elements; forms when electrons
are shared between atoms
release of an ion from a molecule such that the original molecule now consists of an ion and the charged
remains of the original, such as when water dissociates into H+ and
