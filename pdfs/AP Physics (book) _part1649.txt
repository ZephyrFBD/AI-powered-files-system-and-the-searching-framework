ice/water.
APPROACH We consider the 56 g of water, initially in the form of ice, as our
system. To determine the entropy change, we first must find the heat needed to
melt the ice, which we do using the latent heat of fusion of water,
(Section 14–5). The heat Q required comes from the surroundings.
SOLUTION The heat required to melt 28 g of ice (half of the 56-g ice cube) is
The temperature remains constant in our process, so we can find the change in
entropy from Eq. 15–8:
NOTE The change in entropy of the surroundings (cup, air) has not been computed.

EXAMPLE 15;13
Entropy change when water samples are
mixed. A sample of 50.0 kg of water at 20.00°C is mixed with 50.0 kg of water
at 24.00°C. Estimate the change in entropy.
APPROACH The final temperature of the mixture will be 22.00°C, since we
started with equal amounts of water. We use the specific heat of water and 
the methods of calorimetry (S
