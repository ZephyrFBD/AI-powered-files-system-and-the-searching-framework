de any number of interacting
objects. To show this, we let in Eq.7–2
represent the total momen-
tum of a system—that is, the vector sum of the momenta of all objects in the system.
(For our two-object system above,
) If the net force 
on the
system is zero [as it was above for our two-object system,
], then
from Eq. 7–2,
so the total momentum doesn’t change. The
general statement of the law of conservation of momentum is
The total momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.
By a system, we simply mean a set of objects that we choose, and which may
interact with each other. An isolated system is one in which the only (significant)
forces are those between the objects in the system. The sum of all these “internal”
forces within the system will be zero because of Newton’s third law. If there are
external forces—by which we mean forces exerted by objects outside the system—
and they don’t add up to zero, then the total momentum of the system won’t be
conserved. However, if
