for “inner chamber”), illustrated in Figure 26.24, acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives
sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate
conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus
helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. A rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the
degeneration of thalamic neurons and glia. This disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other
symptoms, and is eventually fatal.
