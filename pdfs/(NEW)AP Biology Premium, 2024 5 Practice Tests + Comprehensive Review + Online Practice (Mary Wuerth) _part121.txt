undings, and catalyzing chemical reactions. Glycoproteins and glycolipids function in
cell recognition. Steroids in the plasma membrane can adjust membrane fluidity in response to changing
environmental conditions and the needs of the cell. Individual phospholipids may also move across the surface of
the plasma membrane. Because the components of the plasma membrane have mobility, the structure of the
membrane is often referred to as a fluid mosaic model. (See Figure 5.13.)

What Can (and Cannot) Cross the Plasma Membrane
The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane gives it selective permeability. The hydrophobic lipids of the
phospholipids are much larger than the hydrophilic phosphates. Small hydrophobic molecules, such as oxygen (O2),
carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen (N2), can easily pass between the phospholipids into and out of the cell.
However, large polar molecules and ions cannot cross the cell membrane unassisted. These l
