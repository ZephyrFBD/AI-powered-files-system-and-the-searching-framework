factors can be limited by the person,
so the wasting water is almost not disturbed by the volume of the person.
(4)Conclusion:
People’s volume will have some impacts on our strategies before to some extent.
Modification is to increase the temperature of adding water moderately, increase
the speed of adding water and decrease the time of draining away water.
5.5 The temperature of the person
(1)Even time：
Different people have different body temperature. Even the same person has
different body temperature at different times. There is a difference if different people
have a bath. For example, people with high body temperature will speed up the
increase of the temperature of the water in the bathtub so as to decrease the time it
takes to reach the even temperature, which is just the even time.
(2)Suffering degree:
When the person with high body temperature has a bath, it will shorten the even
time a little bit and extend the time of process of cooling a little bit. From this
perspective,
