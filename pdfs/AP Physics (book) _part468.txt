FIGURE 5;4 A force is required to
keep an object moving in a circle. If
the speed is constant, the force is
directed toward the circle’s center.
There is a common misconception that an object moving in a circle has an 
outward force acting on it, a so-called centrifugal (“center-fleeing”) force. This is
incorrect: there is no outward force on the revolving object. Consider, for example,
a person swinging a ball on the end of a string around her head (Fig. 5–5). If you

your hand. The misconception arises when this pull is interpreted as an outward
“centrifugal” force pulling on the ball that is transmitted along the string to your
hand. This is not what is happening at all. To keep the ball moving in a circle, you
pull inwardly on the string, and the string exe
