that TBEwest(Hypr) is no longer in circulation, but it seems to have
evolved in two directions: TBEwest1 and TBEwest2. Using the empty tree below, correctly indicate
TBEwest(neu), TBEwest(Kuml), TBEwest1, and TBEwest2.
(d) This phylogenetic tree was created using nucleotide sequences. If protein sequences were used instead,
explain why this might increase the similarity between the viruses?
6. In a city in Australia there is a population of moths that live in the grass, rarely taking flight except for short
journeys. There are two phenotypes for wing color: green and beige. The largest predator of moths are birds
and bats that prey upon the moths as they rest upon blades of grass. Green moths fare better in wet conditions

dry brown color.
(a) Identify which color moth was the most plentiful between 1969 and 1995?
(b) Explain why the lines of the graph never exceed 100?
(c) Pr
