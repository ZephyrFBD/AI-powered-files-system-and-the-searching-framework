ns, such as the Lincoln-Peterson estimator3 of population size. Encourage 
students to develop and justify their own sampling procedures. Explore the strengths 
and shortcomings of various sampling strategies and techniques in order to instill in 
your students an understanding of the reasoning that goes into such decisions. 
One of the fundamental quantitative expectations of biology teachers is to help their 
students gain an appreciation for dimensions and the appropriate units of measurement. 
Too often, students have learned mathematical skills without the context of units. It 
is doubtful that you can overemphasize the importance of keeping track of units of 
measurement. It is only through extensive practice with, and attention to, units in 
calculations that a student begins to develop an intuitive understanding of scale between 
various levels of biology. For example, the calculations in Investigation 10: Energy 
Dynamics are relatively simple, but making sure that the units o
