(a) What is the mean, median, and mode for each dataset?
(b) The standard error of group A is 0.735, and the standard error for group B is 0.400. What does this tell you
about the data?
(c) What assumptions are made about the data in performing these tests?
(d) What could the researcher do to increase her confidence in the results?
Solutions:
(a) The means are
Remember, the median is the middle number, so itâ€™s best to put the data in order first.

The median of group A is 8, and the median of group B is 4.
The mode is the most frequent value. For group A, this is 8. For group B, the mode is 4.
(b) Standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. The sample size is five
for both group A and group B because five pictures were
