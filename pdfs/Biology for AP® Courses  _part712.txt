A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special molecules that catalyze biochemical
reactions are called enzymes. Almost all enzymes are proteins, made up of chains of amino acids, and they perform the
critical task of lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell. Enzymes do this by binding to the
reactant molecules, and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes
take place more readily. It is important to remember that enzymes don’t change the ∆G of a reaction. In other words, they
don’t change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they don’t change the free energy
of the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required to reach the transition state (Figure 6.15).
