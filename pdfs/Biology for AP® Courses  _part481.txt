 most abundant protein is collagen. Collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate-containing protein molecules
called proteoglycans. Collectively, these materials are called the extracellular matrix (Figure 4.27). Not only does the
extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with
each other. How can this happen?
Figure 4.27 The extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins and carbohydrates.
Cells have protein receptors on the extracellular surfaces of their plasma membranes. When a molecule within the matrix
binds to the receptor, it changes the molecular structure of the receptor. The receptor, in turn, changes the conformation
of the microfilaments positioned just inside the plasma membrane. These conformational changes induce chemical signals
inside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn “on” or “off” the transcription of specific sections of DNA, which affects the
production of associate
