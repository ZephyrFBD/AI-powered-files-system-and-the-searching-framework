PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria are producers. The earliest photosynthesis was conducted by prokaryotic
cyanobacteria, and later eukaryotes developed photosynthetic abilities. All they do is bask in the Sun, churning out
the glucose necessary for life. In this section, we’ll focus on how plants conduct photosynthesis.
Algae are a diverse group of aquatic, eukaryotic organisms that can perform
photosynthesis. Most algae are protists. Some common examples are
seaweed (such as kelp or phytoplankton), pond scum, or algal blooms in
lakes.
As we discussed earlier, photosynthesis is the process by which light energy is converted to chemical energy. Here’s
an overview of photosynthesis.
6CO2 + 6H2O 
 C6H12O6 + 6O2
You’ll notice from this equation that carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials used to manufacture simple
sugars. You’ll also see that oxygen is one of the products of photosynthesis. One important concept to know for the
AP Exam is that there is strong ev
