all distances between nerve cells, which
are called chemical synapses (Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this
enables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove!
When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the
target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical
synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly
and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.

Figure 9.3 The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell—called the synaptic gap—is very
small and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitter. Enzymes in the synapatic cleft degrade som
