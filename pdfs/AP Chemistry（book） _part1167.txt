ETALS (SECTION 7.8) Hydrogen 
is a nonmetal with properties that are distinct from any of the groups 
of the periodic table. It forms molecular compounds with other non-
metals, such as oxygen and the halogens.
Oxygen and sulfur are the most important elements in group 6A. 
Oxygen is usually found as a diatomic molecule, O2. Ozone, O3, is an 
important allotrope of oxygen. Oxygen has a strong tendency to gain 
electrons from other elements, thus oxidizing them. In combination 
with metals, oxygen is usually found as the oxide ion, O2 -, although 
salts of the peroxide ion, O2
2 -, and superoxide ion, O2
-, are sometimes 
formed. Elemental sulfur is most commonly found as S8 molecules. In 
combination with metals, it is most often found as the sulfide ion, S2 -.
The halogens (group 7A) exist as diatomic molecules. The halo-
gens have the most negative electron affinities of the elements. Thus, 
their chemistry is dominated by a tendency to form 1- ions, espe-
cially in reactions with me
