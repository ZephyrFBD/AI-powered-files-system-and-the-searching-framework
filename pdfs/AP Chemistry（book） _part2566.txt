CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
Reaction proceeds more rapidly 
in strong acid, leading to 
formation of larger H2 bubbles 
and rapid disappearance of 
metal.
Reaction eventually 
goes to completion in 
both acids.
H2 bubbles show 
reaction still in 
progress in weak acid.
1 M HCl(aq)
[H+] = 1 M
1 M CH3COOH(aq)
[H+] = 0.004 M
Reaction is 
complete in 
strong acid.
▲ Figure 16.11 The same reaction has different rates in a weak acid solution compared to a strong  
acid solution. The bubbles are H2 gas, which along with metal cations, is produced when a metal  
is oxidized by an acid.

Acid concentration (M)
Percent ionized
As concentration increases, a    
smaller percentage of CH3COOH 
molecules dissociates.
