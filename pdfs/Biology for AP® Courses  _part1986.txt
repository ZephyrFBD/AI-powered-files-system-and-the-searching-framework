homologous and which are analogous, and see examples of evolutionary adaptations to illustrate these concepts.
What is the basic difference between things that are homologous and things that are analogous?
a.
Things that are analogous look similar and things that are homologous do not.
b.
Things that are analogous have the same function and things that are homologous have different functions.
c.
Things that are analogous are not a result of evolution, whereas things that are homologous are.
d.
Things that are analogous result from convergence and things that are homologous result from common
ancestry
Another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. For example,
species of unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan,
