n thought and perception. The article said that
earlier studies revealed how nerve cell proteins ‘activated by heat
and mechanical pressure can be genetically engineered so that they
become sensitive to radio waves and magnetic ﬁelds, by aĴaching
them to an iron-storing protein called ferritin, or to inorganic
paramagnetic particles’. Sensitive to radio waves and magnetic
ﬁelds? You mean like 5G, 6G and 7G? This is the human-AI Smart
Grid hive mind we are talking about. The Guardian article said:
… the researchers injected Magneto into the striatum of freely behaving mice, a deep brain
structure containing dopamine-producing neurons that are involved in reward and motivation,
and then placed the animals into an apparatus split into magnetised and non-magnetised
sections.
Mice expressing Magneto spent far more time in the magnetised areas than mice that did not,
because activation of the protein caused the striatal neurons expressing it to release
dopamine, so that the mice found being
