ion 
occurs rapidly after a long period of stasis. 
Gradualism is when evolution occurs slowly 
over hundreds of thousands or millions 
of years.
EVO-3.E.2
Divergent evolution occurs when adaptation 
to new habitats results in phenotypic 
diversification. Speciation rates can be 
especially rapid during times of adaptive 
radiation as new habitats become available.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-3.F.1
Speciation results in diversity of life forms.
EVO-3.F.2
Speciation may be sympatric or allopatric.
EVO-3.F.3
Various prezygotic and postzygotic 
mechanisms can maintain reproductive 
isolation and prevent gene flow 
between populations.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
EVO-3.F
Explain the processes and 
mechanisms that drive 
speciation.
