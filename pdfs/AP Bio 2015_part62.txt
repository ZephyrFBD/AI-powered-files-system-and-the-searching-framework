 neural pathways among the structures represented in the figure above. One important stimulus 
in the control 
 of breathing is an increase in blood CO2 concentration, which is detected as a decrease in blood 
pH. Which of the following best describes the physiological response to an overall increase in cellular  
respiration in the body?  
(A) In response to depleted blood CO2 levels, the pH sensors send signals directly to the rib muscles, resulting 
in an increase in the rate of CO2 uptake by the lungs and a decrease in CO2 utilization by the brain. 
(B) In response to low blood pH, the pH sensors send a signal to the brain, which then sends a signal to the 
diaphragm, resulting in an increased rate of breathing to help eliminate excess blood CO2. 
(C) In response to high blood pH, the pH sensors send a signal directly to the lungs, resulting in a slower rate of 
breathing, and the lungs send a signal back to the heart once CO2 availability has been restored. 
(D) In response to an
