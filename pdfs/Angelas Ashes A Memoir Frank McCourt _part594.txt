y to the 
 
 Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have 
 
 two pieces of Cleeves’ toffee. It’s hard to see the screen with the yellow 
 
 stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what’s happening. 
 
 People around us tell him shut up, they’d like to hear what Boris 
 
 265 
 
 Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them 
 
 he’s only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank 
 
 Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he’ll throw 
 
 the two of us out. 
 
 I don’t mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and 
 
 clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I 
 
 go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is 
 
 yellow. 
 
 Monday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She 
 
 asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the 
 
  
  
 man in the office that Mr. Hannon can’t come in tod
