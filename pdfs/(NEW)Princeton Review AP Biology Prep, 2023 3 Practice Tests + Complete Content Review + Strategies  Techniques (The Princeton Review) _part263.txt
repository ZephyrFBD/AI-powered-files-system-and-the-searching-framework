3. A G-protein-linked receptor does not act as an enzyme, but instead will bind a different version of a G-protein
(often GTP or GDP) on the intracellular side when a ligand is bound extracellularly. This causes activation of
secondary messengers within the cell. One important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). It is known as
a “universal hunger signal” because it is the second messenger of the hormones epinephrine and glucagon,
which cause energy mobilization. Secondary messengers are usually small molecules that can move quickly
through the cell. They can be made and destroyed quickly and help the signal amplify throughout the cell.
Signal transduction in eukaryotic cells usually involves many steps and complex regulation. Many signal
transduction pathways include protein modifications and phosphorylation cascades, in which a series of protein
kinases add a phosphate group to the next protein in the cascade sequence. In contrast, bacterial cells usually use a
simp
