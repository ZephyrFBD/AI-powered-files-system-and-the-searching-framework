ave opposite displacements at the
instant they pass one another, and they add to zero. The result is called destructive
interference. In Fig. 11–37b, at the instant the two pulses overlap, they produce a
resultant displacement that is greater than the displacement of either separate
pulse, and the result is constructive interference.
You may wonder where the energy is at the moment of destructive interfer-
ence in Fig. 11–37a; the cord may be straight at this instant, but the central parts 
of it are still moving up or down (kinetic energy).
