With this trans-double bond, the unsaturated lipid is relatively linear, as would be expected in a saturated fat. Due to
the relative linearity, they are more likely than unsaturated lipids with cis-double bonds to be a solid at room
temperature.
Phospholipids
Another special class of lipids is known as phospholipids. Phospholipids contain two fatty acid “tails” and one
negatively charged phosphate “head.” Take a look at a typical phospholipid.
Phospholipids are extremely important, mainly because of some unique properties they possess, particularly with
regard to water.
The two fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (“water-hating”). In other words, just like oil and vinegar, fatty acids and
water don’t mix. The reason for this is that fatty acid tails are nonpolar, and nonpolar substances don’t mix well with
polar ones, such as water.
On the other hand, the phosphate “head” of the lipid is hydrophilic (“water-loving”), meaning that it does mix well
with water. Why? It carries a negative ch
