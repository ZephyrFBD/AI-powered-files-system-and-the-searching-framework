mellâ€”have about 4 billion. The overall size of the olfactory
epithelium also differs between species, with that of bloodhounds, for example, being many times larger than that of
humans.
Olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons (neurons with two processes from the cell body). Each neuron has a single dendrite
buried in the olfactory epithelium, and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor-laden, hair-like cilia that trap
odorant molecules. The sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins, and it is the variations in their amino acid chains that
make the receptors sensitive to different odorants. Each olfactory sensory neuron has only one type of receptor on its cilia,
and the receptors are specialized to detect specific odorants, so the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized. When an
odorant binds with a receptor that recognizes it, the sensory neuron associated with the receptor is stimulated. Olfactory
stimulation is the only sensory information that directly reaches the cere
