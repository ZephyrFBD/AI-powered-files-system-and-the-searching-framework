The two common oxyacids of nitrogen are nitric acid 1HNO32 and nitrous acid 
1HNO22 (Figure 22.24). Nitric acid is a strong acid. It is also a powerful oxidizing agent, as 
indicated by the standard reduction potential in the reaction
 
NO3
-1aq2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 3 e - ¡ NO1g2 + 2 H2O1l2 E° = +0.96 V 
[22.41]
Concentrated nitric acid attacks and oxidizes most metals except Au, Pt, Rh, and Ir.
Its largest use is in the manufacture of NH4NO3 for fertilizers. It is also used in the 
production of plastics, drugs, and explosives. Among the explosives made from nitric
