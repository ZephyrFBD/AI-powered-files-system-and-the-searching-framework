choice (D) is incorrect.
2. (B) The oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide are incorporated into glucose during photosynthesis. Choices (A) and
(D) are incorrect because no oxygen atoms are incorporated into NADPH or ATP during photosynthesis. The
oxygen gas released by photosynthesis is a result of the photolysis of water, so choice (C) is also incorrect.
3. (C) The oxygen gas released by photosynthesis is a product of the photolysis of water. Choices (A) and (D) are
incorrect because no oxygen atoms are incorporated into NADPH or ATP during photosynthesis. Choice (B) is
incorrect because the oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide are incorporated into glucose during photosynthesis.
4. (C) The three main parts of the light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle) are carbon fixation, reduction,
and regeneration of RuBP. Choices (A) and (D) are incorrect because there is no electron transport chain
involved in the Calvin cycle. ATP is consumed, not produced, in the Calvin cycle, so choice (B) is also
