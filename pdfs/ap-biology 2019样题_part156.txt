SENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.J.1
Patterns of inheritance of many traits do not 
follow ratios predicted by Mendel’s laws and 
can be identified by quantitative analysis, 
where observed phenotypic ratios statistically 
differ from the predicted ratios—
a. Genes that are adjacent and close to 
one another on the same chromosome 
may appear to be genetically linked; the 
probability that genetically linked genes will 
segregate as a unit can be used to calculate 
the map distance between them.
IST-1.J.2
Some traits are determined by genes on 
sex chromosomes and are known as sex-
linked traits. The pattern of inheritance of 
sex-linked traits can often be predicted from 
data, including pedigree, indicating the parent 
genotype/phenotype and the offspring 
genotypes/phenotypes.
IST-1.J.3
Many traits are the product of multiple genes 
and/or physiological processes acting in 
combination; these traits therefore do not 
segregate in Mendelian patterns.
