d I wonder 
 
 what I did to him. 
 
 I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and 
 
 he has three pounds left in his pocket. I’m not hungry now so I can go 
 
 up one side of O’Connell Street and down the other and search pubs 
 
 on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson’s, how could I miss him 
 
 with his singing, 
 
 ’Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise 
 
 Would be shining at me out of somebody’s eyes. 
 
 ’Tis my private affair what my feelings would be 
 
 While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me. 
 
 My heart is banging away in my chest and I don’t know what to do 
 
 because I know I’m raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I 
 
 can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg 
 
 and running out again but I don’t because we have the mornings by the 
 
 fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and 
 
 if he’s there drunk and buying pints with the baby’s money he has that
