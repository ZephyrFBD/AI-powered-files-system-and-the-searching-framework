ted to 
Ag1NH322
+ and approach the problem as though we are concerned 
with the dissociation of Ag1NH322
+ rather than its formation. To 
facilitate this approach, we need to reverse Equation 17.22 and 
make the corresponding change to the equilibrium constant:
Ag1NH322

1.7 * 107 = 5.9 * 10-8
Solve If 3Ag+4 is 0.010 M initially, 3Ag1NH322
+4 will be 0.010 M 
following addition of the NH3. We construct a table to solve this 
equilibrium problem. Note that the NH3 concentration given in 
the problem is an equilibrium concentration rather than an initial 
concentration.

Because 3Ag+4 is very small, we can assume x is small compared to 
0.010. Substituting these  
values into the equilibrium-constant ex-
