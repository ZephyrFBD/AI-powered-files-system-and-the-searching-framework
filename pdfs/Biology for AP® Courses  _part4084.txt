ally a spherical layer of
cells (the blastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). Mammals at this stage form a structure
called the blastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown in Figure
34.21b. During cleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into
multiple smaller cells. Each cell within the blastula is called a blastomere.
Figure 34.21 (a) During cleavage, the zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells without increasing in size. (b) The
cells rearrange themselves to form a hollow ball with a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity called the blastula. (credit a:

Cleavage can take place in two ways: holoblastic (total) cleavage or meroblastic (partial) cleavage. The type of cleavage
depends on the amount o
