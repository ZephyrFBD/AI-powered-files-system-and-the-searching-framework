t appears only in nucleic acids. Nitrogen is
found in nucleic acids and proteins, while carbon is found in all four
organic compounds, meaning that phosphorus must be the only
deficient element. Because only element II is deficient, (B) must be the
correct answer. Phosphorus is found in nucleic acids, ATP, and
phospholipids, which may explain the minor diﬀerence in lipid
generation between both water sources as well.

Metabolic strategies are the means by which organisms obtain the
energy and nutrients they need to live and reproduce. The specific
metabolic properties of diﬀerent organisms are the major factors in
determining their ecological niches. Organisms are oȇen divided
based on (1) how they obtain carbon (autotrophic vs. heterotrophic),
(2) how they obtain reducing elements used in energy conservation or
biosynthetic reactions (lithotrophic vs. organotrophic), and (3) how
they obtain energy for living or growing (chemotrophic vs.
phototrophic). Auto
