culate the half-life for breakdown at a temperature of -15 °C.
 14.107 The following mechanism has been proposed for the reac-
tion of NO with H2 to form N2O and H2O:
NO1g2 + NO1g2 ¡ N2O21g2
N2O21g2 + H21g2 ¡ N2O1g2 + H2O1g2
 
 (a) Show that the elementary reactions of the proposed 
mechanism add to provide a balanced equation for the re-
action. (b) Write a rate law for each elementary reaction in 
the mechanism. (c) Identify any intermediates in the mech-
anism. (d) The observed rate law is rate = k3NO423H24. If 
the proposed mechanism is correct, what can we conclude 
about the relative speeds of the ﬁrst and second reactions?
 14.108 Ozone in the upper atmosphere can be destroyed by the 
following two-step mechanism:
  Cl1g2 + O31g2 ¡ ClO1g2 + O21g2
ClO1g2 + O1g2 ¡ Cl1g2 + O21g2
 
 (a) What is the overall equation for this process? (b) What 
is the catalyst in the reaction? (c) What is the intermedi-
ate in the reaction?
