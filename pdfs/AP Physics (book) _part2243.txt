The other element is probably nitrogen
(see the Periodic Table, inside the back cover).
NOTE The unknown could also be an isotope such as carbon-14

FIGURE 20–42 (a) An unmagnetized
piece of iron is made up of domains
that are randomly arranged. Each
domain is like a tiny magnet; the
arrows represent the magnetization
direction, with the arrowhead being
the N pole. (b) In a magnet, the
domains are preferentially aligned in
one direction (down in this case),
and may be altered in size by the
magnetization process.

Domains and Hysteresis
We saw in Section 20–1 that iron (and a few other materials) can be made into
strong mag
