 Imagine that you are asked to repeat the reptile/mammal comparison of oxygen 
consumption, but at a temperature of 22°C. Predict how these results would differ 
from the measurements made at 10°C, and explain your prediction in terms of 
metabolism.

Although encouraged to develop their own means of reporting data, students might find 
the following tables and graph helpful for recording their data/results and proposing 
their plan for their independent, inquiry-based investigation(s). If students use a gas 
pressure sensor with computer interface, the computer will generate the graph on the 
screen; however, you may elect to have students draw, label, and annotate any graphs.
