 strands of an unknown sample of RNA allows
scientists to find out if both of them are similar
or not.

Comparison of DNA from a known source or
individual with analysis of the sugars and
phosphates in strands of an unknown sample of
DNA allows scientists to find out if both of them
are similar or not.

a.
Rosalind Franklin used X-ray diffraction
methods to demonstrate the helical nature of
DNA, while Watson and Crick formulated the
double stranded structural model of DNA.
b.
Rosalind Franklin, Watson and Crick first
employed the technique of X-ray diffraction to
understand the storage of DNA. Since it did not
work out, Watson and Crick then ran
experiments to ascertain the DNA structure.
