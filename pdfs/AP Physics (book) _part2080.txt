ncreases by 45 V: that is,
From c to a the potential decreases through the two resistances by an amount
Thus we have
or
(ii)
where we have omitted the units (volts and amps) so we can more easily see
the algebra. For our second loop, we take the outer loop ahdefga. (We could
have chosen the lower loop abcdefga instead.) Again we start at point a, and
going to point h we have
Next,
But when we 
take our positive test charge from d to e, it actually is going uphill, against the
current—or at least against the assumed direction of the current, which is
what counts in this calculation. Thus 
has a positive sign.
Similarly,
From f to g there is a decrease in potential of 
80 V because we go from the high potential terminal of the battery to the low.
Thus 
Finally,
and the sum of the potential changes
around this loop is
(iii)
Our major work is done. The rest is algebra.
5. Solve the equations. We have three equations—labeled (i), (ii), and (iii)—
and three unknowns. From Eq. (iii) we have
