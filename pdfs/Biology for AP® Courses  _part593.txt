With the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself
towards the interior of the cell.
6.
The carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions
are released into the cytoplasm. The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process
starts again.
Several things have happened as a result of this process. At this point, there are more sodium ions outside
of the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out. For every three ions of sodium that move
out, two ions of potassium move in. This results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to
the exterior. This difference in charge is important to creating the conditions necessary for the secondary
process. Therefore, the sodium-potassium pump is an electrogenic pump (a pump that creates a charge
imbalance) contributing to the membrane potential.
What will happen to the opening of the sodium-potassi
