on the diagram, Fig. 33–6. Most stars fall along the diagonal band termed the
main sequence. Starting at the lower right we find the coolest stars: by Wien’s
law,
constant, their light output peaks at long wavelengths, so they are red-
dish in color. They are also the least luminous and therefore of low mass. Farther
up toward the left we find hotter and more luminous stars that are whitish, like our
Sun. Still farther up we find even more luminous and more massive stars, bluish in
color. Stars that fall on this diagonal band are called main-sequence stars. There
are also stars that f
