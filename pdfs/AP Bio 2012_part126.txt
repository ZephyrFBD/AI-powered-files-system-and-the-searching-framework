unable to absorb water between days 14â€“21. In addition, because the seedlings 
were capable of doing so during the first 14 days, there is no evidence to support 
this claim that they could not absorb water after day 14.
(B)
This option is incorrect because there is no evidence that green seedlings  
were taller.
(C)
This option is correct. The only difference between the two plants after day 
14 was the leaf color. Without chlorophyll, the yellow seedlings could not 
absorb enough light energy to convert to chemical energy to sustain growth. 
Therefore, no yellow seedlings were found alive in either dish after day 21.
(D)
This option is incorrect because there are no data supporting a higher rate of 
respiration in yellow seedlings compared to green seedlings.
