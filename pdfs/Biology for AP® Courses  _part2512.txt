where Pi stands for inorganic phosphate. The total fixed nitrogen through BNF is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per
year. Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture.
Cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. In soil, members of the genus Clostridium
are examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants, providing the
most important source of BNF. Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by a factor of 10. Soil
bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules, specialized structures
where nitrogen fixation occurs (Figure 22.27). Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated by oxygen, so
the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. This process provides a natural and inexpensive
plant fertilizer, as it reduces atmospheric
