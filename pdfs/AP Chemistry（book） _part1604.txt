 mole percent is the mole fraction times 100. Therefore, the 
mole fraction of O2 is 0.180. Equation 10.16 gives:
P
O2 = 10.18021745 torr2 = 134 torr
(b) Tabulating the given variables and converting to appropriate 
units, we have:
 P
O2 = 1134 torr2a 1 atm
760 torrb = 0.176 atm
 
V = 121 L
 
nO2 = ?

T = 295 K
Solving the ideal-gas equation for nO2, we have:
 
nO2 = P

Check The units check out, and the answer seems to be the right 
order of magnitude.

A 4.0-L vessel containing N2 at STP and a 2.0-L vessel containing 
H2 at STP are connected by a valve. If the valve is opened allowing 
the two gases to mix, what is the mole fraction of hydrogen in the 
mixture? (a) 0.034 (b) 0.33 (c) 0.50 (d) 0.67 (e) 0.96
