mol of SO2Cl2 is placed in a 15.00-L vessel at 303 K.
 15.75 The value of the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction 
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2 changes in the following 
manner as a function of temperature
Temperature (°C)

 (a) Based on the changes in Kc is this reaction exothermic 
or endothermic? (b) Use the standard enthalpies of for-
mation given in Appendix C to determine the ∆H for this 
reaction at standard conditions. Does this value agree 
with your prediction from part (a)? (c) If 0.025 mole of 
gaseous NH3 is added to a 1.00 L container and heated to 
500 °C, what is the concentration of NH3 once the sample 
reaches equilibrium?

 An equilibrium mixture in a 5.00-L vessel at 100 °C con-
tains 3.22 g of NOBr, 3.08 g of NO, and 4.19 g of Br2.  
(a) Calculate Kc. (b) What is the total pressure exerted by
