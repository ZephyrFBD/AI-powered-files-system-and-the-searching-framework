An electrical charge
spontaneously pulses from AV node causing two
atria to contract. The pulse reaches SA node
where it pauses before spreading to the walls of
the ventricles. It enters the bundle of His, then to
left and right bundle branches extending through
the interventricular septum. Purkinje fibers
conduct impulse from the apex up the
ventricular myocardium, causing the ventricles
to contract. This pause allows the atria to empty
their contents into the ventricles before the
ventricles pump out the blood.

during diastole. An electrical charge
