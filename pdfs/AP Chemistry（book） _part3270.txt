1 mol of electrons is 96,485 C. A coulomb is the quantity of charge passing a point in a 
circuit in 1 s when the current is 1 ampere (A). Therefore, the number of coulombs pass-
ing through a cell can be obtained by multiplying the current in amperes by the elapsed 
time in seconds.
 
coulombs = amperes * seconds

Figure 20.30 shows how the quantities of substances produced or consumed in elec-
trolysis are related to the quantity of electrical charge used. The same relationships can 
also be applied to voltaic cells. In other words, electrons can be thought of as “reagents” 
in electrolysis reactions.
