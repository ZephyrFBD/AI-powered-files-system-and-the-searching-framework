maximum number of electrons that can occupy each subshell.
Because the energy levels depend almost entirely on the values of n and 
it
is customary to specify the electron configuration simply by giving the n value and
the appropriate letter for 
with the number of electrons in each subshell given as 
a superscript. The ground-state configuration of sodium, for example, is written as
This is simplified in the Periodic Table by specifying the configuration
only of the outermost electrons and any other nonfilled subshells (see Table 28–4
here, and the Periodic Table inside the back cover).
