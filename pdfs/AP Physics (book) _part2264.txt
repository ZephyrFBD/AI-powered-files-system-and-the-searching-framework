e
maximum force on it is 0.625 N when placed in a uniform
0.0800-T field?
3. (I) A 240-m length of wire stretches between two towers and
carries a 120-A current. Determine the magnitude of the
force on the wire due to the Earth’s magnetic field of
which makes an angle of 68° with the wire.
4. (I) A 2.6-m length of horizontal wire carries a 4.5-A current
toward the south. The dip angle of the Earth’s magnetic
field makes an angle of 41° to the wire. Estimate the magni-
tude of the magnetic force on the wire due to the Earth’s
magnetic field of 
.
5. (I) The magnetic force per meter on a wire is measured to
be only 45% of its maximum possible value. What is the
angle between the wire and the magnetic field?
5.5 * 10–5 T
5.0 * 10–5 T

6. (II) The force on a wire carrying 6.45 A is a maximum of
1.28 N when placed between the pole faces of a magnet. If
the pole faces are 55.5 cm in diameter, what is the approx-
imate strength of the magnetic field?
7. (II) The force on a wire is a m
