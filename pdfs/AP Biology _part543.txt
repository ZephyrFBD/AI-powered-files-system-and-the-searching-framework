these limiting factors, it will grow exponentially and
exceed the carrying capacity of its ecosystem. As a result, the
population will decrease or die.
A community consists of all the organisms that live in one area.
They are characterized by their diversity and density. The most
successful communities are those that have the greatest diversity
and are not so dense that they exceed the carrying capacity of the
ecosystem. A diverse community has a better chance for survival in
a changing environment. This idea connects with the concepts of
natural selection and evolution. Interactions within a community
are complex. However, they can be divided into five categories:
competition, predation, herbivory, symbiosis, and facilitation.
All living things require a constant input of free energy. Organisms
must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce,
and maintain homeostasis. When you discuss the flow of energy in
a food chain, remember that producers are autotrophs; they
capture
