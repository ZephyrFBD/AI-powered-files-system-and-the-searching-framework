dampen (reduce) the oscillation of a vibrating system, which is referred to as
magnetic damping.

Eddy currents, however, can be a problem. For example, eddy currents induced
in the armature of a motor or generator produce heat 
and waste energy.
To reduce the eddy currents, the armatures are laminated; that is, they are made of
very thin sheets of iron that are well insulated from one another (used also in
transformers, Fig. 21–23). The total path length of the eddy currents is confined
to each slab, which increases the total resistance; hence the current is less and
there is less wasted energy.
Walk-through metal detectors (Fig. 21–21) use electromagnetic induction and
eddy currents to detect metal objects. Several coils are situated in the walls of the
walk-through at different heights. In one technique, the coils are given brief pulses
of current, hundreds or thousands
