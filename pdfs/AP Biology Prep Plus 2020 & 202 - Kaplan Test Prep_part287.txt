hrough transpiration because dry conditions
cause greater evaporation. Thus, a xerophyte could be expected to see
less dramatic changes in transpiration rates when placed in
environments with diﬀering humidity levels, making (C) correct. (A) is
incorrect because it reverses the diﬀerence between the two plants.
(B) is incorrect because a smaller plant would be expected to have a

lower absolute rate of transpiration than a larger plant, but not a lower
diﬀerence in transpiration rates at two distinct humidity levels. (D) is
incorrect because humidity matters more than temperature for
transpiration; for instance, plants would be expected to have lower
transpiration rates in hot, moist environments like tropical rainforests
than in hot, dry environments like deserts.

Learning Objective: 7.6
In transpiration, plants lose water through their stomata. The only way
for the plant to replace the lost water is by pulling it up through its
roots and stem by capillary ac
