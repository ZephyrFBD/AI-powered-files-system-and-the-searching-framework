reedom of motion that causes molecules to 
spread out when not restrained by physical barriers or chemical bonds.
The most common way of describing an increase in entropy is the increase in the 
randomness, or disorder, of the system. Another way likens an entropy increase to an 
increased dispersion (spreading out) of energy because there is an increase in the number 
of ways the positions and energies of the molecules can be distributed throughout the 
system. Each description (randomness or energy dispersal) is conceptually helpful if 
applied correctly.
Making Qualitative Predictions about âˆ†S
It is usually not difficult to estimate qualitatively how the entropy of a system changes 
during a simple process. As noted earlier, an increase in either the temperature or the vol-
ume of a system leads to an increase in the number of microstates, and hence an increase 
in the entropy. One more factor that correlates with number of microstates is the num-
ber of independently moving particl
