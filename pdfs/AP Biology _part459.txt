 genes might be upregulated or
downregulated by other genes, resulting in different outcomes in the
different species. Two examples are homeotic genes and heterochrony.
HOMEOTIC GENES
Homeotic genes are master regulatory genes that control spatial
organization of body parts. They determine such features as where wings
or legs will develop on an insect or where the petals go on a flower. One
particular homeotic gene, called a Hox gene, provides positional
information in developing embryos. Among crustaceans, a change in the
location of two Hox genes will transform antennae into legs. (See Figure
11.7.)

HETEROCHRONY
Heterochrony is an evolutionary change in the rate or timing of the
development of body parts. Figure 11.8 shows how the chimp and human
skulls compare as they develop. As infants, they are very similar. As the
chimp matures, the face becomes more prognathic (sticks out) and the jaw
and teeth become larger and mor
