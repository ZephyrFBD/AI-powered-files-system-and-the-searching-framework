oactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P, the radioactivity
was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant.
Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce
more phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (Figure 14.4).

Figure 14.4 In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S,
which labels protein, or 32P, which labels DNA. Only 32P entered the bacterial cells, indicating that DNA is the genetic
material.
Around this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found
that the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine,
