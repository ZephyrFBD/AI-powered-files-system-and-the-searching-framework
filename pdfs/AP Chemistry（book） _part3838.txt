reaction is shown in Figure 24.9. The 
ﬁrst energy maximum represents the transition state in the ﬁrst step, 
and the second maximum represents the transition state in the sec-
ond step. The energy minimum represents the energies of the inter-
mediate species, CH3C

H ¬CH2CH3 and Br-.
To show electron movement in reactions like these, chemists 
often use curved arrows pointing in the direction of electron ﬂow. For 
the addition of HBr to 2-butene, for example, the shifts in electron 
positions are shown as

Is the reaction in Figure 24.9 spontaneous or not, assuming 
the change in energy equals the change in ∆G?
