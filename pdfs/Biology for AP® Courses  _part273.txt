 are all hexoses. They are structural isomers, meaning they have the
same chemical formula (C6H12O6) but a different arrangement of atoms.
Identify each sugar as an aldose or ketose.
1.
fructose
2.
galactose
3.
glucose
a.
Glucose and galactose are aldoses. Fructose is a ketose
b.
Glucose and fructose are aldoses. Galactose is a ketose.
c.
Galactose and fructose are ketoses. Glucose is an aldose.
d.
Glucose and fructose are ketoses. Galactose is an aldose.
Glucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides (hexoses), meaning they have the same chemical formula
but have slightly different structures. Glucose and galactose are aldoses, and fructose is a ketose.
Monosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions they are usually found in
ring forms (Figure 3.7). Glucose in a ring form can have two different arrangements of the hydroxyl group (OH) around
the anomeric carbon (carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the process of ring formati
