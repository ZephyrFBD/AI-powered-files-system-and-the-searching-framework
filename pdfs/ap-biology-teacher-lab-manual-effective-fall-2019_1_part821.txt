de a 
measurement at 2.5 hours, we would have found 50 mg of A left. In a similar way, we 
can find out from our graph at what time a given amount of A, say 65 mg, would be left. 
We have merely to find the line that represents 65 mg on the vertical scale and follow 
it across until it cuts the line graph at point Y. Then we see 1.75 hours on the “Time” 
scale opposite Y. This tells us that had we wished to stop the reaction with 65 mg of A 
remaining, we would have had to do so after 1.75 hours. 
You will notice that part of the graph has been drawn with a broken line. In making 
a line graph we are properly allowed to connect only the points representing our actual 
measurements. It is possible that measurements made after 3 hours will give points 
that will fall on the broken-line extension of the graph, but this is not necessarily so. In 
fact, the reaction may begin to slow up perceptibly, so that much less A is used up in 
the fourth hour than in the third hour. Not having made a
