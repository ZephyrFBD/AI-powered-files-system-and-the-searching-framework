ding to stable nuclei.
 21.3 ▶  Nuclear Transmutations Explore 
nuclear transmutations, which are nuclear 
reactions induced by bombardment of a 
nucleus by a neutron or an accelerated 
charged particle.
 
21.4 ▶  Rates of Radioactive Decay Learn 
that radioisotope decays are first-order kinetic 
processes with characteristic half-lives. 
Decay rates can be used to determine the age 
of ancient artifacts and geological formations.
 21.5 ▶  Detection of Radioactivity Learn 
that the radiation emitted by a radioactive 
substance can be detected by a variety 
of devices, including dosimeters, Geiger 
counters, and scintillation counters.
 
21.6 ▶  Energy Changes in Nuclear 
Reactions Learn that energy changes in 
nuclear reactions are related to mass changes 
via Einstein’s equation, E = mc2. The 
nuclear binding energy of a nucleus is the 
difference between the mass of the nucleus 
and the sum of the masses of its nucleons.
