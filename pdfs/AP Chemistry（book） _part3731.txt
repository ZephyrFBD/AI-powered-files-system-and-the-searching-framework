e energy needed to place 
the sixth electron in a t2 orbital is less than that needed to place it in an e orbital. We end 
up with four t2 electrons and two e electrons.

▲ Figure 23.31 Two possibilities for adding a fourth electron to a d3 octahedral complex. Whether  
the fourth electron goes into a t2 orbital or into an e orbital depends on the relative energies of the  
crystal-field splitting energy and the spin-pairing energy.

∆ less than spin-
pairing energy, 
electrons singly 
occupy each e 
orbital before 
pairing in the t2 
orbitals.
∆ greater than 
spin-pairing 
energy, t2 
orbitals are filled 
with electrons 
before occupying 
the e orbitals.
