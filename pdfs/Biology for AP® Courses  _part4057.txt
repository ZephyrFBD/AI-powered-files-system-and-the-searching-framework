a large number of
sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse. The labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of
tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva. The labia majora derive from
the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male. The labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the
labia majora. These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra. The mons pubis and the anterior portion of the
labia majora become covered with hair during adolescence; the labia minora is hairless. The greater vestibular glands are
found at the sides of the vaginal opening and provide lubrication during intercourse.
