nd a practical device to do so was
invented only about 1700 with the development of the steam engine.
The basic idea behind any heat engine is that mechanical energy can be
obtained from thermal energy only when heat is allowed to flow from a high 
temperature to a low temperature. In the process, some of the heat can then be
transformed to mechanical work, as diagrammed schematically in Fig. 15–11.
Useful heat engines run in a repeating cycle: that is, the system returns repeat-
edly to its starting point, and thus can run continuously. In each cycle the change
in internal energy of the system is 
because it returns to the starting state.
Thus a heat input 
at a high temperature 
is partly transformed into work W and
partly exhausted as heat 
at a lower temperature 
(Fig. 15–11). By conservation
of energy,
The high and low temperatures,
and 
are called
the operating temperatures of the engine. Note carefully that we are now using a
new (and intuitive) sign convention for heat engines:
