it would have zero volume, and at lower tempera-

is the lowest temperature possible; indeed, many other more recent experiments
indicate that this is so. This temperature is called the absolute zero of tempera-
ture. Its value has been determined to be 
Absolute zero forms the basis of a temperature scale known as the absolute
scale or Kelvin scale, and it is used extensively in scientific work. On this scale
the temperature is specified as degrees Kelvin or, preferably, simply as kelv
vins (K)
without the degree sign. The intervals are the same as for the Celsius scale, but
the zero on this scale (0 K) is chosen as absolute zero. Thus the freezing point of
water (0°C) is 273.15 K, and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. Indeed, any
temperature on the Celsius scale can be changed to kelvins by adding 273.15 to it:
Now let us look at Fig. 13–15b, where the graph of the volume of a gas versu
