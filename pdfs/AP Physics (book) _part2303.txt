EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 590, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
A loop of wire in a magnetic field. A square loop of wire
of side
is in a uniform magnetic field
What is the mag-
netic flux in the loop (a) when 
is perpendicular to the face of the loop and 
(b) when 
is at an angle of 30° to the area of the loop? (c) What is the magnitude
of the averag
