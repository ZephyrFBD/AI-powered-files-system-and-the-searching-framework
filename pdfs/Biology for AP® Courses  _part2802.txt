nd cells that line the small intestine allow for diffusion.
Furthermore, the relationship between metabolic rate and body mass is typically an inverse one: The smaller the animal, the
higher its metabolism, with mice having a higher metabolic rate than, for example, elephants. Because mice have a greater
surface area-to-volume ratio for their mass than larger animals, they lose heat at a faster rate and, consequently, require
more energy to maintain constant body temperature.
Speaking of temperature, we learned that the body temperature of ectothermic animals varies according to environmental
temperatures. When snakes need to warm up, they bask in the sun; when they need to cool down, they go into the shade.
Other animals, including mice, kangaroos and humans, are endothermic because they are able to maintain a fairly constant
internal body temperature despite environmental temperatures; for example, shivering generates heat, whereas sweating
returns our body temperature to its normal
