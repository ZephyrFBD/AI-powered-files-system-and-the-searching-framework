 of the Lab
This investigation requires a minimum of four laboratory periods of about 45 minutes 
each, plus time for discussions and measurements. There are three subparts, each 
requiring one class period. An additional class period will be needed for discussion. You 
may also assign the prelab questions or online activities/tutorials for homework. You will 
need to set aside time to prepare the solutions and the agar for your students. 
 Safety and Housekeeping
■
The HCl and NaOH solutions will cause chemical burns. Students must wear safety 
goggles or glasses, gloves, and aprons and prepare the NaOH and HCl solutions in a 
hood. Have the students use these solutions in spill-proof plastic trays or pans. 
 ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK
■
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to cell 
structure and function, modeling cellular processes, and the movement of materials 
through biological membranes (big idea 2).
