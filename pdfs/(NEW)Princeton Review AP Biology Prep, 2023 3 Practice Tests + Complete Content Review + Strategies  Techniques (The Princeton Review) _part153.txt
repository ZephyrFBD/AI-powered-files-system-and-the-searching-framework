ain carbon atoms are called inorganic compounds. For example, salt (NaCl) is an inorganic compound.
Carbon is important for life because it is a versatile atom, meaning that it has the ability to bind not only with other
carbons but also with a number of other elements including nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. The resulting
molecules are key in carrying out the activities necessary for life. Most macromolecules are chains of building
blocks, called polymers. The individual building blocks of a polymer are called monomers.
Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis Reactions
Break Down the Words
Dehydration = removal of water
Synthesis = Creation
Hydro = water
Lysis = breakdown
Polymers are formed through dehydration synthesis (or condensation) reactions. In these reactions, a water
molecule is lost, and a larger compound is formed. Polymers can also be broken down into monomers. That’s called
hydrolysis, which means “water” (hydro-) and “breaking” (-lysis). The water breaks the bond between
