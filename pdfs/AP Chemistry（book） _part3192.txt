red 1anode2 = -0.76 V
Thus, a standard reduction potential of -0.76 V can be assigned to the reduction of Zn2+ 
to Zn:
 
Zn2+1aq, 1 M2 + 2 e- ¡ Zn1s2 E°
red = -0.76 V 
We write the reaction as a reduction even though the Zn reaction in Figure 20.9 is an oxi-
dation. Whenever we assign an electrical potential to a half-reaction, we write the reaction as 
a reduction. Half-reactions, however, are reversible, being able to operate as either reduc-
tions or oxidations. Consequently, half-reactions are sometimes written using two arrows 
1∆2 between reactants and products, as in equilibrium reactions.
The standard reduction potentials for other half-reactions can be determined in a 
fashion analogous to that used for the Zn2+>Zn half-reaction. Table 20.1 lists some stan-
dard reduction potentials; a more complete list is found in Appendix E. These standard
