 cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there
was at the end of meiosis I.
Figure 11.7 Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one round of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two
nuclear divisions. The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells
resulting from mitosis are diploid and identical to the parent cell.

The Mystery of the Evolution of Meiosis
Some characteristics of organisms are so widespread and fundamental that it is sometimes difficult to
remember that they evolved like other simpler traits. Meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series
of cellular events that biologists have had trouble hypothesizing and testing how it may have evolved.
Although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages,
it is important to separate
