 each
exert an attractive force on the other. If the two charges are
the same type, each repels the other.
The magnitude of the force one point charge exerts on
another is proportional to the product of their charges, and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
them:
(16;1, 16;2)
this is Coulomb’s law.
We think of an electric field as existing in space around any
charge or group of charges. The force on another charged object
is then said to be due to the electric field present at its location.
The electric field,
, at any point in space due to one or
more charges, is defined as the force per unit charge that would
act on a tiny positive test charge q placed at that point:

The total electric field at a point in space is equal to the
vector sum of the individual fields due to each contributing
