ther they work to regulate the body. Epinephrine (adrenaline), for
example, functions as the fight-or-flight hormone secreted by the adrenal
gland as well as a neurotransmitter that sends a message from one neuron
to another.
Hormones
Hormones are produced in ductless (endocrine) glands and move through
the blood to a specific target cell, tissue, or organ that can be far from the
original endocrine gland. They can produce an immediate short-lived
response, the way adrenaline (epinephrine) speeds up the heart rate and
increases blood sugar. They can dramatically alter the development of an
entire organism, the way ecdysone controls metamorphosis in insects.
Tropic hormones have a far-reaching effect because they stimulate other
glands to release hormones. For example, the anterior pituitary releases
TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), which stimulates the thyroid to
release thyroxine. Other types of chemical messengers reach their target by
special means. Pheromones in the urine of a do
