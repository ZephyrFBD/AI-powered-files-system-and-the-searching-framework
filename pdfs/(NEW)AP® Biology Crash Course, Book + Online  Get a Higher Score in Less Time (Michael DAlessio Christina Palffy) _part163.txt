2. Ozone Layer—the ozone layer absorbs harmful UV light. CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol cans
and refrigeration units destroy the ozone by reducing it to oxygen.
3. Greenhouse Effect—carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels act as a trap of solar
heat in the atmosphere. Increases in carbon dioxide warm the air and accelerate the greenhouse effect.
This is thought to be the major cause of global warming. Deforestation is also a major contributor to
the greenhouse effect.
4. Despite these harmful effects on the ecosystem, some success has been achieved in reversing some of
them.
i.
Thinning of the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere has been addressed.
ii. An acid precipitation reduction plan has been implemented in some countries, including the U.S.
iii. Bans or reductions on toxins—such as DDT, PCBs, and mercury—have been achieved in some
countries.
iv. Climate change due to rising temperatures of the Earth has spurred development of models to
