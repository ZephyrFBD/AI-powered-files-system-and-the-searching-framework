Figure 23.3 No. The radius decreases first and then flattens out 
before increasing on moving past group 8B, while the effective 
nuclear charge increases steadily on moving left to right across the 
transition metal series. Figure 23.4 Zn2+. Figure 23.5 The 4s 
orbitals are always empty in transition metal ions, so all of the ions 
shown in this table have empty 4s orbitals. The 3d orbitals are only 
empty for those ions that have lost all of their valence electrons:  
Sc3+, Ti 4+, V 5+, Cr 6+, and Mn7+. Figure 23.6 The electron spins 
would tend to align with the direction of the magnetic field.  
Figure 23.8 No. If you start with a chloride ion on one vertex of 
the octahedron and then generate structures by placing the second 
chloride ion on any of the other five vertices you will get one com-
plex that is the trans isomer and four complexes that are equivalent 
to the cis isomer shown in this figure. Figure
