esolution of a lens. The first is lens aberrations.
As we just saw, because of spherical and other aberrations, a point object is not a
point on the image but a tiny blob. Careful design of compound lenses can reduce
aberrations significantly, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. The second factor
that limits resolution is diffraction, which cannot be corrected for because it is a
natural result of the wave nature of light. We discuss it now.
In Section 24–5, we saw that because light travels as a wave, light from a point
source passing through a slit is spread out into a diffraction pattern (Figs. 24–19
and 24–21). A lens, because it has edges, acts like a round slit. When a lens forms
the image of a point object, the image is actually a tiny diffraction pattern. Thus
an image would be blurred even if aberrations were absent.
In the analysis that follows, we assume that the lens is free of aberrations, so we
can concentrate on diffraction effects and how much they limit the resolut
