conservation equation will have the form

Evaporation
The latent heat to change a liquid to a gas is needed not only at the boiling point.
Water can change from the liquid to the gas phase even at room temperature.
This process is called evaporation (see previous Chapter, Section 13–12).The value of
the heat of vaporization of water increases slightly with a decrease in temperature:
at 20°C, for example, it is 
compared to 
at 100°C. When water evaporates, the remaining liquid cools,
because the energy required (the latent heat of vaporization) comes from the
water itself; so its internal energy, and therefore its temperature, must drop.‡

‡Also from the point of view of kinetic theory, evaporation is a cooling process because it is the fastest-
