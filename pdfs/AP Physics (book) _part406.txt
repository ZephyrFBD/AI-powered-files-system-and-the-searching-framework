Inclines
Now we consider what happens when an object slides down an incline, such as 
a hill or ramp. Such problems are interesting because gravity is the accelerating
force, yet the acceleration is not vertical. Solving problems is usually easier if we
choose the xy coordinate system so the x axis points along the incline (the direction
of motion) and the y axis is perpendicular to the incline, as shown in Fig. 4–33.
Note also that the normal force is not vertical, but is perpendicular to the sloping
surface of the
