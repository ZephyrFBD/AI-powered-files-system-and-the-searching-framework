seconds. To do so we can change km h to m s
(see Section 1–6, and Example 1–5):
Then
We almost always write the units for acceleration as 
(meters per
second squared) instead of 
This is possible because:
Note that acceleration tells us how quickly the velocity changes, whereas
velocity tells us how quickly the position changes.

Velocity and acceleration. (a) If the velocity
of an object is zero, does it mean that the acceleration is zero? (b) If the
acceleration is zero, does it mean that the velocity is zero? Think of some examples.
RESPONSE A zero velocity does not necessarily mean that the acceleration
is zero, nor does a zero acceleration mean that the velocity is zero. (a) For
example, when you put your foot on the gas pedal of your car which is at rest,
the velocity starts from zero but the acceleration is not zero since the ve
