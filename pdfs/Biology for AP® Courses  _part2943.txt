other important requirement is nitrogen, and protein catabolism
provides a source of nitrogen; amino acids from protein breakdown are building blocks for new proteins. The carbon and
nitrogen derived from amino acids also become building blocks for nucleic acids. Excess nitrogen is excreted because it
is toxic. Although the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules necessary for function from organic precursors,
some essential nutrients must be consumed from food. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are
required in small quantities for many enzymes to function. (No, you do not need to memorize the table of vitamins and their
functions!) Deficiencies in nutrients can have detrimental effects on an animalâ€™s health. For example, among other things,
vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption for bone development, and vitamin C is critical to multiple biochemical
pathways, including immune function.
