y of our genes are identical or similar 
to those found in other species.
Suppose you identify a single gene that is responsible for a particular disease in fruit 
flies. Is that same gene found in humans? Does it cause a similar disease? It would take 
you nearly 10 years to read through the entire human genome to try to locate the same 
sequence of bases as that in fruit flies. This definitely isnâ€™t practical, so a sophisticated 
technological method is needed.
Bioinformatics is a field that combines statistics, mathematical modeling, and 
computer science to analyze biological data. Using bioinformatics methods, entire 
genomes can be quickly compared in order to detect genetic similarities and differences. 
An extremely powerful bioinformatics tool is BLAST, which stands for Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool. Using BLAST, you can input a gene sequence of interest and 
search entire genomic libraries for identical or similar sequences in a matter of seconds.
