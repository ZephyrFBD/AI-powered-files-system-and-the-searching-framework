histones causes the nucleosomes to pack tightly together,
inactivating one of the X chromosomes.
How the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the histone proteins and on the DNA. These signals
are tags added to histone proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed (Figure
16.8 depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as
needed. They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in
the protein or to the nucleotides of the DNA. The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how tightly
wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of
the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large
positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acety
