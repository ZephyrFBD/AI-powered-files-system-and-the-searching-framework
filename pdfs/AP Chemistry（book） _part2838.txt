lacial acetic acid 1CH3COOH2 are 
available. Glacial acetic acid is 99% CH3COOH by mass 
and has a density of 1.05 g>mL. If the buffer is to be 0.15 M 
in CH3COOH, how many grams of CH3COONa and how 
many milliliters of glacial acetic acid must be used?
 17.90  A sample of 0.2140 g of an unknown monoprotic acid was 
dissolved in 25.0 mL of water and titrated with 0.0950 M  
NaOH. The acid required 30.0 mL of base to reach the 
equivalence point. (a) What is the molar mass of the acid? 
 
(b) After 15.0 mL of base had been added in the titration, 
the pH was found to be 6.50. What is the Ka for the un-
known acid?
 17.91  A sample of 0.1687 g of an unknown monoprotic acid was 
dissolved in 25.0 mL of water and titrated with 0.1150 M 
NaOH. The acid required 15.5 mL of base to reach the 
equivalence point. (a) What is the molar mass of the acid? 
(b) After 7.25 mL of base had been added in the titration, 
the pH was found to be 2.85. What is the Ka for the un-
known acid?
