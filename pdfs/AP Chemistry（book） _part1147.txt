in 
Figure 5.14, the formation of nonmetal oxides is also often very exothermic and thus 
energetically favorable.
In our discussion of the alkali metals, we noted two less common oxygen anions—
the peroxide 1O2
2 -2 ion and the superoxide 1O2
-2 ion. Compounds of these ions often 
react to produce an oxide and O2:
 
2 H2O21aq2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2 + O21g2 ∆H° = -196.1 kJ

*A more realistic description is one where an H+ ion is transferred from HCl to H2O forming Cl- 
and H3O+. We will explore this chemistry in detail in Chapter 16.
For this reason, bottles of aqueous hydrogen peroxide are topped with caps that are ab
