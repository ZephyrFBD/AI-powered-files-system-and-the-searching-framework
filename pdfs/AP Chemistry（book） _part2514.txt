proton to another substance.

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
Thus, when HCl dissolves in water (Equation 16.3), HCl acts as a Brønsted–Lowry acid 
(it donates a proton to H2O), and H2O acts as a Brønsted–Lowry base (it accepts a proton 
from HCl). We see that the H2O molecule serves as a proton acceptor by using one of the 
nonbonding pairs of electrons on the O atom to “attach” the proton.
Because the emphasis in the Brønsted–Lowry concept is on proton transfer, the 
concept also applies to reactions that do
