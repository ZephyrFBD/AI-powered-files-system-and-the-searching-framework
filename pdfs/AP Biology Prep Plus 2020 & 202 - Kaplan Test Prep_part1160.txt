The experiment showed that there was some reduction in biomass, and
therefore in plant growth, in higher saline soils (had a higher electrical
conductivity). In order to strengthen this conclusion, the correct answer
must make a link between higher salinity and reduced plant growth and
development. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer, because it connects
high salinity (high EC) with a decrease in plant development (fewer beans
per plant). While (A) mentions a sensitivity of plants to salinity, it does not
actually say how the plants are more sensitive to salinity. (B) mentions
salinity, but not plant development. Finally, (C) connects higher salinity to
increased, rather than decreased, plant growth and development (taller
plants with more peas per pod).
41. C
Alkaline soil is basic (has a pH greater than 7.0), and only an acid would be
expected to be able to make the pH of the soil less basic. (C) is the correct
answer.
