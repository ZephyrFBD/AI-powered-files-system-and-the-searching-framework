Understanding how these molecules exert their effects and developing 
new molecules that can target disease and pain are enormous compo-
nents of the modern chemical enterprise. This chapter is about the mol-
ecules, composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, 
that bridge chemistry and biology.
More than 16 million carbon-containing compounds are known. 
Chemists make thousands of new compounds every year, about 90% 
of which contain carbon. The study of compounds whose molecules 
contain carbon constitutes the branch of chemistry known as organic 
chemistry. This term arose from the eighteenth-century belief that 
organic compounds could be formed only by living (that is, organic)

We are all familiar with how chemical 
substances can influence our health and behavior. 
Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, relieves 
aches and pains. The caffeine that is in coffee
