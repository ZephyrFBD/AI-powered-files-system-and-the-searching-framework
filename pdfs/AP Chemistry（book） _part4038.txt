Both resonance structures predict the same bond angles. (c) The two 
extreme Lewis structures predict different bond lengths. These bond 
length estimates assume that the structure minimizing formal charge 
makes a larger contribution to the true structure. C ¬ O, 1.28 Å; 
C “N, 1.33 Å; C ¬N, 1.43 Å; C ¬ H, 1.07 Å (d) The molecule will 
have a dipole moment. The C “N and C “O bond dipoles are oppo-
site each other, but they are not equal. And, there are nonbonding elec-
tron pairs that are not directly opposite each other and will not cancel.

10.1 It would be much easier to drink from a straw on Mars. When a straw 
is placed in a glass of liquid, the atmosphere exerts equal pressure inside 
and outside the straw. When we drink through a straw, we withdraw a
