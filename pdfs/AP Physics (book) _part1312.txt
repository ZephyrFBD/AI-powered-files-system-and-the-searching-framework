such as C, which is the same distance from each speaker, will experience a loud
sound because the interference will be constructive—two crests reach it at one
moment, two troughs reach it a moment later. On the other hand, at a point 
such as D in the diagram, little if any sound will be heard because destructive
interference occurs—compressions of one wave meet rarefactions of the other
and vice versa (see Fig. 11–38 and the related discussion on water waves in 
Section 11–11).
An analysis of this situation is perhaps clearer if we graphically represent 
the waveforms as in Fig. 12–17. In Fig. 12–17a it can be seen that at point C,
constructive interference occurs because both waves simultaneously have crests or
simultaneously have troughs when they arrive at C. In Fig. 12–17b we see that, to
reach point D, the wave from speaker B must travel a greater distance than the wave
from A. Thus the wave from B lags behind that from A. In this diagram, point E is
chosen so that the distanc
