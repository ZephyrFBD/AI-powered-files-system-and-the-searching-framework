e classified into three groups according to the number of sugar (or saccharide) molecules present:
1. A monosaccharide is the simplest kind of carbohydrate. It consists of a single sugar molecule, such as fructose or
glucose (Figure 2-5). (Note that the symbol C for carbon may be omitted in ring structures; a carbon exists wherever
four bond lines meet.) Sugar molecules have the formula (CH2O)n, where n is any number from 3 to 8. For glucose,
n is
6, and its formula is C6H12O6. The formula for fructose is also
C6H12O6, but as you can see in Figure 2-5, the placement of the carbon atoms is different. Two forms of glucose,
αglucose and βglucose, differ simply by a reversal of the H and OH on the first carbon (clockwise, after the
oxygen). As you will see below, even very small changes in the position of certain atoms may dramatically change
the chemistry of a molecule.

2. A disaccharide consists of two sugar molecules joined by a glycosidic linkage. During the process of joini
