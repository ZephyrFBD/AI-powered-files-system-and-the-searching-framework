th. This reaction is carried 
out under carefully controlled conditions to produce beer, wine, and other beverages in 
which ethanol (called just “alcohol” in everyday language) is the active ingredient.
The simplest polyhydroxyl alcohol (an alcohol containing more than one OH 
group) is 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol, HOCH2CH2OH), the major ingredient in 
automobile antifreeze. Another common polyhydroxyl alcohol is 1,2,3-propanetriol 
1glycerol, HOCH2CH1OH2CH2OH2, a viscous liquid that dissolves readily in water and is 
used in cosmetics as a skin softener and in foods and candies to keep them moist.
Phenol is the simplest compound with an OH group attached to an aromatic ring. 
One of the most striking effects of the aromatic group is the greatly increased acidity of 
the OH group. Phenol is about 1 million times more acidic in water than a nonaromatic 
alcohol. Even so, it is not a very strong acid 1Ka = 1.3 * 10-102. Phenol is used industri-
ally to make plastics and dyes, and as
