reintroduction of food, average brood sizes (average number of offspring per adult) were determined following 
either self-fertilization or mating with a well-fed male. The results are shown in Figure 1.

Individual C. elegans were held in ARD and subsequently 
allowed to reproduce either via self-fertilization (unshaded bars) 
or by mating with well-fed males (shaded bars). 
In a second experiment, individuals were held in ARD without food for 0–30 days and monitored for average 
survival times following reintroduction of food (Figure 2).
