researching ways to prevent and treat it. For example, researchers have been trying to find a way to get damaged cardiac
muscle to repair itself. A team of researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science recently discovered that activating a
protein called ERBB2 causes heart cells in adult mice to regenerate. The research team is continuing their research to
determine how this knowledge might be applied to human medicine. You can read more about this exciting research on the
