e two solutions are mixed in a constant-pressure 
calorimeter, a precipitate forms and the temperature of the 
mixture rises from 21.5 to 27.7 °C. (a) Before mixing, how 
many grams of Cu are present in the solution of CuSO4?  
(b) Predict the identity of the precipitate in the reaction. 
 
(c) Write complete and net ionic equations for the reaction 
that occurs when the two solutions are mixed. (d) From the 
calorimetric data, calculate ∆H for the reaction that occurs 
on mixing. Assume that the calorimeter absorbs only a neg-
ligible quantity of heat, that the total volume of the solution 
is 100.0 mL, and that the specific heat and density of the 
solution after mixing are the same as those of pure water.
 5.124 The precipitation reaction between AgNO31aq2 and NaCl1aq2 
proceeds as follows:
 
 
AgNO31aq2 + NaCl1aq2 ¡ NaNO31aq2 + AgCl1s2
 
 (a) By using data in Appendix C, calculate ∆H° for the net 
ionic equation of this reaction. (b) What would you expect 
for the value of ∆H° of t
