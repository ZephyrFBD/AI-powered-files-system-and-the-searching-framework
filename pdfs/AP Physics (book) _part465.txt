is the radius of its circular path. The time required 
for one complete orbit is the Moon’s period of 27.3 d. The speed of the Moon 
in its orbit about the Earth is
The period T in seconds is
Therefore,
We can write this acceleration in terms of
(the acceleration of
gravity at the Earth’s surface) as
NOTE The centripetal acceleration of the Moon,
is not
the acceleration of gravity for objects at the Moon’s surface due to the Moon’s
gravity. Rather, it is the acceleration due to the Earth’s gravity for any object
(such as the Moon) that is 384,000 km from the Earth. Notice how small this
acceleration is compared to the acceleration of objects near the Earth’s surface.
5–2 Dynamics of 
Uniform Circular Motion
According to Newton’s second law
an object that is accelerating 
must have a net force acting on it. An object moving in a circle, such as a ball on
the end of a string, must therefore have a force applied to it to keep it moving in
that circle. That is, a net force is necessary to
