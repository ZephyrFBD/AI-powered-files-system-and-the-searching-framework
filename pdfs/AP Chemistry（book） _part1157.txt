CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
Chapter Summary and Key Terms
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERIODIC TABLE (INTRODUCTION AND 
SECTION 7.1) The periodic table was first developed by Mendeleev 
and Meyer on the basis of the similarity in chemical and physical 
properties exhibited by certain elements. Moseley established that 
each element has a unique atomic number, which added more order 
to the periodic table.
We now know that elements in the same column of the periodic 
table have the same number of electron
