If you take a course in organic chemistry, you will see many examples of how elec-
tron delocalization influences the properties of organic molecules.

Sample Exercise 9.7 
Delocalized Bonding
Describe the bonding in the nitrate ion, NO3
-. Does this ion have delocalized p bonds?
SOLUTION
Analyze Given the chemical formula for a polyatomic anion, we 
are asked to describe the bonding and determine whether the ion 
has delocalized p bonds.
Plan Our first step is to draw Lewis structures. Multiple resonance 
structures involving the placement of the double bonds in differ-
ent locations would suggest that the p component of the double 
bonds is delocalized.
Solve In Section 8.6 we saw that NO3
- has three resonance st
