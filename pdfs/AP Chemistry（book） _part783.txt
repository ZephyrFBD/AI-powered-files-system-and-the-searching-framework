Our strategy for estimating reaction enthalpies is a straightforward application 
of Hess’s law. We use the fact that breaking bonds is always endothermic and forming 
bonds is always exothermic. We therefore imagine that the reaction occurs in two 
steps:
1. We supply enough energy to break those bonds in the reactants that are not present 
in the products. The enthalpy of the system is increased by the sum of the bond en-
thalpies of the bonds that are broken.
2. We form the bonds in the products that were not present in the reactants. This step 
releases energy and therefore lowers the enthalpy of the system by the sum of the 
bond enthalpies of the bonds that are formed.
The enthalpy of the reaction, ∆Hrxn, is estimated as the sum of the bond enthalpies of 
the bonds broken minus the sum of the bond enthalpies of the bonds formed:
 
∆Hrxn = g (bond enthalpies - g (bond enth
