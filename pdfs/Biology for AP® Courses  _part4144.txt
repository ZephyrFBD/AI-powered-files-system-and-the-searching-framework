a.
A cortical reaction would occur if multiple
sperm combine with an egg, resulting in a
genetically inviable embryo.
b.
The embryo would be genetically inviable and
would die in a few days. The zygote might have
multiple sets of chromosomes.
c.
The zygote might possess multiple sets of
chromosomes, which will result in a neural tube
defect in the developing fetus.
d.
The zygote would be viable, but the resulting
embryo would be genetically inviable.
56. After the blastula is formed, where do the embryonic
stem cells and germ layers originate?
a.
The inner cell mass contains embryonic stem
cells, which arrange themselves into the three
germ layers.
b.
The trophoblast in the blastula contains
embryonic stem cells, which arrange themselves
into three germ layers.
c.
The inner cell mass contains embryonic stem
cells, whereas the germ cells originate from the
trophoblast.
d.
The embryonic stem
