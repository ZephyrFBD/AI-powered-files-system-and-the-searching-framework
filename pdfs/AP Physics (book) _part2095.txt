ch RC circuits are
common in everyday life. They are used to control the speed of a car’s windshield
wipers and the timing of traffic lights; they are used in camera flashes, in heart
pacemakers, and in many other electronic devices. In RC circuits, we are not so
interested in the final “steady state”voltage and charge on the capacitor, but rather
in how these variables change in time.
A simple RC circuit is shown in Fig. 19–20a. When the switch S is closed,
current immediately begins to flow through the circuit. Electrons will flow out
from the negative terminal of the battery, through the resistor R, and accumulate
on the upper plate of the capacitor. And electrons will flow into the positive
terminal of the battery, leaving a positive charge on the other plate of the
capacitor. As charge accumulates on the capacitor, the potential difference
across it increases
and the current is reduced until eventually the
voltage across the capacitor equals the emf of the battery,
There is then n
