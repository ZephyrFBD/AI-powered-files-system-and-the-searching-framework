s or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Because electrolytes dissociate into their
component ions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure,
per mass than compounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.
Water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it

would be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special
mechanisms to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated
diffusion and active transport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport
requires energy in the form of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration
gradient.
