LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.L
Explain how cells obtain 
energy from biological 
macromolecules in order to 
power cellular functions.
ENE-1.L.5
When electrons are transferred between 
molecules in a sequence of reactions as they 
pass through the ETC, an electrochemical 
gradient of protons (hydrogen ions) across the 
inner mitochondrial membrane is established.
ENE-1.L.6
Fermentation allows glycolysis to proceed in 
the absence of oxygen and produces organic 
molecules, including alcohol and lactic acid, as 
waste products.
ENE-1.L.7
The conversion of ATP to ADP releases 
energy, which is used to power many 
metabolic processes.
