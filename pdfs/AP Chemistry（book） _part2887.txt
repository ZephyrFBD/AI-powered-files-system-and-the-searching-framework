e solid particles of CaSO3, as well as much of the unreacted SO2, can be removed from 
the furnace gas by passing it through an aqueous suspension of CaO (Figure 18.10). Not all 
the SO2 is removed, however, and given the enormous quantities of coal and oil burned 
worldwide, pollution by SO2 will probably remain a problem for some time.
