Give It Some Thought
Would you expect the ratio of atmospheric helium to argon to be larger in the 
troposphere or the mesosphere?
When applied to substances in aqueous solution, the concentration unit parts per 
 
million (ppm) refers to grams of substance per million grams of solution.

When dealing with gases, however,
