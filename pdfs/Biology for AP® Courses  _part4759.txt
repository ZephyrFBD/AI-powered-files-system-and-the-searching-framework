 the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (Figure 38.9) began storing seeds from around the world as a backup system
to the regional seed banks. If a regional seed bank stores varieties in Svalbard, losses can be replaced from Svalbard. The
seed vault is located deep into the rock of an arctic island. Conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal temperature
and humidity for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means that failure of the vault’s
systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is located on Spitsbergen island in Norway, which has an arctic climate. Why might
an arctic climate be good for seed storage?
a.
Such severe climatic conditions don’t let seeds dry out; they retain water and
