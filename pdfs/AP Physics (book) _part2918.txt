(b) How far does a muon travel in the
laboratory, on average, before decaying?
APPROACH If an observer were to move along with the muon (the muon would
be at rest to this observer), the muon would have a mean life of 
To
an observer in the lab, the muon lives longer because of time dilation. We find the
mean lifetime using Eq. 26–1 and the average distance using
SOLUTION (a) From Eq. 26–1 with
we have
(b) Relativity predicts that a muon with speed 
would travel an
average distance
and this
is the distance that is measured experimentally in the laboratory.
NOTE At a speed of 
classical physics would tell us that 
with a mean life of 
an average muon would travel 
This is shorter than the distance measured.
