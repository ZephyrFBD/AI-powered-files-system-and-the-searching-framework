ly phosphorylates and thus activates a cytoplasmic
protein kinase. In contrast, a G protein-coupled receptor is indirectly responsible for the phosphorylation event. For
a GPCR, phosphorylation of a protein kinase begins when the GPCR activates a membrane-bound G protein, which
in turn activates a second membrane-bound enzyme, which then can phosphorylate a protein kinase.
A Typical Answer to Long Question
Question 1
a. The binding of the specific ligand (signaling molecule) to the receptor protein triggers a conformational change in
the receptor, putting it in its activated state.
b. Your answer will vary, depending upon which receptor you choose to describe. See pages 76–81 in the text for the
step-by-step descriptions of the pathways.
c. Your answer will vary, depending upon which receptor you choose to describe. See pages 76–81 in the text.
Deactivation is the last step in the step-by-step descriptions of the pathways.
d. Your answer will vary, depending upon which receptor you cho
