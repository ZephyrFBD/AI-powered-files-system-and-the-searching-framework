 is positive (upward), whereas the acceleration is negative (down-
ward). (2) At the highest point (B in Fig. 2–23), the ball has zero velocity for
an instant. Is the acceleration also zero at this point? No. The velocity near
the top of the arc points upward, then becomes zero for an instant (zero time) at
the highest point, and then points downward. Gravity does not stop acting, so
even there. Thinking that
at point B would lead
to the conclusion that upon reaching point B, the ball would stay there: if the
acceleration (
of change of velocity) were zero, the velocity would stay
zero at the highest point, and the ball would stay up there without falling.
Remember: the acceleration of gravity always points down toward the Earth, even
when the object is moving up.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2;14
We did not consider the throwing action in these Examples. Why? Because during
the throw, the thrower’s hand is touching the ball and accelerating the ball at a
rate un
