reaction is very different. The anode consists of a metal alloy, typically 
with AM5 stoichiometry, where A is lanthanum (La) or a mixture of metals from the 
lanthanide series, and M is mostly nickel alloyed with smaller amounts of other tran-
sition metals. On charging, water is reduced at the anode to form hydroxide ions and 
hydrogen atoms that are absorbed into the AM5 alloy. When the battery is operating 
(discharging), the hydrogen atoms are oxidized and the resulting H+ ions react with 
OH- ions to form H2O.
Lithium-Ion Batteries
Currently, most portable electronic devices, including cell phones and laptop comput-
ers, are powered by rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Because lithium is a very 
light element, Li-ion batteries achieve a greater specific energy density—the amount of 
energy stored per unit mass—than nickel-based batteries. Because Li+ has a very large 
negative standard reduction potential (Table 20.1), Li-ion batteries produce a higher volt-
