According to quantum mechanics, we must describe the position 
of the electron in the hydrogen atom in terms of probabilities rath-
er than exact locations. The information about the probability is 
contained in the wave functions, c, obtained from Schrödinger’s 
equation. The square of the wave function, c2, called either the 
probability density or the electron density, as noted earlier, gives the 
probability that the electron is at any point in space. Because s orbit-
als are spherically s
