on with phosphoric acid 
yields Ca1H2PO422:
 
Ca31PO4221s2 + 4 H3PO41aq2 ¡ 3 Ca2+1aq2 + 6 H2PO4
-1aq2 
[22.49]
Although the solubility of Ca1H2PO422 allows it to be assimilated by plants, it also allows 
it to be washed from the soil and into bodies of water, thereby contributing to water pol-
lution.
