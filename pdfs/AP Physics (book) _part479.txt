SOLUTION In the vertical direction (y) there is no acceleration. Newton’s second
law tells us that the normal force 
on the car is equal to the weight mg since
the road is flat:
so
In the horizontal direction the only force is friction, and we must compare it to
the force needed to produce the centripetal acceleration to see if it is sufficient.
The net horizontal force required to keep the car moving in a circle around the
curve is
Now we compute the maximum total static friction force (the sum of the friction
forces acting on each of the four tires) to see if it can be large enough to provide
a safe centripetal acceleration. For (a),
and the maximum friction
force attainable (recall from Section 4–8 that
) is
Since a force of only 4500 N is needed, and that is, in fact, how much will be
exerted by the road as a static friction force, the car can follow the curve. But in
(b) the maximum static friction force possible is
The car will skid because the ground cannot exert suffic
