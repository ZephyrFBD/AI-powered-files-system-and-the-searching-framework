a.
Renin acts on angiotensin to directly stimulate
the release of aldosterone and ADH.
b.
Renin acts on angiotensin to form ACE and
angiotensin II, which then stimulates the release
of aldosterone and ADH.
c.
Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin,
which is then converted to angiotensin I by
ACE. Aldosterone and AD
