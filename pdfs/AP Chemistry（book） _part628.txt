ol Cl-. Using this information and the molar 
mass of Cl, we have:
 Grams Cl- = 12.02 * 10-3 mol Ag+2a 1 mol Cl-
1 mol Ag+ b a
35.5 g Cl-
mol Cl- b
 = 7.17 * 10-2 g Cl-
(b)  
Calculate the percentage of Cl– used in the sample.
Percent Cl- =
7.17 * 10-2 g
10.0 g
* 100% = 0.717% Cl-
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A mysterious white powder is found at a crime scene. A sim-
ple chemical analysis concludes that the powder is a mixture 
of sugar and morphine 1C17H19NO32, a weak base similar to 
ammonia. The crime lab takes 10.00 mg of the mysterious 
white powder, dissolves it in 100.00 mL water, and titrates it 
to the equivalence point with 2.84 mL of a standard 0.0100 
M HCl solution. What is the percentage of morphine in the 
white powder?  
(a) 8.10%  
(b) 17.3%  
(c) 32.6%  
(d) 49.7%  
(e) 81.0%

A sample of an iron ore is dissolved in acid, and the iron is 
converted to Fe2+. The sample is then titrated with 47.20 mL
