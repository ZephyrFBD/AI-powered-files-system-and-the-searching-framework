e are varying degrees of resistance to ampicillin in the bacteria
population.
(b) The controls are plates 3 and 5 (the plates without ampicillin). The independent variable is the concentration
of ampicillin on each plate.
(c) Plates 3 and 5 will have many bacteria, perhaps a solid “lawn” of bacteria on each of those plates. Plates 2
and 4 will have very few bacteria growing on them.
(d) Since the starter plate did not contain ampicillin, there was no selection for ampicillin resistance on that
plate, and so the majority of the bacteria on the starter plate are expected to not have resistance to
ampicillin. Therefore, very few bacteria are expected to grow on plates 2 and 4, which contain ampicillin.
Many more bacteria will grow on plates 3 and 5 since those plates do not contain ampicillin.

13. (a) This is an example of directional selection because in the presence of the predator C. alta, the mean number
of spots per male guppy decreases.
