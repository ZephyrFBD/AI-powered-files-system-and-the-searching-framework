genic virus is called
transduction.
Viruses that infect animals do not have to break their way out of the cell the same way that a bacteriophage does.
Since animals cells don’t have a cell wall, viruses often just “bud” out of the membrane in a process similar to
exocytosis. When a virus does this, it becomes enveloped by a chunk of host cell membrane that it takes with it.
Viruses with a lipid envelope are called enveloped viruses.
Retroviruses like HIV are RNA viruses that use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA
genomes into DNA so that they can be inserted into a host genome. RNA viruses have extremely high rates of
mutation because they lack proofreading mechanisms when they replicate their genomes. This high rate of mutation
will create lots of variety, which makes these viruses difficult to treat. They evolve quickly, as drug-resistant
mutations become naturally selected. New drugs must constantly be identified to treat the resistance.
Viruses can sometime
