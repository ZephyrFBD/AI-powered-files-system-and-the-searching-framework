y of a population is the total number of individuals per area
 
or volume occupied. There may be 100 buffalo/km2 or 100 mosquitos/m3.
3. Dispersion describes how individuals in a population are distributed. They may be clumped (like humans in
cities), uniform (like trees in an orchard), or random (like trees in a forest).
4. Age structure is a description of the abundance of individuals of each age. It is often graphically expressed in an
age structure diagram (Figure 16-1). Horizontal bars or tiers of the diagram represent the frequency of individuals in
a particular age group. A vertical line down the center of each tier divides each age group into males and females. A
rapidly growing population is indicated when a large proportion of the population is young. Therefore, age structure
diagrams that are pyramidshaped, with tiers larger at the base and narrower at the top, indicate rapidly growing
populations. In contrast, age structure diagrams with tiers of equal width represent popul
