▲ Figure 8.10 Dipole and dipole moment. 
When charges of equal magnitude and 
opposite sign Q+ and Q- are separated by 
a distance r, a dipole is produced.

If the charged particles are moved 
closer together, does m increase, 
decrease, or stay the same?
Give It Some Thought
Chlorine monofluoride, ClF, and iodine monofluoride, IF, are interhalogen 
compounds—compounds that contain bonds between different halogen elements. 
Which of these molecules has the larger dipole moment?
Dipole moments are experimentally measurable and are usually reported in debyes (D), 
a unit that equals 3.34 * 10-30 coulomb-meters (C-m). For molecules, we usually measure 
charge in units of the electronic charge e, 1.60 * 10-19 C, and distance in angstroms. 
This means we need to convert units whenever we want to report a dipole moment in 
debyes. Suppose that two charges 1+ and 1- (in units of e) are separated by 1.00 Å. The 
dipole moment produced is
m = Qr = 11.60 * 10-19 C
