r reasoning. Before 
taking any measurements, think about the input and output of energy in a plant. For 
instance, what do you predict about the quantity of energy the plants take in compared 
to the quantity of energy that goes out? What do you think are various ways that a plant 
(or a number of plants) could lose energy, and how could you estimate the amount of 
energy lost through these various pathways? Enter your predictions in your lab notebook 
by constructing an annotated system diagram, such as Figure 2, of the flow of energy 
into and out of a plant.

Step 2 Your energy diagram will help you and your lab team design a data collection 
procedure that helps you measure energy capture and flow in a plant. As a team, design 
your investigation to sample the biomass of an adequate number of plants early in the 
life cycle and then again later in the life cycle. Remember, biomass is only the mass
