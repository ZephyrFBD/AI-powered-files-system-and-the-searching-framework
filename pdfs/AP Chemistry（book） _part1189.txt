are nonmetals, elements that do not form ions are metal-
loids.‚Äù Do you agree or disagree?
 7.59  Predict whether each of the following oxides is ionic or 
molecular: SnO2, Al2O3, CO2, Li2O, Fe2O3, H2O.
 7.60  Some metal oxides, such as Sc2O3, do not react with pure 
water, but they do react when the solution becomes either 
acidic or basic. Do you expect Sc2O3 to react when the solu-
tion becomes acidic or when it becomes basic? Write a bal-
anced chemical equation to support your answer.
 7.61  Would you expect manganese(II) oxide, MnO, to react more 
readily with HCl(aq) or NaOH(aq)?
 7.62  Arrange the following oxides in order of increasing acidity: 
CO2, CaO, Al2O3, SO3, SiO2, P2O5.
 7.63  Chlorine reacts with oxygen to form Cl2O7. (a) What is the 
name of this product (see Table 2.6)? (b) Write a balanced 
equation for the formation of Cl2O71l2 from the elements. 
(c) Would you expect Cl2O7 to be more reactive toward 
H+1aq2 or OH-1aq2? (d) If the oxygen in Cl2O7 is considered
