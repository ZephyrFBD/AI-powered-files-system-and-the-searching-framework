sed now, the 
development of DDT resistance in mosquito 
populations occurs in months rather than years. 
Which of the following best explains the 
observations concerning DDT resistance in 
mosquitoes? 
(A) Competition for limited resources causes 
mosquitoes to migrate to geographical areas 
that have richer supplies of DDT. 
(B) The proportion of DDT-resistant mosquitoes 
in a population remains constant due to the 
metabolic costs of DDT utilization. 
(C) Natural selection favors DDT-resistant 
mosquitoes that are already present in a 
population when DDT exposure occurs. 
(D) DDT is a chemical signal that delays normal 
reproductive cycles in many mosquito 
populations. 
  
 
 
 
28. Two nutrient solutions are maintained at the same 
pH. Actively respiring mitochondria are isolated 
and placed into each of the two solutions. Oxygen 
gas is bubbled into one solution. The other 
solution is depleted of available oxygen. Which of 
the following best explains why ATP production
