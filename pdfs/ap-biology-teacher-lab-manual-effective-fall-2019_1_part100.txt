he same even though which 
components are next to each other can vary greatly depending upon which nodes we 
swivel. On the other hand, we can change the topology by simply switching which 
pendant from which we hang a particular animal. 
The use of statistics is widespread in biology. Some examples include (1) examining 
whether the heights or weights of individuals are normally distributed, (2) testing with 
a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test whether the results of a dihybrid testcross fit a ratio 
such as 1:1:1:1, (3) using a studentâ€™s T-test to see whether two distributions are different 
from one another, (4) testing whether bird nests are randomly distributed spatially in 
a prairie or woods, and (5) visually testing the correlation of two variables with linear 
regression to infer whether a causal relationship might exist (with all of the precautions 
of not confusing correlation and causation). Your students will employ some of these 
uses of statistics in Investigation 2: Math
