ulfide sublimes readily, even below its melting 
point of 320 Â°C. The molecules of the vapor phase are found 
to effuse through a tiny hole at 0.28 times the rate of effu-
sion of Ar atoms under the same conditions of temperature 
and pressure. What is the molecular formula of arsenic(III) 
sulfide in the gas phase?
 
10.88  A gas of unknown molecular mass was allowed to effuse 
through a small opening under constant-pressure condi-
tions. It required 105 s for 1.0 L of the gas to effuse. Under 
identical experimental conditions it required 31 s for 1.0 L 
of O2 gas to effuse. Calculate the molar mass of the 
unknown gas. (Remember that the faster the rate of effu-
sion, the shorter the time required for effusion of 1.0 L; in 
other words, rate is the amount that diffuses over the time 
it takes to diffuse.)

viate from ideal behavior. (b) List two reasons why the gases 
deviate from
