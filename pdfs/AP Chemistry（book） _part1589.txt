n its 
name, its pressure, and its temperature. From the name, we can 
write the chemical formula of the substance and determine its 
molar mass.
Plan We can use Equation 10.10 to calculate the density. Before we 
can do that, however, we must convert the given quantities to the 
appropriate units, degrees Celsius to kelvins and pressure to atmo-
spheres. We must also calculate the molar mass of CCl4.
Solve The absolute temperature is 125 + 273 = 398 K. The pressure 
is 1714 torr2 11 atm>760 torr2 = 0.939 atm. The molar mass of 
CCl4 is 12.01 + 142 135.452 = 153.8 g>mol. Therefore,
d = Pℳ
RT =
10.939 atm21153.8 g>mol2
10.08206 L@atm>mol@K21398 K2 = 4.42 g>L
Check If we divide molar mass 1g>mol2 by density 1g>L2, we end 
up with L/mol. The numerical value is roughly 154>4.4 = 35, 
which is in the right ballpark for the molar volume of a gas heated 
to 125 °C at near atmospheric pressure. We may thus conclude our 
answer is reasonable.
