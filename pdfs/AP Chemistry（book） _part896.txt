Sample Exercise 6.3 
Energy of a Photon
Calculate the energy of one photon of yellow light that has a wavelength of 589 nm.
SOLUTION
Analyze Our task is to calculate the energy, E, of a photon, given its 
wavelength, l = 589 nm.
Plan We can use Equation 6.1 to convert the wavelength to 
frequency:  n = c>l. We can then use Equation 6.3 to calculate 
energy: E = hn
Comment  If one photon of radiant energy supplies 3.37 * 10 - 19 J, 
we calculate that one mole of these photons will supply:
16.02 * 1023 photons>mol213.37 * 10 - 19 J>photon2
 = 2.03 * 105 J>mol

▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) A laser emits light that has a frequency of 4.69 * 1014 s - 1. 
What is the energy of one  
photon of this radiation? (b) If 
the laser emits
