 and chlorine, have seven
electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them
negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons
in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus, the columns
of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elementsâ€™ outer electron shells that is responsible for their
similar chemical characteristics.
Electron Orbitals
Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does
not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus. They do not circle the nucleus like
the earth orbits the sun, but are found in electron orbitals. These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that
electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. M
