ic homeostasis are maintained by the constant
movement of molecules across membranes.

2.B.3. Eukaryotic cells maintain internal membranes that partition the cell
into specialized regions.

Enduring understanding 2.C. Organisms use feedback mechanisms to
regulate growth and reproduction, and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
Chapter/Key Concepts
2.C.1. Organisms use feedback mechanisms to maintain their internal
environments and respond to external environmental changes.

Enduring understanding 2.D. Growth and dynamic homeostasis of a
biological system are influenced by changes in the system's environment.
Chapter/Key Concepts
2.D.1. All biological systems from cells and organisms to populations,
communities and ecosystems are affected by complex biotic and ab
