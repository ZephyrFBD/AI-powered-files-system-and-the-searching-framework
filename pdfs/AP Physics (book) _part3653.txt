14. (I) Estimate the range of the strong force if the mediating
particle were the kaon instead of a pion.
15. (I) How much energy is required to produce a neutron–
antineutron pair?
16. (II) Determine the total energy released when 
decays
to 
and then to a proton.
17. (II) Two protons are heading toward each other with equal
speeds. What minimum kinetic energy must each have if a
meson is to be created in the process? (See Table 32–2.)
18. (II) What minimum kinetic energy must a proton and an
antiproton each have if they are traveling at the same
speed toward each other, collide, and produce a 
pair
in addition to themselves? (See Table 32–2.)
19. (II) What are the wavelengths of the two photons produced
when a proton and antiproton at rest annihil
