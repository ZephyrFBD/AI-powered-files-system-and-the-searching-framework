it:
Gross primary productivity is the energy producers incorporate from the sun.
The ecosystem with the highest gross primary productivity is tropical
rainforest, which (according to the table) has the highest amount of energy at
trophic level D (17,450 kJ/m2). High precipitation in the tropical rainforest
increases the rate of photosynthesis, which converts light energy to chemical
energy, as a result of the photolysis of water during non-cyclic
photophosphorylation.
(b) Based on the amount of energy at the trophic levels in the data table,
construct a food chain in the template. Write the letter of the trophic level
in the appropriate box and draw arrows to indicate the energy flow
between levels. Provide two reasons for your answer. (4 points
