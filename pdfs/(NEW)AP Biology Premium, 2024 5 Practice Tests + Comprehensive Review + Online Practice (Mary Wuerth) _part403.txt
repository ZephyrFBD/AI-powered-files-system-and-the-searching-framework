essor protein, so choice (C) is incorrect.
2. (A) In inducible operons, the inducer molecule binds to the repressor protein, which prevents the repressor
protein from binding to the operator, increasing the level of expression of the operon. Choice (B) is incorrect
because inducible operons are usually catabolic, not anabolic, and would not be involved in the production of
arabinose. The presence of the inducer does not affect the production of the repressor protein, so choice (C) is
incorrect. The presence of the inducer results in decreased binding of the repressor protein to the operator, so
choice (D) is also incorrect.
3. (A) The operators and promoters of operons both serve as noncoding sequences to which regulatory proteins
bind. Repressor proteins bind to the operator, and RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. Genes for both
regulatory proteins and structural proteins contain sequences that code for proteins, so choices (B), (C), and (D)
are incorrect.
4. (C) In inducible opero
