cussed in later Chapters. In this Chapter we discuss only charges at rest, the study
of which is called electrostatics, and Coulomb’s law gives the electrostatic force.
When calculating with Coulomb’s law, we usually use magnitudes, ignoring
signs of the charges, and determine the direction of a force separately based on
whether the force is attractive or repulsive.

EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 443, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Electric force on electron by proton. Determine the
magnitude and direction of the electric force on the electron of a hydrogen 
atom exerted by the single proton  
that is the atom’s nucleus. Assume
the average distance between the revolving electron and the proton is
Fig. 16–16.
APPROACH To find the force magnitude we use Coulomb’s law,
(Eq. 16–1), with  
The electron and proton
have the same magnitude of charge, e, so  
SOLUTION The magnitude of the force
