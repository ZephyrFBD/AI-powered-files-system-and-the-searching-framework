 passes through two capillary beds, the glomerulus and the capillary network
surrounding the tubule.
3. Collecting duct. The distal convoluted tube empties into the collecting duct, which descends in the same
direction as the descending limb toward the center of the kidney. A single collecting duct is shared by numerous
nephrons and empties into the renal pelvis, which, in turn, drains into the ureter.
The operation of the human nephron consists of three processes, as follows:

The operation of the human nephron consists of three processes, as follows:
1. Filtration. When blood enters the glomerulus, pressure forces water and solutes through the capillary walls into
the Bowman’s capsule. Solutes include glucose, salts, vitamins, nitrogen wastes, and any other substances small
enough to pass through the capillary walls. Larger substances, such as red blood cells and proteins, remain in the
capillaries. The material that enters the Bowman’s capsule, or filtrate, flows into th
