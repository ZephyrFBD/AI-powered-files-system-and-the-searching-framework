the brain involved in maintaining homeostasis) initiates the response by secreting
gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH, in turn, stimulates the anterior pituitary to release follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). As part of the ovarian cycle, FSH stimulates the
development of the egg within the follicle (completing meiosis I) and also stimulates the follicle to produce
estrogen. In a positive feedback reaction to rising estrogen levels, the anterior pituitary secretes additional LH (after
stimulation by the hypothalamus). This spike of LH in the middle of the cycle causes ovulation, the release of the
egg (actually the secondary oocyte) from the follicle. After ovulation, the follicle, now called the corpus luteum,
continues to produce estrogen and progesterone. These hormones regulate the menstrual cycle by stimulating the
thickening of the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus). In response to continued high levels of progesterone,
a negative f
