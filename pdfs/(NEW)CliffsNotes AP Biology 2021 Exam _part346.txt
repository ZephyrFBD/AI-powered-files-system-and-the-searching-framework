each cell bearing one chromosome. The spindle apparatus, microtubules, and centrioles found in eukaryotic cell
divisions are lacking, since in prokaryotes, there is no nucleus to divide.
Prokaryotes may also contain plasmids, short, circular dsDNA molecules outside the chromosome. Plasmids carry
genes that are beneficial but not normally essential to the survival of the prokaryote. A group of plasmids, called R
plasmids, provide bacteria with resistance against antibiotics. Plasmids replicate independently of the chromosome.
Some plasmids, called episomes, can become incorporated into the prokaryotic chromosome.
DNA replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is basically the same. But because prokaryotic
chromosomes are circular, replication begins at a single, unique origin, progressing in both directions until they meet
at the termination site. In contrast, eukaryotes, with much larger chromosomes, have multiple points of origin. Also,
prokaryotes do not have the eukaryotic
