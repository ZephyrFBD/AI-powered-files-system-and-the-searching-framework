amino acid-derived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal
glands, and thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland. The pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin
which regulates sleep cycles.

Figure 28.3 (a) The hormone epinephrine, which triggers the fight-or-flight response, is derived from the amino acid
tyrosine. (b) The hormone melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms, is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.
Peptide Hormones
The structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain (chain of amino acids). The peptide hormones include
molecules that are short polypeptide chains, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released
into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland. This class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by
the pituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone
