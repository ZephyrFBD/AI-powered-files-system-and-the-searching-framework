messenger molecules that travel in the bloodstream to affect a target cell. Different regions of the nephron have specialized
cells with receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones. Table 32.1 summarizes the hormones that control the
osmoregulatory functions. For example, the flight/flight hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, released by the adrenal
medulla and nervous subsystem, respectively, halt kidney function temporarily when the body is under extreme stress and
much of the body’s energy is used to combat imminent danger. Another example is the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system that increases blood pressure and volume primarily by constricting blood vessels. Another hormone, antidiuretic
hormone (ADH) increases membrane permeability to water in the collecting ducts of the nephron by adding aquaporins,
causing more water to be reabsorbed. You’ve experienced the effects of ADH when it’s hot outside and you’re running
around the athletic field; since you’re losi
