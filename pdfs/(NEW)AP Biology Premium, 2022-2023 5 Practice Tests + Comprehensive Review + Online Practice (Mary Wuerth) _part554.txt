of the reduction of one trophic level in
a food web. For example, the decline of sea otter populations on the Pacific Coast led to increases in the sea
urchin populations. Sea otters eat sea urchins. Without the presence of sea otters, the sea urchin populations
exploded. Sea urchins eat kelp, and the increase in the numbers of sea urchins led to a decrease in kelp
forests. Declines in kelp forests led to decreased habitats for other marine organisms in the area. Changes in
just one level of the food chain (the number of sea otters) had cascading effects throughout the food web.
■Parasitism: This is a symbiotic relationship where one species benefits from the relationship but the other
species is harmed. Fleas that live on dogs or cats are parasites. The fleas benefit from consuming the blood of
the host animal, and the dog or cat on which the flea lives is harmed.
■Commensalism: In commensalism, one species benefits and the other neither benefits nor is harmed. Cattle
egrets are birds
