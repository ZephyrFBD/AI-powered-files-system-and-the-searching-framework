r
complex affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system?
a.
Aldosterone will not be produced, decreasing
blood volume
b.
Angiotensin I will not be produced, decreasing
blood pressure
c.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme will not be
produced, increasing sodium reabsorption.
d.
Angiotensin II will not be produced, increasing
the glomerular filtration rate.
64. The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lowers blood
pressure by acting as a vasodilator. It is released by cells in
the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure
and in patients with sleep apnea. ANP prevents sodium
reabsorption by the renal tubules. Therefore, what
excretory system symptom might someone with sleep
apnea also experience and why?
a.
reduction in urination due to reduction of water
reabsorption in the kidneys
b.
excessive sodium reabsorption by renal tubes
due to increase in water reabsorption in the
kidneys
c.
excessive sodium reabsorption by renal tubes
due to reduction of water reabsorption in the
kidneys
