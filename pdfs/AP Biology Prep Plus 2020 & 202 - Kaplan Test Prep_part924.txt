Figure 1. Immune System Response
FigureÂ 2. Immunological Memory
1. The mammalian immune system consists of innate immunity and
adaptive immunity (Figure 1). Innate immunity involves
nonspecific defense mechanisms such as physical and chemical
barriers that respond to antigen (bacteria or virus) exposure.
Adaptive immunity involves antigen-specific immune response
and occurs if the innate immune system is unsuccessful in
destroying the antigen. The adaptive immune system has the
unique ability to remember an encounter with an antigen. Upon a
subsequent encounter with the same antigen, immunological
memory allows the immune system to mount a response that is
faster and greater (Figure 2). Artificially acquired immunity can be
induced by vaccination.
