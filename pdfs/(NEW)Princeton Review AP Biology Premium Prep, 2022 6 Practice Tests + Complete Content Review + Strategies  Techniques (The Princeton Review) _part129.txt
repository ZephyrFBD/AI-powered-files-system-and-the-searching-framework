of an enzyme.
Let’s set up a graph that shows the results of an experiment examining the relationship between pH and enzyme
activity. Notice that we’ve chosen only one factor here, pH. We could have chosen any of the three. Why did we
choose pH and not temperature or substrate concentration? Well, perhaps it’s the one we know the most about.
What is the independent variable? It is pH. In other words, pH is being manipulated in the experiment. We’ll
therefore label the x-axis with pH values from 0 through 14.
What is the dependent variable? It’s the enzyme activity—the thing that’s affected by pH. Let’s label the y-axis
“Rate of Reaction.” Now we’re ready to plot the values on the graph. Based on our knowledge of enzymes, we know
that for most enzymes the functional range of pH is narrow, with optimal performance occurring at or around a pH
of 7.
Now you should interpret your graph. If the pH level decreases from a neutral pH of 7, the reaction rate of the
enzyme will decrease. If the p
