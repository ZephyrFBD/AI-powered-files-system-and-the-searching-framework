low Between Producers and Consumers
Energy flow through a system is evaluated by allowing larvae of cabbage white butterflies to feed on Brussels
sprouts, a close relative to Wisconsin Fast Plants (both are in the genus Brassica). To follow energy flow, make
regular measurements of Brussels sprouts and larval masses. Dry larval masses can be approximated by multiplying
live mass by 40%, but a more accurate conversion can be determined by sacrificing a group of larvae, drying and
weighing them. Dry larval mass can be converted to kcal by multiplying the mass by 5.5 kcal/g.
To follow the energy flow, account for mass changes in the Brussels sprouts and butterfly larvae and in the mass of
fecal matter (frass) produced by the larvae.
Part III: Investigating Additional Energy Flow Questions
The final exercise in this investigation is to design your own experiment. Consider the relationship between the
survival and reproductive strategies of a plant and how it allocates energy to plant defen
