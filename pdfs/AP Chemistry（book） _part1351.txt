molecule using bonds and 
electron pairs as needed. (b) Are there any resonance struc-
tures for the molecule? If so, sketch them. (c) Are the reso-
nance structures in (a) and (b) equivalent to one another as 
they are in benzene?
(a) 
(b) 
(c)

 8.95 Consider the hypothetical molecule B¬A “ B. Are the fol-
lowing statements true or false? (a) This molecule cannot ex-
ist. (b) If resonance was important, the molecule would have 
identical A–B bond lengths.
 8.96 An important reaction for the conversion of natural gas to 
other useful hydrocarbons is the conversion of methane to 
ethane.
 
 
2 CH41g2 ¡ C2H61g2 + H21g2
 
 In practice, this reaction is carried out in the presence of oxygen, 
which converts the hydrogen produced into water.
 
 
2 CH41g2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡ C2H61g2 + H2O1g2
 
 Use Table 8.3 to estimate ∆H for these two reactions. Why is 
the conversion of methane to ethane more favorable when 
oxygen is used?
