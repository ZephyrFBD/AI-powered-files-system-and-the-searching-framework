Homeostasis is the process by which a stable internal
environment is maintained within an organism. Our primary
homeostatic organs are the kidneys, liver, large intestine, and
skin.
1.
There are three laws of thermodynamics. Together they discuss
the conservation of energy, entropy, and absolute zero.
2.
Bioenergetics, or biological thermodynamics, studies how
chemical energy is broken down and converted to usable
energy within the biological system. This can be at the
ecosystem, organismal, or cellular level.
3.
Chemiosmosis produces energy from the movement of H+ ions
across a membrane down a concentration gradient in both
photosynthesis and respiration. Catabolism is the breaking
down of complex substances into simple substances, making
energy available in the process.

Thermoregulation refers to the physiological processes that
come together to maintain a stable bod
