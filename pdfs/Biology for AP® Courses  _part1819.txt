he cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is
transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it
resides there before being degraded, called RNA stability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of protein that
is synthesized. The RNA stability can be increased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased,
leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis. RNA stability is controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) and
microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and miRNAs bind to the 5' UTR or the 3' UTR of the RNA to increase or decrease
RNA stability. Depending on the RBP, the stability can be increased or decreased significantly; however, miRNAs always
decrease stability and promote decay.
16.6 Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene Regulation
Changing the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein, the function of the protein, or how
long it is found in the c
