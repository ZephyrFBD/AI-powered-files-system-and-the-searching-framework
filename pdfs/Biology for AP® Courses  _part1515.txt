, and are found in association with
scaffold proteins.
In interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged
region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains
genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains
genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.

14.3 | Basics of DNA Replication
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How does the structure of DNA provide for the process of replication?
•
How did the Meselson and Stahl experiments support the semi-conservative nature of replication?
