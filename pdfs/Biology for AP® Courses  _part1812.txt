ng on or turning off of a gene
molecule that is left after the energy is used to start translation
energy-providing molecule that binds to eIF-2 and is needed for translation
epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing; commonly found in cancer cells.
operon that can be activated or repressed depending on cellular needs and the surrounding
environment
protein complex containing eIF2-2 that starts translation
operon in prokaryotic cells that encodes genes required for processing and intake of lactose
second, larger ribosomal subunit that binds to the RNA to translate it into protein
small RNA molecules (approximately 21 nucleotides in length) that bind to RNA molecules to
degrade them
oncogene that causes cancer in many cancer cells
protein that prevents transcription
region of DNA outside of the promoter region that binds activators or repressors that control gene expression in
prokaryotic cells
collection of genes involved in a pathway that are transcribed together as a singl
