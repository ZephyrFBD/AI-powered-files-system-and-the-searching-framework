FIGURE 5;36 MisConceptual Question 6.
13. Does an apple exert a gravitational force on the Earth? If
so, how large a force? Consider an apple (a) attached to a
tree and (b) falling.
14. Why is more fuel required for a spacecraft to travel from the
Earth to the Moon than to return from the Moon to the Earth?
15. Would it require less speed to launch a satellite (a) toward
the east or (b) toward the west? Consider the Earth’s rota-
tion direction and explain your choice.
16. An antenna loosens and becomes detached from a satellite
in a circular orbit around the Earth. Describe the antenna’s
subsequent motion. If it will land on the Earth, describe where;
if not, describe how it could be made to land on the Earth.
17. The Sun is below us at midnight, nearly in line with the
Earth’s center. Are we then heavier at midnight, due to the
Sun’s gravitational force on us, than we are at noon? Explain.
18. When will your apparent weight be the greatest, as meas-
ured by a scale in a mo
