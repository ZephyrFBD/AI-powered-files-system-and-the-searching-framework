Speaker wires. Suppose you want to connect your stereo to
remote speakers (Fig. 18–14). (a) If each wire must be 20 m long, what diameter
copper wire should you use to keep the resistance less than 
per wire?
(b) If the current to each speaker is 4.0 A, what is the potential difference, or
voltage drop, across each wire?
APPROACH We solve Eq. 18–3 to get the area A, from which we can calculate
the wire’s radius using 
The diameter is 2r. In (b) we can use Ohm’s
law,
SOLUTION (a) We solve Eq. 18–3 for the area A and find 
for copper in 
Table 18–1:
The cross-sectional area A of a circular wire is 
The radius must then
be at least
The diameter is twice the radius and so must be at least 
(b) From
we find that the voltage drop
