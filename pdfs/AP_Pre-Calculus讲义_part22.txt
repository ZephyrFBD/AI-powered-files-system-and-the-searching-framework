The domain and range of a function y = f(x) can be obtained from a graph of f as shown 
in the figure. The domain is the set of all x-values for which f is defined, and the range is all 
the corresponding y-values.

1.2.2 Increasing and Decreasing Functions 
The graph shown in the figure rises, falls, then rises again as we move from left to right: It 
rises from A to B, falls from B to C, and rises again from C to D. 
 
We can see from the graph above that f is increasing on (a, b) and (c, d). f is decreasing 
on (b, c).

f is increasing on an interval I if f(x1) < f(x2) whenever x1 < x2 in I.  
f is decreasing on an interval I if f(x1) > f(x2) whenever x1 < x2 in I.
