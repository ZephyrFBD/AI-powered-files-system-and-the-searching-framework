length by noting that

h is the height of the object and we assume the angles are small so

the image will be at infinity and the object will be precisely at the focal point;
see Fig. 25–18. Then

We see that the shorter the focal length of the lens, the greater the magnification.†

FIGURE 25–16 When the same object
is viewed at a shorter distance, the
image on the retina is greater, so the
object appears larger and more detail
can be seen. The angle that the object
subtends in (a) is greater than in (b).
