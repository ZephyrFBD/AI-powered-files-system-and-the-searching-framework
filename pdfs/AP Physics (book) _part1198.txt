 amplitude (Eq. 11–15), the amplitude A must
decrease as 1/r so that
will be proportional to 
(as in Eq. 11–16b).
Hence
If we consider again two distances from the source,
and 
then
[spherical wave]
When the wave is twice as far from the source, the amplitude is half as large, and
so on (ignoring damping due to friction).
