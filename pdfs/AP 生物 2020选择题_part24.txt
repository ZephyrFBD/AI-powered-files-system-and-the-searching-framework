19. A particular genetic disorder results from a
single change in the amino acid sequence coded
for in a gene. Parts of the sequence in normal
and mutated genes are shown below.
Normal: 
TAC CTC GTG GAC TGA GGT CTC 
Mutated: 
TAC CTC GTG GAC TGA GGT CAC 
Based on the codon chart above, which of the 
following amino acid changes is most likely 
found in the mutated protein?

20. Figure 1 shows the inheritance of a particular 
genetic condition in three generations of one 
family. Which of the following best explains the 
observed pattern of inheritance? 
(A) The condition is passed randomly because 
of the independent assortment of 
chromosomes. 
(B) The condition is passed from fathers to 
sons via a Y-linked gen
