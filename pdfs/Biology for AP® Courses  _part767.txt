(a) Construct a graph of ln(rate) versus 1/T(K) and
determine the energy of activation for the uncatalyzed
reaction.
(b) Based on the data, explain the importance of enzymes
for time scales characteristic of living systems on
Earth—that is to say, life as we know it.
The time scale required for half of the molecules of initial
sucrose to remain can be estimated. The relationship
between the half-life and the activation energy is:
t1 / 2 = 0.69×10
EA/ 2.3RT
At a temperature of 300K, approximately room
temperature, RT is equal to 2,494 J/mole.

processes. For each process, explain an expected outcome
and describe an example of a specific exercise that can
lead to the expected outcome.
