other organisms that could
cause damage. The second line of defense involves several nonspecific mechanisms, as follows:
1. Phagocytes are white blood cells (leukocytes) that engulf pathogens by phagocytosis. They include neutrophils
and monocytes. Monocytes enlarge into large phagocytic cells called macrophages. Other white blood cells called
natural killer cells (NK cells) attack abnormal body cells (such as tumors) or pathogen-infected body cells.
2. Complement (also called the complement system) is a group of about 20 proteins that “complement” defense
reactions. These proteins help attract phagocytes to foreign cells and help destroy foreign cells by promoting cell
lysis (breaking open the cell).
3. Interferons are substances secreted by cells invaded by viruses that stimulate neighboring cells to produce
proteins that help them defend against the viruses.
4. The inflammatory response is a series of nonspecific events that occur in response to pathogens. When skin is
damaged, for
