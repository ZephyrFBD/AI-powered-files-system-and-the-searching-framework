lex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the
spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).
In the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. Because the spinal cord is the information
superhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. The extent of the
paralysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed.
For example, if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas
damage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs. Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to
treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to
act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves. Researchers are also look
