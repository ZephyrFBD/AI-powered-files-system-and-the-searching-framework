FtsZ is a prokaryotic protein and tubulin is a eukaryotic protein. These two proteins share many structural and
functional similarities and are believed to have evolved from the same ancestral protein. However, there are also some
important differences between these proteins. In what way are these proteins different?
a.
Tubulin proteins can rapidly disassemble, but FtsZ proteins cannot.

b.
Tubulin proteins can form long filaments, but FtsZ proteins cannot.
c.
Tubulin uses GTP as an energy source, but FtsZ does not.
d.
Tubulin pulls chromosomes apart, but FtsZ does not.
