the three children was compared with the boy’s DNA. He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother

Forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological
samples. They analyze the DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database
of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis;
most forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat
(STR) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment. Only mitochondrial
DNA is sequenced for forensics. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present
their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs o
