Here is one possible response that would earn full credit:
According to the data, at each temperature, oxygen consumption for the
germinating corn seeds is higher than that for the non-germinating corn
seeds. Germinating corn seeds require more energy than non-germinating
corn seeds, so the rate of cellular respiration would be greater. Thus,
oxygen consumption, which indicates the rate of cellular respiration, is
greater for germinating corn seeds. Compared to seeds at 10°C, seeds at
25°C have higher oxygen consumption (higher rate of cellular respiration).
As temperature increases, cellular respiration increases. Oxygen
consumption for germinating corn seeds at 20°C for 20 min would be
approximately 1.4 mL.
Oxygen consumption is
higher in germinating
corn seeds because
germinating seeds have
higher energy needs and
thus highe
