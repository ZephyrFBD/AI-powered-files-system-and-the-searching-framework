a
special colony of bacteria that lives inside each one of us. It helps us with some digestion and makes some things we
need. We have a mutualistic relationship with our gut bacteria.
Bacteria divide by fission; however, this does not increase their genetic diversity. Instead, they can perform
conjugation with other bacterial cells and swap some of their DNA. Genetic variety among bacteria is leading to
increased antibiotic resistance.
Variations on Genetic Variation
Check out Chapter 10 for a more positive look at how an increase in genetic
variation makes it more likely that a population will survive a catastrophic
event.
Viruses
Viruses are nonliving agents capable of infecting cells. Why are viruses considered nonliving? They require a host
cellâ€™s machinery in order to replicate. A virus consists of two main components: a protein capsid and genetic
material made of DNA or RNA, depending on the virus. Viruses are all very specific in which type of cells they
infect, and the thing in
