 antibiotic in the agar on that plate, which killed the
nontransformed bacteria.
(B) The few colonies growing on Plate 1 consist of bacteria that
have taken up the plasmid and are resistant to ampicillin. Plate 2
consists of both antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as nonresistant
bacteria. There is no antibiotic in the agar on Plate 2 to distinguish
the two bacteria.
(A) There would be fluorescent bacteria on both Plates 1 and 2.
However, 100% of the bacteria on Plate 1 would fluoresce while
only a percentage of the bacteria on Plate 2 would do so.
(D) In an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakenly
attacks its own body structures. The antibodies attack the
postsynaptic muscle receptors, not the neuron function.
(D) Cell D happens to be a fat-storing cell from an animal. It has the
obvious trait of a large vacuole. Cell A is a white blood cell. Cell B
is an intestinal cell with microvilli projections. Cell C is a neuron.
(C) Some scientists believe that some complex molecules
