8. C. Because the graph shows that 450 nm and 600 nm each produce a high photosynthetic rate, and together
produce the highest rate, the graph indicates that the photosynthetic process depends on these two wavelengths.
Although light of 450 nm does induce significant photosynthetic activity, light of 600 nm induces more. A blue
solution indicates little or no photosynthesis has occurred because DPIP has not been reduced.
9. D. An increase in CO2 gas (from respiration) cannot be detected because it immediately reacts with KOH to
produce solid K2CO3. A live cricket will decrease the amount of O2 gas detected by the
respirometer. Changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure also cause the respirometer to register a change in
volume because temperature and atmospheric pressure affect the water pressure on the pipette inlets.
10. A. Since there is no insect and thus no O2 consumption in
 
respirometer 3, the purpose of this respirometer is to control
