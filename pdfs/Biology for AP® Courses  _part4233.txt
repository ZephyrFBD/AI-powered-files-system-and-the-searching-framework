Together, climate change and human activity pose dual threats to the long-term survival of the worldâ€™s
coral reefs. As global warming due to fossil fuel emissions raises ocean temperatures, coral reefs are
suffering. The excessive warmth causes the reefs to expel their symbiotic, food-producing algae, resulting
in a phenomenon known as bleaching. When bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their characteristic
color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged.
Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO2 dissolves
in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity. As acidity increases, it interferes with the
calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.
When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter. Coral reefs
are also economically impor
