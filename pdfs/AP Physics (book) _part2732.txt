7. Blue light of wavelength passes through a single slit of width d
and forms a diffraction pattern on a screen. If we replace
the blue light by red light of wavelength 
we can retain
the original diffraction pattern if we change the slit width
(a) to d 4.
(b) to d 2.
(c) not at all.
(d) to 2d.
(e) to 4d.
