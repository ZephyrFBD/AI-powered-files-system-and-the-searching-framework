ice (B) is incorrect. Streptomycin is not used as a nutrient source for E. coli, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
7. (C) The following figure shows the fragments that would be produced if the DNA was digested with both
EcoRI and BstI:
Choice (A) is incorrect because it lists the fragments that would be produced if the DNA was digested with
only BstI. Choice (B) in incorrect because it lists the fragments that would be produced if the DNA was
digested with only EcoRI. Choice (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account that when both
restriction enzymes are used, several of the larger original fragments will be cut and produce smaller fragments.
8. (B) The frequency of the recessive phenotype = q2. If q2 = 0.20, then the frequency of the recessive allele is q =
0.447. If the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the allele frequencies will not change, so q will still
be 0.447 after three generations.
9. (C) p + q = 1, so if q = 0.447, then p = 0.553. The frequency of the het
