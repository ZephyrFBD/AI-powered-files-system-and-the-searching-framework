 combined to make a s bond. (b) Sketch a p 
bond that is constructed from p orbitals. (c) Which is gener-
ally stronger, a s bond or a p bond? Explain. (d) Can two s 
orbitals combine to form a p bond? Explain.
 9.56  (a) If the valence atomic orbitals of an atom are sp hybrid-
ized, how many unhybridized p orbitals remain in the 
valence shell? How many p bonds can the atom form? 
 
(b) Imagine that you could hold two atoms that are bonded 
together, twist them, and not change the bond length. 
Would it be easier to twist (rotate) around a single s bond 
or around a double 1s plus p2 bond, or would they be the 
same?
 9.57 (a) Draw Lewis structures for ethane 1C2H62, ethylene 
1C2H42, and acetylene 1C2H22. (b) What is the hybridization 
of the carbon atoms in each molecule? (c) Predict which 
molecules, if any, are planar. (d) How many s and p bonds 
are there in each molecule?
 9.58  The nitrogen atoms in N2 participate in multiple bonding, 
whereas those in hydrazine, N2H4, do not.
