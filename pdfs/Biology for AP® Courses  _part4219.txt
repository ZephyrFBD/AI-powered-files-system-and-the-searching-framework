e arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10â€“12 weeks.
However, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the
Arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation
due to the cold temperatures.
Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground (Figure 35.20). There is little species diversity, low net primary
productivity, and low aboveground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred
to as permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic
matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic
tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens.
