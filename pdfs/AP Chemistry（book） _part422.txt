CHAPTER 3 Chemical Reactions and Reaction Stoichiometry
Percentage Composition from  
Chemical Formulas
Chemists must sometimes calculate the percentage composition of a compound—that is, 
the percentage by mass contributed by each element in the substance. Forensic chemists, 
for example, can measure the percentage composition of an unknown powder and com-
pare it with the percentage compositions of suspected substances (such as, sugar, salt, or 
cocaine) to identify the powder.
Calculating the percentage composition of any element in a substance (sometimes 
called the elemental composition of a substance) is straightfo
