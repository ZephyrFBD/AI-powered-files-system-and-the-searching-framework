earlobes, respectively. According to the information provided, the
frequency of the unattached phenotype (aa genotype) is 4,881/(4,881 +
7,192) = 0.404. Therefore, q2 = 0.404 and q = 0.64. Because p + q = 1, p =
1 – 0.64 = 0.36.
The frequency of the heterozygous Aa genotype is equal to 2pq, or
2(0.64)(0.36) = 0.46. Therefore, (C) is correct.

The cell cycle begins with the Gap 1 (G1) phase, in which the cell grows,
until it passes a checkpoint and proceeds to the Synthesis (S) phase, in
which new DNA is synthesized. Subsequently, the cell proceeds to the
Gap 2 (G2) phase, passing another checkpoint before beginning the
Mitotic (M) phase. The M phase is followed by cytokinesis, in which the
parent cell is divided into two daughter cells, each of which will then
begin G1 anew. Only (D) reflects this order, making it correct.

The lac operon is a genetic region in E. coli that includes the gene that
encodes for β-galactosidase. According to the information provided,
the lac ope
