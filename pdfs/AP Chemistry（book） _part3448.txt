NUCLEAR TRANSMUTATIONS (SECTION 21.3) Nuclear trans-
mutations, induced conversions of one nucleus into another, can 
be brought about by bombarding nuclei with either charged parti-
cles or neutrons. Particle accelerators increase the kinetic energies of 
positively charged particles, allowing these particles to overcome 
their electrostatic repulsion by the nucleus. Nuclear transmutations 
are used to produce the transuranium elements, those elements with 
atomic numbers greater than that of uranium.
RADIOACTIVE DECAY RATES AND DETECTION OF RADIOACTIV-
ITY (SECTIONS 21.4 AND 21.5) The SI unit for the activity of 
a radioactive source is the becquerel (Bq), defined as one nuclear 
disintegration per second. A related unit, the curie (Ci), corre-
sponds to 3.7 * 1010 disintegrations per second. Nuclear decay is 
a first-order process. The decay rate (activity) is therefore directly 
proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei. The half-life of a 
radionuclide, which is a
