t is, multiplication of a
vector by a positive scalar c changes the magnitude of the vector by a factor c but
doesn’t alter the direction. If c is a negative scalar (such as 
), the magnitude
of the product 
is changed by the factor 
(where 
means the magnitude of c),
but the direction is precisely opposite to that of

3–4 Adding Vectors by Components
Adding vectors graphically using a ruler and protractor is often not sufficiently
accurate and is not useful for vectors in three dimensions. We discuss now a more
powerful and precise method for adding vectors. But do not forget graphical
methods—they are useful for visualizing, for checking your math, and thus for
getting the correct result.
Components
Consider first a vector 
that lies in a particular plane. It can be expressed as 
the sum of two othe
