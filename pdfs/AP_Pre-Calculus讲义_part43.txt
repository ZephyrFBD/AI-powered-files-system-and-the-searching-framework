each factor in each interval. In the last row of the table determine the sign of the rational 
function on that interval. 
5. Solve. Determine the solution of the inequality from the last row of the table. Check 
whether the endpoints of these intervals satisfy the inequality. (This may happen if the 
inequality involves ≤ or ≥.)

1.10 Transformations of Functions 
In this section we study how certain transformations of a function affect its graph. 
This will give us a better understanding of how to graph functions. 
The transformations that we study are shifting, reflecting, and stretching. 
1.10.1 Vertical Shifting 
Adding a constant to a function shifts its graph vertically: upward if the constant is positive 
and downward if it is negative. 
In general, suppose we know the graph of y = f (x). How do we ob
