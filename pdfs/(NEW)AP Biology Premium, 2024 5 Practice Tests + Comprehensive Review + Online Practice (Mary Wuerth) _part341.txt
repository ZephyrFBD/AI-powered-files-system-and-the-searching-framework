DNA Replication
Overview
Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are the carriers of genetic information in living organisms. This genetic information
is transferred from one generation to the next generation through these nucleic acids. While prokaryotes and
eukaryotes typically use DNA as the carrier of genetic information between generations, some viruses use RNA as
their primary genetic material. Prokaryotes package their DNA into circular chromosomes in a region called the
nucleoid. Eukaryotes package their DNA into linear chromosomes in the nucleus. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
can carry additional genetic information in the form of small, circular pieces of DNA called plasmids, which are
