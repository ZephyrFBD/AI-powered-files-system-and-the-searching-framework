orks by generating action potentials along
neurons; the endocrine system uses chemical messengers called hormones that are released from glands, travel to target
cells, and elicit a response by the target cell. For APÂ® you are not expected to memorize a laundry list of the various
endocrine glands, their hormones, and the effects of each hormone. You should be able to interpret, however, a diagram that
shows the activity of a hormonal signal. We will briefly describe a few of these examples in How Hormones Work.
There are three types of hormones classified based on molecular structure and properties. (We explored structure/function
relationships at the molecular level in the chapter on Biological Macromolecules.) Lipid-derived hormones are lipid-
soluble and can diffuse across cell membranes because they are non-polar. Most lipid hormones are derived from
cholesterol; examples include steroids such as estrogen and testosterone. Because lipid hormones can diffuse across cell
membranes,
