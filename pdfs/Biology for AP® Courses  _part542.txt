ate between
body cells (called “self”) and foreign cells or tissues (called “non-self”). Similar types of glycoproteins and glycolipids are
found on the surfaces of viruses and may change frequently, preventing immune cells from recognizing and attacking them.
These carbohydrates on the exterior surface of the cell—the carbohydrate components of both glycoproteins and
glycolipids—are collectively referred to as the glycocalyx (meaning “sugar coating”). The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic
and attracts large amounts of water to the surface of the cell. This aids in the interaction of the cell with its watery
environment and in the cell’s ability to obtain substances dissolved in the water. As discussed above, the glycocalyx is
also important for cell identification, self/non-self determination, and embryonic development, and is used in cell-cell
attachments to form tissues.
