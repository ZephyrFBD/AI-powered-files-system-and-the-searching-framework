 the freezing point of water 10 °C2, Kw = 1.2 * 10-15. 
Calculate 3H+4 and 3OH-4 for a neutral solution at this 
temperature.
 16.32  Deuterium oxide 1D2O, where D is deuterium, the 
 
hydrogen-2 isotope) has an ion-product constant, Kw, of 
8.9 * 10-16 at 20 °C. Calculate 3D+4 and 3OD-4 for pure 
(neutral) D2O at this temperature.
The ph Scale (Section 16.4)
 16.33  By what factor does 3H+4 change for a pH change of (a) 2.00 
units, (b) 0.50 units?
 16.34  Consider two solutions, solution A and solution B. 3H+4 in 
solution A is 250 times greater than that in solution B. What 
is the difference in the pH values of the two solutions?
