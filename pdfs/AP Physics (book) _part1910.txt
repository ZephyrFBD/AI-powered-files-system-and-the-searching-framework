A capacitor is a device used to store charge (and electric
energy), and consists of two nontouching conductors. The two
conductors hold equal and opposite charges, of magnitude Q.
The ratio of this charge Q to the potential difference V between
the conductors is called the capacitance, C:
(17;7)
The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is proportional
to the area A of each plate and inversely proportional to their
separation d:
(17;8)
The space between the two conductors of a capacitor 
contains a nonconducting material such as air, paper, or plastic.
These materials are referred to as dielectrics, and the capaci-
tance is proportional to a property of dielectrics called the
dielectric constant, K (equal to 1 for air).
A charged capacitor stores an amount of electric energy
given by
(17;10)
This energy can be thought of as stored in the electric field
between the plates.
