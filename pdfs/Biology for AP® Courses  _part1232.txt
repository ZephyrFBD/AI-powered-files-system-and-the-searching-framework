cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis.
Prophase II
If the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into
vesicles. The centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and
new spindles are formed.
Prometaphase II
The nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. Each sister chromatid forms an

individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles.
Metaphase II
The sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell.
Anaphase II
The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles. Non-kinetochore
microtubules elongate the cell.
Figure 11.5 The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I
