ely selected against, and only mice with large jaws survive on Island B. The survival on the other
islands is not directly relevant.

Punctuated equilibrium is defined as an isolated episode of rapid development of a population. A slow change,
described in (A) and (C), or a fluctuation, described in (D), do not suggest a quick change.

The percent change in mass will be closest to 0% when the solutions are isotonic. In other words, the potato
cells should stay the same mass when they are soaked in a sodium chloride solution with a similar
concentration as the cells. The percent change crosses over from a gain to a loss between 0.3 M and 0.5 M, so
the isotonic concentration must occur between these two molarities. Only (D) describes a number in between
these concentrations.

HRIET1 has a signal sequence AND a targeting signal, so it must be part of an organelle that is in the secretory
pathway that helps things exit the cell. The Golgi apparatus is the only organelle amon
