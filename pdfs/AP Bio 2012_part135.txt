 interactions between amino acids on the 
surface.
(B)
This option is incorrect. A point mutation, which causes the replacement of an 
amino acid with another amino acid, has already occurred in the DNA. The 
replacement of one amino acid would not alter the hydrogen bonding between 
nitrogenous bases in the structure of DNA.
(C)
This option is incorrect. A point mutation, which causes the replacement of a 
hydrophilic amino acid R-group with another amino acid that has a hydrophobic 
R-group, would not alter a fatty acid.
(D)
This option is incorrect. A mutation is not likely to alter the secondary structure 
of a protein. The secondary structure of proteins is due to hydrogen bonding 
between the carboxyl and amine residues in the chain, not interactions between 
R-groups.
