(this is called the hexyl group) for all compounds. (b) What 
mass of the “hexyl Ugi product” would you form if 435.0 mg of 
 
CH3 CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2 was the limiting reactant?

You will learn later in this book that sulfur is capable of forming two 
common oxides, SO2 and SO3. One question that we might ask is 
whether the direct reaction between sulfur and oxygen leads to the 
formation of SO2, SO3, or a mixture of the two. This question has prac-
tical significance because SO3 can go on to react with water to form 
sulfuric acid, H2SO4, which is produced industrially on a very large 
scale. Consider also that the answer to this question may depend on 
the relative amount of each element that is present and the tempera-
ture at which the reaction is carried out. For example, on the one 
hand, carbon and oxygen normally react to form CO2, but when 
not enough oxygen is present, CO can form. On the other hand, un-
