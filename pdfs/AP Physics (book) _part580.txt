r on
the backpack, we use Eq. 6–1, where is shown in Fig. 6–4c,
and we note from Fig.6–4a that  
So the work done by the hiker is
The work done depends only on the elevation change and not on the angle of the
hill,
The hiker would do the same work to lift the pack vertically by height h.
(b) The work done by gravity on the backpack is (from Eq. 6–1 and Fig. 6–4c)
Since  
(Appendix A–7), we have
NOTE The work done by gravity (which is negative here) does not depend on the
angle of the incline, only on the vertical height h of the hill.
5. Net work done.(c) The net work done on the backpack is  
because the
net force on the backpack is zero (it is assumed not to accelerate significantly).
We can also get the net work done by adding the work done by each force:
NOTE Even though the net work done by all the forces on the backpack is zero,
the hiker does do work on the backpack equal to 1470 J.
