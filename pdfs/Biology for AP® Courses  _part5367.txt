an absolute no-no. They had an extremely active and adaptive
immune system and their brain was incredibly active with so much
to learn. ‘The child’s brain, or the youth’s brain, is thirsting for
oxygen.’ The more metabolically active an organ was, the more
oxygen it required; and in children and adolescents every organ was
metabolically active. Griesz-Brisson said that to deprive a child’s or
adolescent’s brain of oxygen, or to restrict it in any way, was not only
dangerous to their health, it was absolutely criminal. ‘Oxygen
deﬁciency inhibits the development of the brain, and the damage
that has taken place as a result CANNOT be reversed.’ Mind
manipulators of MKUltra put masks on two-year-olds they wanted
to neurologically rewire and you can see why. Griesz-Brisson said a
child needs the brain to learn and the brain needs oxygen to
function. ‘We don’t need a clinical study for that. This is simple,
indisputable physiology.’ Consciously and purposely induced
oxygen deﬁciency was an a
