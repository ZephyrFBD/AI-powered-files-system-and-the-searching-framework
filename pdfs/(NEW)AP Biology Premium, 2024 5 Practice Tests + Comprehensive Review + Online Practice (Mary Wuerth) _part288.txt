cells. Choices (C) and (D) are both incorrect because somatic cells and gametes have different numbers
of chromosomes, not the same number of chromosomes.
3. (A) Genetic recombination (crossing-over), which generates genetic diversity, occurs during prophase I.
Choices (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because genetic diversity is not generated in prophase II, anaphase I, or
anaphase II. (Note that genetic diversity is generated in metaphase I of meiosis, but that is not one of the choices
in this question.)
4. (A) Pairs of homologous chromosomes assort independently during metaphase I. Choice (B) is incorrect
because individual chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate in metaphase II, and no independent assortment
of chromosomes occurs. In both telophase I and telophase II, new nuclear membranes are formed. No
assortment of chromosomes occurs during those stages, so choices (C) and (D) are incorrect.
5. (C) DNA is replicated once before meiosis I starts, and meiosis is comprised of tw
