12.3 ∣ Metallic Solids
Metallic solids, also simply called metals, consist entirely of metal atoms. The bond-
ing in metals is too strong to be due to dispersion forces, and yet there are not enough 
valence electrons to form covalent bonds between atoms. The bonding, called metallic 
bonding, happens because the valence electrons are delocalized throughout the entire 
solid. That is, the valence electrons are not associated with specific atoms or bonds but 
are spread throughout the solid. In fact, we can visualize a metal as an array of positive 
ions immersed in a “sea” of delocalized valence electrons.
When light waves pass through a narrow slit, they are scattered in such 
a way that the wave seems to spread out. This physical phenomenon 
is called diffraction. When light passes through many evenly spaced 
narrow slits (a diffraction grating), the scattered waves interact to
