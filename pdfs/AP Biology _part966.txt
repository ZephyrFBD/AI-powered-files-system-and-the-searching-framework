s, there is less cancer. Therefore, the presence of
miR-215 seems to correlate with healthy tissue.
Graph B shows that apoptosis is high in the presence of a
substance that mimics miR-215 (about 30%) and that apoptosis
is low in the presence of a substance that inhibits miR-215
(about 6%).
Sometimes, normal cells become cancerousâ€”something causes
them to keep dividing, grow out of control, and form a tumor (a
clump of cancerous tissue). In most cases in our bodies,
thankfully, these cancerous cells are directed to die by
apoptosis before they become a large tumor. According to
Graph B, apoptosis is enhanced in tissue with an miR-215
mimic. Furthermore, when miR-215 is inhibited, so is
apoptosis. Therefore, an miR-215 mimic might slow the growth
of a tumor by causing precancerous or cancerous cells to die by
apoptosis, as the researcher predicts.
The data on Graph A show that high levels of miR-215 are
found in normal tissue but are lacking in cancerous breast
