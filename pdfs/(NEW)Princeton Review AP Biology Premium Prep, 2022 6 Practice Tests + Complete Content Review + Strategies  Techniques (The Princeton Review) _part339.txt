 needs to be expressed will be transcribed. If you wanted to make a cake, but your
cookbook couldn’t leave your vault (aka the nucleus), you wouldn’t copy the entire cookbook! You would copy
only the recipe for the cake.
Since each recipe is a gene, transcription occurs as-needed on a gene-by-gene basis.
The exception to this is prokaryotes because they will transcribe a recipe that can be used to make several proteins.
This is called a polycistronic transcript. Eukaryotes tend to have one gene that gets transcribed to one mRNA and
translated into one protein. Our transcripts are monocistronic.
Transcription involves three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. As in DNA replication, the first
initiation step in transcription is to unwind and unzip the DNA strands using helicase. Transcription begins at special
sequences of the DNA strand called promoters. You can think of a promoter as a docking site or a runway. We will
talk about how promoters are involved in regulating tr
