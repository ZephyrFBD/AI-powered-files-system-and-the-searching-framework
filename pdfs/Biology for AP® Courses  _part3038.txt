Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/vertebrate_evol) of biologist Mark Kirschner discussing the “flipping”
phenomenon of vertebrate evolution.
The nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and
glia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary
to neurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire—it transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be
compared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take
down wires that are broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that also usurp some
of the signaling functions of neurons.
There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in
