Endocrine Signaling
Signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals, and they originate from endocrine cells. (In the body, many
endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.)
These types of signals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect. The ligands released in endocrine
signaling are called hormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions
some distance away.
Hormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively
slow way to move throughout the body. Because of their form of transport, hormones get diluted and are present in low
concentrations when they act on their target cells. This is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations
of ligands can be very high.
