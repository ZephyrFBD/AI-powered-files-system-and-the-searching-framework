he ribosome during translation to generate 
the primary peptide sequence based on the 
mRNA sequence.
c. rRNA molecules are functional building 
blocks of ribosomes.
IST-1.N.2
Genetic information flows from a sequence 
of nucleotides in DNA to a sequence of bases 
in an mRNA molecule to a sequence of amino 
acids in a protein.
IST-1.N.3
RNA polymerases use a single template strand 
of DNA to direct the inclusion of bases in the 
newly formed RNA molecule. This process is 
known as transcription.
