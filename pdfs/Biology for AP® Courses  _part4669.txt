m (NH4+).
b.
Denitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3-) to nitrogen gas (N2).
c.
Nitrification by bacteria converts nitrates (NO3-) to nitrites (NO2-).
d.
Nitrogen fixing bacteria convert nitrogen gas (N2) into organic compounds.
Human activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels, which
releases different nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes,
streams, and rivers by surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earthâ€™s ecosystems
including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing
climate change. A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient
runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.
A similar process occurs in the mari
