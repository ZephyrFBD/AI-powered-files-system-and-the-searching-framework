0. These two
chlorophyll molecules, named with numbers that represent the wavelengths at which they absorb their maximum
amounts of light (680 and 700 nanometers, respectively), are different from other chlorophyll molecules because of
their association with various nearby pigments. Together with
these other pigments, chlorophyll P700forms a pigment cluster called photosystem I (PS I). Chlorophyll P680 forms
photosystem II (PS II).
 
Photosynthesis includes the following processes:
 
1. Noncyclic photophosphorylation and cyclic photophosphorylation
 
use H2O and the energy in sunlight to generate ATP, NADPH, and O2. 2. The Calvin cycle uses CO2 and the
energy in ATP and NADPH to
 
make glucose.
The chemical reactions for photosynthesis are illustrated in Figure 5-1. Refer to the figure as you read the following
descriptions of the metabolic processes.
Noncyclic Photophosphorylation
Photophosphorylation is the process of using energy derived from light (photo) to generate ATP from adeno
