site of RNA polymerase, positioning the RNA polymerase
to begin to transcribe RNA at the appropriate position.
Repressor: Protein that inhibits gene transcription. In the operon of
prokaryotes, repressors bind to the operator.
Regulator gene: Gene that codes for a repressor. It is located some
distance from its operon and has its own promoter.

PRIONS
Prions are not cells nor are they viruses. They are misfolded versions of a
protein normally found in the brain. If prions get into a normal brain, they
cause all the normal versions of the protein to misfold in the same way.
Prions are infectious and cause several brain diseases: scrapie in sheep,
mad cow disease in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. All
known prion diseases are fatal.
THE HUMAN GENOME
The human genome consists of 3 billion base pairs of DNA and includes
about 22,000 genes. Surprisingly, only a tiny fraction (1%) of our DNA
actually gets translated into proteins.
