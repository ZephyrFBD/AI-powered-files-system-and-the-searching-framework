hat is the radius of cur-
vature of the mirror?
80. Light is incident on an equilateral glass prism at a 45.0°
angle to one face, Fig. 23–64. Calculate the angle at which
light emerges from the opposite face. Assume that
n = 1.54.
85. Which of the two lenses shown in Fig. 23–66 is converging,
and which is diverging? Explain using ray diagrams and
show how each image is formed.
86. Figure 23–67 shows a liquid-detecting prism device that
might be used inside a washing machine. If no liquid
covers the prism’s hypotenuse, total internal reflection of
the beam from the light source produces a large signal in
the light sensor. If liquid covers the hypotenuse, some 
light escapes from the prism into the liquid and the light
sensor’s signal decreases. Thus a large signal from the 
light sensor indicates the absence of liquid in the reservoir.
Determine the allowable range for the prism’s index of
refraction n.
