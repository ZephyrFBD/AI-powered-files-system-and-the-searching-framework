frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). Lower
frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. The basic pitch-
determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. The place theory
is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception. Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it
is thought that there must be some auditory “sharpening” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.
When sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach
to the tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along
the neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs
bend, they release an excitatory neuro
