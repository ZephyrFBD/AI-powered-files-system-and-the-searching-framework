ctrical semiconductors and are 
the principal elements used in integrated circuits and computer chips. One of the 
reasons metalloids can be used for integrated circuits is that their electrical con-
ductivity is intermediate between that of metals and that of nonmetals. Very pure 
silicon is an electrical insulator, but its conductivity can be dramatically increased 
with the addition of specific impurities called dopants. This modification provides a 
mechanism for controlling the electrical conductivity by controlling the chemical 
composition. We will return to this point in Chapter 12.

Trends for Group 1A and  
Group 2A Metals
As we have seen, elements in a given group possess general similarities. However, 
trends also exist within each group. In this section, we use the periodic table and 
our knowledge of electron configurations to examine the chemistry of the alkali 
 
metals and alkaline earth metals.
Group 1A: The Alkali Metals
The alkali metals are soft metallic sol
