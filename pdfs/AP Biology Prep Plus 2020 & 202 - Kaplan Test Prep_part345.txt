ition because high concentrations of
substrate can outcompete a competitive inhibitor and reach
the same maximum velocity.

4. Researchers are studying the reaction rate of mevalonate-5-
phosphate (Mev-P), an enzyme. The graph below shows the rate
of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction as the initial concentration of
Mev-P is increased.
The graph is plotted using the initial concentration and reaction
rate. Which of the following provides the most likely reason why
the researchers used these initial values instead of values
determined aȇer the reaction had been allowed to progress?

Saccharomyces cerevisiae,” PLoS ONE 9, no. 1 (January

At the beginning of the reaction, the enzyme works more
slowly. Over time, the reaction increases in rate as the
concentration of the substrate goes down.

The reaction will generate heat, which will increase the
reaction rate as the reaction progre
