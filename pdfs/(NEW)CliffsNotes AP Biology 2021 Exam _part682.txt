habitat. Animals do, however, affect the physical
characteristics of the community by adding organic matter when they leave feces or decompose, and affect the
biological characteristics of the community when they trample or consume plants or when they disperse seeds. But
because animals are transient, their effects on succession are often difficult to determine.
The plants and animals that are first to colonize a newly exposed habitat are called pioneer species. They are
typically opportunistic, r-selected species that have good dispersal capabilities, are fast growing, and produce many
progeny rapidly. Many pioneer species can tolerate harsh conditions such as intense sunlight, shifting sand, rocky
substrate, arid climates, or nutrientdeficient soil. For example, nutrient-deficient soils of some early successional
stages harbor nitrogen-fixing bacteria or support the growth of plants whose roots support mutualistic relationships
with these bacteria.
