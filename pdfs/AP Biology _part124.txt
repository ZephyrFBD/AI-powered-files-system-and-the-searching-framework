e up flagella,
cilia, and spindle fibers. The other three answer choices all refer to
microfilaments, which are solid, made of actin, and form a cleavage
furrow in a dividing cell. (SYI-1)
(B) The theory of endosymbiosis explains how eukaryotic cells—
those with internal membranes—came about. Small prokaryotic
cells took up residence inside larger prokaryotic cells for the mutual
benefit of both cells. The mutualistic relationship was so successful
that it became permanent. For example, a small photosynthetic alga
became engulfed by a larger cell. The larger cell provided all the
cell’s machinery to both cells, while the smaller cell provided food
for both cells. This was the origin of the chloroplast. (EVO-1)
(A) The surface area of the cell membrane increases more slowly
than the volume does. Observe the different formulas: The formula
for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr2 (increases as a square
function), while the formula for the volume of a sphere is 43⁢π⁢r3
(increases as a cub
