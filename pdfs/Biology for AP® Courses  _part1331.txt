tions of dominance and recessiveness
irrelevant for XY males. Drosophila males lack a second allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only
be XWY or XwY. In contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.
Figure 12.11 In Drosophila, several genes determine eye color. The genes for white and vermilion eye colors are
located on the X chromosome. Others are located on the autosomes. Clockwise from top left are brown, cinnabar,
sepia, vermilion, white, and red. Red eye color is wild-type and is dominant to white eye color.
In an X-linked cross, the genotypes of F1 and F2 offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male
or the female in the P1 generation. With regard to Drosophila eye color, when the P1 male expresses the white-eye phenotype
and the female is homozygous red-eyed, all members of the F1 generation exhibit red eyes (Figure 12.12). The F1 females
are heterozygous (XWXw), and the males are all XWY
