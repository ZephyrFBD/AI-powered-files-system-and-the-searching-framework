ould provide an advantage in San Francisco (where the
mosquito that carries malaria does not live) and which genotype would be most advantageous to survival in
Haiti (where the mosquito that carries malaria is found).
12. Fur color in hamsters is determined by a single gene, with yellow fur color being dominant to white fur color.
Inheriting two copies of the allele for yellow fur color is fatal, so all individuals with yellow fur are
heterozygous.
(a) Determine the probability that the offspring of two hamsters with yellow fur would also have yellow fur.
(b) Construct a Punnett square that represents the two hamster parents from part (a), and use the Punnett
square to explain your answer to part (a).
(c) A hamster population lives in an area covered with yellow-goldenrod-colored grasses. An unusually cold
winter results in the death of all the yellow-goldenrod-colored grasses, so in the spring the area is covered
only in white sand. Predict what would happen to the frequency of the al
