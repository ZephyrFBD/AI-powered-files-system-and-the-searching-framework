 that produced them. Flowering plants seem to have
evolved a specialized region where a plant can become “pregnant.”
These “seed babies” are housed within a seed coat and oȇen a fruiting
body. The seed coat and fruiting body aid in plant propagation by either
acting as bait to an animal or providing a source of nutrition to the
developing plant embryo.
VARIATION IN PLANTS
The terrestrial environment provides a great degree of variation, in
contrast to the constant temperatures and cycles of aquatic systems.
Seasonal changes and the variability of weather requires plants to
synthesize new chemical messengers that allow plant tissues to respond
to both acute and chronic environmental cues. Novel structures,
primarily for reproduction, require new forms of control mechanisms to
function in time with a changing environment.
Within the plant kingdom are several phyla, with one of the key
distinguishing characteristics between phyla being the presence or
absence of vascular tissue. Within th
