 occur 5000 times faster than when it 
is uncatalyzed. By how many kJ>mol must an enzyme lower 
the activation energy of the reaction to make it useful?
 14.116 Enzymes are often described as following the two-step 
mechanism:
E + S ∆ ES 1fast2
ES ¡  E + P 1slow2
 
 where E = enzyme, S = substrate,
 
 ES = enzyme9substrate complex, and P = product.
 
 (a) If an enzyme follows this mechanism, what rate law 
is expected for the reaction? (b) Molecules that can bind 
to the active site of an enzyme but are not converted into 
product are called enzyme inhibitors. Write an additional 
elementary step to add into the preceding mechanism to 
account for the reaction of E with I, an inhibitor.

[14.117] Dinitrogen pentoxide 1N2O52 decomposes in chloroform 
as a solvent to yield NO2 and O2. The decomposition is 
ﬁrst order with a rate constant at 45 °C of 1.0 * 10-5 s-1. 
Calculate the partial pressure of O2 p
