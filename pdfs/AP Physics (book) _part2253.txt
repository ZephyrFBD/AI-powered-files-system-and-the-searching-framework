Summary
Two currents exert a force on each other via the magnetic
field each produces. Parallel currents in the same direction
attract each other; currents in opposite directions repel.
The magnetic field inside a long tightly wound solenoid is
(20;8)
where N is the number of loops in a length of coil, and I is the
current in each loop.
Ampère’s law states that around any chosen closed loop
path, the sum of each path segment 
times the component 
of 
parallel to the segment equals 
times the current I
enclosed by the closed path:
(20;9)
The torque on N loops of current I in a magnetic field 
is
(20;10)
The force or torque exerted on a current-carrying wire by a
magnetic field is the basis for operation of many devices, such
as motors, loudspeakers, and galvanometers used in analog
electric meters.

determine the mass of ions.]
