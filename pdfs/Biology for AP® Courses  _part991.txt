46. On a hot, dry day, plants close their stomata to
conserve water. Explain the connection between the
oxidation of water in photosystem II of the light-dependent
reactions and the synthesis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
(G3PA) in the light-independent reactions. Predict the
effect of closed stomata on the synthesis of G3PA and
justify the prediction.
