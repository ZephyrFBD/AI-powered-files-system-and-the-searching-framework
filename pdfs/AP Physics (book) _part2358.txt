†Why the name “Flash”? It may come from the erase process: large blocks erased “in a flash,” and or
because the earliest floating gate memories were erased by a flash of UV light which ejected the
stored electrons.

Electromagnetic induction is the physical basis of a GFCI. As shown in 
Fig.21–33,the two conductors of a power line connected to an electric circuit or device
(red) pass through a small iron ring.Around the ring are ma
