Because of such decay series, certain radioactive elements are found in
nature that otherwise would not be. When the solar system (including Earth) 
was formed about 5 billion years ago, it is believed that nearly all nuclides were
present, having been formed (by fusion and neutron capture, Sections 31–3 and
33–2) in a nearby supernova explosion (Section 33–2). Many isotopes with short
half-lives decayed quickly and no longer are detected in nature today. But 
long-lived isotopes, such as 
with a half-life of 
still do exist in
nature today. Indeed, about half of the original 
still remains. We might
expect, however, that radium 
with a half-life of 1600 yr, would have
disappeared f
