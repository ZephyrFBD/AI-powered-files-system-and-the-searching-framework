or after an Rhâ€“ woman has an Rh+ baby. The first exposure does not usually cause a reaction; however,
at the second exposure, enough antibodies have built up in the blood to produce a reaction that causes
agglutination and breakdown of red blood cells. An injection can prevent this reaction.
Figure 31.9 Human red blood cells may have either type A or B glycoproteins on their surface, both glycoproteins
combined (AB), or neither (O). The glycoproteins serve as antigens and can elicit an immune response in a person
who receives a transfusion containing unfamiliar antigens. Type O blood, which has no A or B antigens, does not
elicit an immune response when injected into a person of any blood type. Thus, O is considered the universal
donor. Persons with type AB blood can accept blood from any blood type, and type AB is considered the universal
acceptor.
