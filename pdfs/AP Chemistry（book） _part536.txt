 forms of life has helped determine 
diverse biological structures. Indeed, most of the 
mass of our bodies is water, and the chemical 
reactions responsible for life occur in water. In 
contrast, much of the chemical industry relies on 
either high temperatures or other liquids for creating 
and purifying compounds (Figure 4.1).
A solution in which water is the dissolving medium is called an aque-
ous solution. In this chapter we examine chemical reactions that take 
place in aqueous solutions. In addition, we extend the concepts of stoi-
chiometry learned in Chapter 3 by considering how solution concentra-
tions are expressed and used. Although the reactions we will discuss in 
this chapter are relatively simple, they form the basis for understanding 
very complex reaction cycles in biology, geology, and oceanography.
