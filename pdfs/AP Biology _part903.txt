Before the human genome was sequenced by the Human Genome
Project, scientists expected that they would find about 100,000
genes. In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000
genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few
genes?
Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function
of genes.
Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits.
This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed.
A single gene can produce more than one trait because of
alternative splicing.
