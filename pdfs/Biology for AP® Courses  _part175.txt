nd nonpolar. In a polar covalent bond, shown in this figure, the electrons
are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution
of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (δ+) or slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. This
partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.
Water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative
charge. This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than
the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen’s electrons. Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared
electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving
the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. An
