n and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the
newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called
ATPase. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a “cocked” position. The
myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and Pi are still attached.
If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP
hydrolyzed, but still attached.
If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the
actin and myosin molecules. Pi is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change.
The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move
approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is called the power
