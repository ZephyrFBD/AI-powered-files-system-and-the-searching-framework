l turnover. The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that
recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water (Figure 35.10). These
turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different

from that of the surrounding layers. In wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. However,
the water under the ice is slightly warmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 °C to 5 °C (39.2 °F to
41 °F). Water is densest at 4 °C; therefore, the deepest water is also the densest. The deepest water is oxygen poor because
the decomposition of organic material at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot be replaced by means
of oxygen diffusion into the water due to the surface ice layer.
