esent in the resultant spectra (Figure 6.11). Each col-
ored line in such spectra represents light of one wavelength. A spectrum containing radi-
ation of only specific wavelengths is called a line spectrum.
When scientists first detected the line spectrum of hydrogen in the mid-1800s, 
they were fascinated by its simplicity. At that time, only four lines at wavelengths of 
410 nm  
(violet), 434 nm (blue), 486 nm (blue-green), and 656 nm (red) were observed 
(Figure 6.11). In 1885, a Swiss schoolteacher named Johann Balmer showed that the 
wavelengths of these four lines fit an intriguingly simple formula that relates the 
wavelengths to integers. Later, additional lines were found in the ultraviolet and infra-
red regions of hydrogen’s line  
spectrum. Soon Balmer’s equation was extended to a 
more general one, called the Rydberg equation, which allows us to calculate the wave-
lengths of all the spectral lines of hydrogen:
