illiequivalent
In order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for
measuring solutes is the mole. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular
weight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. The molarity of a solution is
the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram
of solvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used
to express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per
liter (mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on
the ion. The unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes f
