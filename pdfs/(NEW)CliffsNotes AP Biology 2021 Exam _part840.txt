homozygous recessive individuals can also be explained if these individuals leave the
population (emigrate) for another location.
15. A. Water potential is highest in the soil, decreases from root to leaf, and is lowest in the air. Water moves from
the soil into the roots and through the plant and transpires from the leaf because water moves from the area of
highest water potential to the area of lowest water potential.
16. D. When water entering roots cannot adequately replace the water loss by transpiration, the stomata close to
prevent wilting. 17. A. The tallest vertical bar (above 0% salt concentration) indicates the preference of the greatest
number of brine shrimp.
18. C. The predators of brine shrimp cannot survive in bodies of water with high concentrations of salt. Thus, brine
shrimp survive in bodies of water with a high salt concentration because predators are absent. In waters with low
concentrations of salt, predators eliminate the brine shrimp.
19. C. The gross primary p
