to atmosphere. Water potential defines the flow of water in a system (the
tendency of water to move from one area to another). The table lists
water potential for a plant system.
Component
Water Potential (MPa)
Component

–0.8 – –7.0
Atmosphere
–10.0 – –100.0
Which of the following statements is most consistent with the
information in the table?
When water evaporates from a leaf into the atmosphere, it moves
from higher water potential to lower water potential.
