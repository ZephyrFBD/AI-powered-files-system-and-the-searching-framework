. Gap junctions
allow small molecules, including signaling molecules, to flow between neighboring cells.
Internal receptors are found in the cell cytoplasm. Here, they bind ligand molecules that cross the plasma membrane; these
receptor-ligand complexes move to the nucleus and interact directly with cellular DNA. Cell-surface receptors transmit a
signal from outside the cell to the cytoplasm. Ion channel-linked receptors, when bound to their ligands, form a pore
through the plasma membrane through which certain ions can pass. G-protein-linked receptors interact with a G-protein on
the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, promoting the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and interacting with other
enzymes or ion channels to transmit a signal. Enzyme-linked receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to an
intracellular domain of a membrane-bound enzyme. Ligand binding causes activation of the enzyme. Small hydrophobic
ligands (like steroids) are able to penetrate the plasma membrane
