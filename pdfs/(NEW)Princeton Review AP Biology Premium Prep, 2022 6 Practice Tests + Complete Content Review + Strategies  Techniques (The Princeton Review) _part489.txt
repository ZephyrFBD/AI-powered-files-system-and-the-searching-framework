Summary
Descriptive statistics (such as mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, mode, range) and graphs are
used to summarize data and show patterns and conclusions:
Normal (parametric) measurement data are summarized by using mean and standard deviation or standard
error.
Parametric data are summarized by using median, mode, and range.
Histograms can be used to see if a dataset has a standard deviation or not.
Count data is summarized in a bar graph or a pie graph.
Time course experiments look at how something changes over time; summarize these using a line graph.
Experiments that compare groups are summarized in a bar graph (if the dataset has a standard deviation) or a
box-and-whisker plot (if it does not).
Scatterplots summarize association experiments, and regre
