y as long as the
meson exists, which is the time 
required for the meson to pass from one
nucleon to the other, where it is absorbed and disappears. If we assume the
meson travels at relativistic speed, close to the speed of light c, then 
need be
at most about 
where d is the maximum distance that can separate the
interacting nucleons. Thus we can write
or
(32;3)
The range of the strong nuclear force (the maximum distance away it can be felt)
is small—not much more than the size of a nucleon or small nucleus (see
Eq. 30–1)—so let us take
Then from Eq. 32–3,
The mass of the predicted meson, roughly 
is about 250 times the
electron mass of 
EXERCISE B What effect does an increase in the mass of the virtual exchange particle
have on the range of the force it mediates? (a) Decreases it; (b) increases it; (c) has no
appreciable effect; (d) decreases the range for charged particles and increases the range
for neutral particles.
Note that since the electromagnetic force has infinite range, E
