Applying first the conversions for distance and then those for 
time, we can set up one long equation in which unwanted 
units are canceled:
 Speed in mi>hr = a515m
s b a 1 km
103 m
b a
1 mi
1.6093 kmb a 60 s

1 hr
b
 = 1.15 * 103 mi>hr
Our answer has the desired units. We can check our calculation, 
using the estimating procedure described in the “Strategies in Chem-
istry” box. The given speed is about 500 m>s. Dividing by 1000 
converts m to km, giving 0.5 km>s. Because 1 mi is about 1.6 km, 
this speed corresponds to 0.5>1.6 = 0.3 mi>s. Multiplying by 60 
gives about 0.3 * 60 = 20 mi>min. Multiplying again by 60 gives 
20 * 60 = 1200 mi>hr. The approximate solution (about 1200 mi/
hr) and the detailed solution (1
150 mi/hr) are reasonably close. The  
answer to the detailed solution has three significant figures, correspond-
