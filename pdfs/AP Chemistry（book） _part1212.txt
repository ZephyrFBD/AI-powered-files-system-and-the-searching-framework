f using ultraviolet light to eject va-
lence electrons, X rays are used to eject core electrons. The en-
ergies of the core electrons are different for different oxidation 
states of the element. In one set of experiments, researchers 
examined mercury contamination of minerals in water. They 
measured the XPS signals that corresponded to electrons eject-
ed from mercury’s 4f orbitals at 105 eV, from an X-ray source 
that provided 1253.6 eV of energy 11 ev = 1.602 * 10-19J2. 
The oxygen on the mineral surface gave emitted electron en-
ergies at 531 eV, corresponding to the 1s orbital of oxygen. 
Overall the researchers concluded that oxidation states were 
+2 for Hg and -2 for O. (a) Calculate the wavelength of the 
X rays used in this experiment. (b) Compare the energies of 
the 4f electrons in mercury and the 1s electrons in oxygen 
from these data to the ﬁrst ionization energies of mercury 
and oxygen from the data in this chapter. (c) Write out the 
ground-state electron conﬁgurati
