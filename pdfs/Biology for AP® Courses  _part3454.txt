The Vertebral Column
The vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an
attachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck. The adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones: the 24
vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx bones. In the adult, the sacrum is typically composed of five vertebrae that fuse into
one. The coccyx is typically 3–4 vertebrae that fuse into one. Around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse
together. We begin life with approximately 33 vertebrae, but as we grow, several vertebrae fuse together. The adult vertebrae
are further divided into the 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae (Figure 29.8).
