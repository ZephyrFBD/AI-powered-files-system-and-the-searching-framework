• 
Response must show an X placed on the line leading to Bovidae and an X placed on 
the line leading to Antilocapridae.

(d) 
 Based on Figure 1A, explain why a characteristic found only in the Cervidae and Bovidae 
families is more likely evidence of convergent evolution than it is of common ancestry. 
Accept one of the following:  
• 
There are other families that have the same common ancestor as the Bovidae and 
Cervidae families but do not have the characteristic. 
• 
It is more likely that the characteristic arose independently in Cervidae and Bovidae 
than it arose in their common ancestor and was lost in Giraffidae, Moschidae, and 
Antilocapridae.
