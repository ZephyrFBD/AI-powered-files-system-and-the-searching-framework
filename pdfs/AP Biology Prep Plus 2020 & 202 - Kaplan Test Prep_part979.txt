g seeds will not reduce tetrazolium, and thus
remain white.
Germinating corn seeds will be redder
than non-germinating corn seeds.
Germinating seeds have higher rates of
cellular respiration and thus a higher
concentration of hydrogen ions, which
reduce tetrazolium to a red compound
that stains living cells.
3. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 3
(a) Describe plasmids and their involvement in passing hereditary
information from generation to generation. (1 point)
Description (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Plasmids are small extrachromosomal, circular DNA molecules that may enhance
survival.
Plasmids are circular bits of DNA that are distinct from the chromosomal
DNA and replicate independently. Plasmids may provide bacteria with
genetic advantages like antibiotic resistance that enhance survival,
growth, and reproduction.
(b) Identify the protocol the scientist likely used to encourage the
uptake of the plasmid DNA. (1 point)
