 the aorta and inferior vena
cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into
segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries.
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is made up
of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are
found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of
blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.
There are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular reabsorption,
which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.

Many systems have evolved for excreting wastes that are simpler than the
