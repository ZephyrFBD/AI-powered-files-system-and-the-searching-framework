Because cholesteric liquid crystal displays can be built 
that draw very little power, they are also being investigated for use in electronic 
paper (Figure 11.34). Such applications are possible because an applied electrical 
field changes the orientation of liquid crystal molecules and thus affects the optical 
properties of the device.
▲ Figure 11.34 Electronic paper (e-paper) 
based on cholesteric liquid crystal technology. 
Electronic paper mimics the appearance of 
ordinary ink on paper (like a page of a book 
or magazine). It has numerous potential uses 
including thin displays on walls, electronic 
labels, and electronic book readers.
*Cholesteric liquid crystals are sometimes called chiral nematic phases because the molecules 
within each plane adopt an arrangement similar to a nematic liquid crystal.
