read and write but can you do addition and subtraction? 
 
 I can, Mr. McCaffrey. 
 
 Well, I don’t know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to 
 
  
  
 ring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is 
 
 clear,McCourt.A good fist.We’ll take you on pending the decision on 
 
 the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station. 
 
 In the morning? 
 
 In the morning.We don’t give out the bloody morning papers at 
 
 night, do we? 
 
 No,Mr. McCaffrey. 
 
 Another thing.We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run 
 
 by the freemasons in Dublin.We pick it up at the railway station.We 
 
 count it.We take it to the newsagents. But we don’t read it. I don’t want 
 
 to see you reading it.You could lose the Faith and by the look of those 
 
 eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me,McCourt? 
 
 I do,Mr. McCaffrey. 
 
 No Irish Times, and when you come in next week I’ll tell you about 
 
 all the English filth you’re not to read
