(The symbol 
means infinitely far away.) Notice that the potential V
decreases with the first power of the distance, whereas the electric field (Eq. 16–4)
decreases as the square of the distance. The potential near a positive charge is large
and positive, and it decreases toward zero at very large distances, Fig. 17–9a. The
potential near a negative charge is negative and increases toward zero at large
distances, Fig. 17–9b. Equation 17–5 is sometimes called the Coulomb potential
(it has its origin in Coulomb’s law).
