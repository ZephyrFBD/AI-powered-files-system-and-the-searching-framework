Which of these structures would most eﬀectively filter water
moving through the plant?
Angiosperm vascular tissue would be more eﬀective because
water can travel rapidly through these tissues, making it
more eﬀicient to use.
(A)
Gymnosperm vascular tissue would be more eﬀective
because the water frequently moves from one cell to another
through the vessel walls, which act as a filter.
(B)
Angiosperm and gymnosperm vascular tissue would be
equally eﬀective in filtration because water travels over the
same distance in both cases.
(C)
It is impossible to determine which would make the better
filter without knowing whether the
