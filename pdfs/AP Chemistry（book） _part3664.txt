oride ligands occupy adjacent vertices of the octa-
hedral arrangement. In trans@3Co(NH3)4Cl24+ the two chlorides are opposite each other. 
It is this difference in positions of the Cl ligands that leads to two compounds, one violet 
and one green.
The insight Werner provided into the bonding in coordination compounds is even 
more remarkable when we realize that his theory predated Lewis’s ideas of covalent 
bonding by more than 20 years! Because of his tremendous contributions to coordina-
tion chemistry, Werner was awarded the 1913 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
