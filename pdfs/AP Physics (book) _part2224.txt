20–8 Ampère’s Law
The relation between the current in a long straight wire and the magnetic field it
produces is given by Eq. 20–6, Section 20–5. This equation is valid only for a long
straight wire. Is there a general relation between a current in a wire of any 
shape and the magnetic field around it? Yes: the French scientist André Marie 
Ampère (1775–1836) proposed such a relation shortly after Oersted’s discovery.
Consider any (arbitrary) closed path around a current, as shown in Fig. 20–30, and
imagine this path as being made up of short segments each of length 
We 
take the product of the length of each segment times the component of magnetic
field 
parallel to that segment. If we now sum all these terms, the result (accord-
ing to Ampère) will be equal to 
times the net current 
that passes through
the surface enclosed by the path. This is known as Ampère’s law and can be written
(20;9)
The symbol 
means “the sum of” and 
means the component of
