•  How does a change in ambient temperature affect the rate of transpiration in plants? 
•  How can the efficiency of transformation be calculated in bacteria exposed to  
plasmids containing a gene for antibiotic resistance?  
Problem solving involves a complex interplay among observation, theory, and 
inference. For example, say that for one of your investigations you explore a typical 
dihybrid genetic cross like one you may have studied earlier in an introductory 
biology course. This time, however, you collect data from the F2 generation, and note 
four different phenotype combinations (observation). You count the number of each 
combination. Using your understanding of the role of chromosomes in inheritance, 
you work to make a theoretical prediction of what your results might be assuming 
independent assortment of genes (hypothesis). However, you find that the observed 
results don’t quite match your expected results. Now what? You’ve been
