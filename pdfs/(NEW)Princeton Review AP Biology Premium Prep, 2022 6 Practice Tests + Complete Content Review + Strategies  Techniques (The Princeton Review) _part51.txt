in the effect of temperature on the respiration rate of crickets. Three chambers
were prepared and kept at three different temperatures. A cricket was placed in each chamber. The CO2 levels
in the chamber were recorded at 0 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes to assess the changing levels of CO2
over time. This process was repeated 50 times at each temperature. The results are indicated in Table 1.
Table 1. Levels of CO2 over time
(a) Describe how CO2 is a measure of respiration. Explain why temperature might affect the rate of respiration.
(b) On a set of axes, construct an appropriately labeled graph to demonstrate the CO2 levels with changing
temperature. Please include all temperatures, timepoints, and error bars.
(c) Identify which temperature led to having the highest respiration rate in the crickets.
(d) Predict what would happen to the CO2 levels in the crickets with an additional 5Â°C increase above the
highest temperature. Justify your prediction with evidence from the data.
