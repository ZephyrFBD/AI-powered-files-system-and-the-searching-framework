Science Practice
6.4: The student can make claims and predictions about 
natural phenomena based on scientific theories and 
models.
Learning Objective 
4.21: The student is able to predict consequences of 
human actions on both local and global ecosystems.
(A)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding of the human impact 
on ecosystems and correctly predicts that the loss of habitat from deforestation 
likely will lead to a loss of species diversity due to a decrease of available 
niches.
(B)
This option is incorrect. Destruction of the tropical rain forest does not increase 
soil moisture but rather it decreases soil moisture because there is less shade to 
retain dampness in deforested regions.
(C)
This option is incorrect. Accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does 
not affect ultraviolet penetration but rather contributes to the “greenhouse effect,” 
which absorbs reflected infrared radiation and re-reflects some of it back toward 
Earth, thus war
