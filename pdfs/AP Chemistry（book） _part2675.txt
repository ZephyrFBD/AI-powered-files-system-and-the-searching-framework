ringly soluble salt dissolves in 
water.
 17.5 ▶  Factors That Affect Solubility  
Investigate some of the factors that affect 
solubility, including the common-ion effect 
and the effect of acids.
 17.6 ▶  Precipitation and Separation of 
Ions Learn how differences in solubility 
can be used to separate ions through 
selective precipitation.
 17.7 ▶  Qualitative Analysis for Metallic 
Elements Realize that the principles of 
solubility and complexation equilibria can 
be used to identify ions in solution.
WHAT’S AHEAD
To understand the chemistry that underlies coral reef formation and other processes 
in the ocean and in aqueous systems such as living cells, we must understand the con-
cepts of aqueous equilibria. In this chapter, we take a step toward understanding such 
complex solutions by looking first at further applications of acid–base equilibria. The 
idea is to consider not only solutions in which there is a single solute but also those con-
taining a mixture of solutes. We t
