further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint. The
shape of the joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint (Figure 29.26). These joints can be described as
planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, or ball-and-socket joints.

Figure 29.26 Different types of joints allow different types of movement. Planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and
ball-and-socket are all types of synovial joints.
Planar Joints
Planar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces. These joints allow for gliding
movements, and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints. The range of motion is limited in these joints and
does not involve rotation. Planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as
between vertebrae (Figure 29.27).
