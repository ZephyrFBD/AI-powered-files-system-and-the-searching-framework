Diffusion can be readily understood on the basis of kinetic theory and the
random motion of molecules. Consider a tube of cross-sectional area A containing
molecules in a higher concentration on the left than on the right, Fig. 13â€“28.
We assume the molecules are in random motion. Yet there will be a net flow of
molecules to the right. To see why, let us consider the small section of tube 
of length 
as shown. Molecules from both regions 1 and 2 cross into this 
central section as a result of their random motion. The more molecules there are
in a region, the more will strike a given area or cross a boundary. Since there is a
greater concentration of molecules in region 1 than in region 2, more molecules
cross into the central section from region 1 than from region 2. There is, then, a net
flow of molecules from left to right, from high concentration 
toward low
concentration 
The net flow becomes zero only when the concentrations
become equal.
We might expect that the
