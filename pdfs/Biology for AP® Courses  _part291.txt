A fat molecule consists of two main components—glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with
three carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a
carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “fatty acid.” The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36;
most common are those containing 12–18 carbons. In a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons
of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (Figure 3.14).
