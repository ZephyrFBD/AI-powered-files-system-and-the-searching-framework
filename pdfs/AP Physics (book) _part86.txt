ter was again redefined, this time in terms of the
speed of light (whose best measured value in terms of the older definition of the
meter was 
with an uncertainty of 
). The new definition
reads: “The meter is the length of path traveled by light in vacuum during a
time interval of 
of a second.”‡
British units of length (inch, foot, mile) are now defined in terms of the
meter. The inch (in.) is defined as exactly 2.54 centimeters (cm;
).
Other conversion factors are given in the Table on the inside of the front cover
of this book. Table 1–1 presents some typical lengths, from very small to very
large, rounded off to the nearest power of 10. See also Fig. 1–8. [Note that the
abbreviation for inches (in.) is the only one with a period, to distinguish it from
the word “in”.]
Time
The standard unit of time is the second (s). For many years, the second was
defined as 
of a mean solar day
The standard second is now defined more precisely in terms of
the frequency of radiation emitted by ce
