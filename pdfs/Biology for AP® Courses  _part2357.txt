Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria (Figure 21.9). When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the
production of new virions, the infection is said to be productive. If the virions are released by bursting the cell, the virus
replicates by means of a lytic cycle (Figure 21.10). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which infects Escherichia
coli found in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without being released. For
example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle (Figure 21.10),
and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host
cell genome, it is called a prophage. An examp
