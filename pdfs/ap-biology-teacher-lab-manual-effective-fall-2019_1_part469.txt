phase (G2). In G2, the cell prepares to divide. In mitosis, the duplicated 
chromosomes are separated into two nuclei. In most cases, mitosis is followed by 
cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides and organelles separate into daughter cells. 
This type of cell division is asexual and important for growth, renewal, and repair of 
multicellular organisms.
