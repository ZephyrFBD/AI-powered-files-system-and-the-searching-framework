Both oncogenes and tumor suppressors can cause cancer, but oncogenes do
it by stepping on the cell cycle gas pedal, while tumor suppressors do it by
removing the brake pedal.
Cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis have been intimately linked with cancer. In order for a normal cell to become a
cancer cell, it must override cell cycle checkpoints and grow in an unregulated way. It must also avoid cell death.
Tumors often accumulate DNA damage. Cancer treatments target these changes, because they are what make a
cancer cell different from a normal cell.
Letâ€™s recap:
The cell cycle consists of two things: interphase and mitosis.
During the S phase of interphase, the chromosomes replicate via DNA replication.
Growth and preparation for mitosis occur during the G1 and G2 stages of interphase.
Cell cycle checkpoints make sure the cell is ready to continue through the cell cycle.
CDK and cyclin proteins work together to promote cell cycle progression.
Oncogenes promote cell gr
