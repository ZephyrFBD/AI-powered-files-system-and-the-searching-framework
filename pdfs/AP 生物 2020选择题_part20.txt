of DMSP 
produced by juvenile and adult coral and their symbionts under normal and thermally stressed conditions. The data 
are shown in the graphs in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: DMSP concentration in juvenile and adult corals and their symbionts in normal and thermally-stressed 
conditions. Error bars represent ±2SEx. 
The researchers also measured the density of the symbiont as well as the photosynthetic yield in adult corals at the 
two temperatures. Photosynthetic yield is an index measure of energy output compared to sunlight energy input in 
which larger photosynthetic yield values represent photosynthetic organisms producing more energy.

thermally-stressed conditions. Error bars represent ±2SEx.

symbionts?
