g of ions and diffusion of
ions to create ATP is chemiosmosis.
Brown fat, which is found in newborns and hibernating mammals, can also use
the hydrogen gradient generated from the electron transport chain to generate
heat. This occurs when they decouple the chemiosmosis from oxidative
phosphorylation.
These hydrogen ions can diffuse across the inner membrane only by passing through channels called ATP synthase.
Meanwhile, ADP and Pi are on the other side of these protein channels. The flow of protons through these channels
produces ATP by combining ADP and Pi on the matrix side of the channel. Overall, this process is called oxidative
phosphorylation because when electrons are given up it is called “oxidation” and then ADP is “phosphorylated” to
make ATP.
You’re also expected to know the following two things for the AP Biology Exam:
Every NADH from glycolysis yields 1.5 ATP and all other NADH molecules yield 2.5 ATP.
Every FADH2 yields 1.5 ATP.
