ressure of the water is 0.80 torr 
and the total pressure of the air is 735 torr?
Sample Exercise 18.1 
Calculating Concentration from Partial Pressure
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the partial pressure of water vapor and the 
total pressure of an air sample and asked to determine the water 
vapor concentration.
Plan Recall that the partial pressure of a component in a mixture 
of gases is given by the product of its mole fraction and the total 
pressure of the mixture 
 (Section 10.6):
P
H2O = XH2OP
t
Solve Solving for the mole fraction of water vapor in the mixture, 
XH2O, gives
XH2O =
P
H2O
P
t
= 0.80 torr
735 torr = 0.0011
The concentration in ppm is the mole fraction times 106:
0.0011 * 106 = 1100 ppm

From the data in Table 18.1, the partial pressure of argon in 
dry air at an atmospheric pressure of 668 mm Hg is  
(a) 3.12 mm Hg, (b) 7.09 mm Hg, (c) 6.24 mm Hg,  
(d) 9.34 mm Hg, (e) 39.9 mm Hg.
