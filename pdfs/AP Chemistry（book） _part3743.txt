How many unpaired electrons do you predict for the tetrahe-
dral 3MnCl442 -  ion?  
(a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, (e) 5.

Are there any diamagnetic tetrahedral complexes containing 
transition metal ions with partially filled d orbitals? If so 
what electron count(s) leads to diamagnetism?
Crystal-field theory can be used to explain many observations in addition to those we 
have discussed. The theory is based on electrostatic interactions between ions and atoms, 
which essentially means ionic bonds. Many lines of evidence show, however, that the 
bonding in complexes must have some covalent character. Therefore, molecular-orbital 
theory 
 (Sections 9.7 and 9.8) can also be used to describe the bonding in complexes, 
but the application of molecular-orbital theory to coordination compounds is beyond the 
scope of our discussion. Crystal-field theory, although not entirely accurate in all details,
