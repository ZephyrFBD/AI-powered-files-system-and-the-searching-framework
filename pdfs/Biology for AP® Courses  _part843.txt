ate dehydrogenase (LDH). The reaction can proceed in either direction, but the
reaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions. Such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause
muscle stiffness, fatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis. Once the lactic acid has been
removed from the muscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for
energy.

Figure 7.15 Lactic acid fermentation is common in muscle cells that have run out of oxygen.
Tremetol, a metabolic poison found in the white snake root plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate. When
cows eat this plant, it is concentrated in the milk they produce. Humans who consume the milk become
ill. Symptoms of this disease, which include vomiting, abdominal pain, and tremors, become worse after
exercise. Why do you thin
