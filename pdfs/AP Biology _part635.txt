food moves to the esophagus and then to the crop where it is stored.
Posterior to the crop, the gizzard, which consists of thick, muscular walls,
grinds up the food with the help of sand and soil that were ingested along
with the organic matter. The rest of the digestive tract consists of the
intestines where chemical digestion and absorption occur. Absorption is
enhanced by the presence of a large fold in the upper surface of the
intestine, called the typhlosole, which greatly increases the surface area of
the intestine.
STUDY TIP
Organs work together to do one job. One example of this is digestion.
Grasshopper
Like the earthworm, the grasshopper has a digestive tract that consists of
a long tube consisting of a crop and gizzard. However, there are several
differences. The grasshopper has specialized mouth parts for tasting,
biting, and crushing food and has a gizzard that contains plates made of
chitin that help in grinding the food. In addition, in the grasshopper, the
