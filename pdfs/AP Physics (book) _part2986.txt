ed v to the left, will see the two events as simultaneous?
Explain in detail, drawing diagrams equivalent to Fig. 26–5.
[Hint: Include length contraction.]
3. Using Example 26–2 as a guide, show that for objects that
move slowly in comparison to c, the length contraction
formula is roughly 
Use this approxi-
mation to find the “length shortening”
of the
train in Example 26–6 if the train travels at 
(rather than 0.92c).

4. In Example 26–5, the spaceship is moving at 0.90c in the
horizontal direction relative to an observer on the Earth.
If instead the spaceship moved at 0.90c directed at 
above the horizontal, what would be the painting’s
dimensions as seen by the observer on Earth?
5. Protons from outer space crash into the Earth’s atmosphere
at a high rate. These protons create particles that eventually
decay into other particles called muons. This cosmic debris
travels through the atmosphere. Every second, doze
