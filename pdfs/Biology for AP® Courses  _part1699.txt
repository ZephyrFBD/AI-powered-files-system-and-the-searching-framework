late comprising two consensus

and a Ïƒ protein that assists only with initiation. Elongation synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of 40
nucleotides per second. Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs either by rho protein interaction or by the formation
of an mRNA hairpin.
15.3 Eukaryotic Transcription
Transcription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of polymerases, depending on the gene being transcribed. RNA
polymerase II transcribes all of the protein-coding genes, whereas RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNA genes, and RNA
polymerase III transcribes rRNA, tRNA, and small nuclear RNA genes. The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes
involves the binding of several transcription factors to complex promoter sequences that are usually located upstream of
the gene being copied. The mRNA is synthesized in the 5' t
