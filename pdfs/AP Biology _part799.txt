expression
of some genes.
(C) Notice that, in this experiment, Jost did not perform surgery on
the control group. In an experiment, the control group and the
experimental group must be identical in everything except for the
one variable being tested. In this instance, that was not quite the
case. Sham surgeries are often carried out in experiments on animals
to fulfill that requirement.
(C) LH levels spike just before ovulation and as the uterine lining
continues to thicken. Then, it just as suddenly decreases. Choice A is
incorrect because the uterine lining is not shed until much after
ovulation when LH levels are at their pre-spike levels. The follicle
matures from day 1 to day 12 without the help of LH, so choice B is
not correct. Choice D is incorrect because the level of LH decreases

(C) Choice (A) is not correct because in females, egg production
begins with one mitotic cell division followed by two meiotic cell
divisions. Choice
