hoice (B) is also incorrect.
13. (B) Distilled water contains no enzyme, so it would be an appropriate control. Choice (A) is incorrect because
changing the size of the paper disk would add another variable. Reducing the temperature of the hydrogen
peroxide would not be an appropriate control, so choice (C) is incorrect. Pureeing the potatoes with buffer
instead of water would change the conditions of the experiment and would not be a control, so choice (D) is
incorrect.
14. (C) The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for 9% hydrogen peroxide (30.9 + 2(3.9) = 37.8 sec)
overlaps with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for 6% hydrogen peroxide (45 â€“ 2(4.3) = 36.4 sec).
So it is not likely there is a statistically significant difference between those two concentrations of hydrogen
peroxide. The 95% confidence intervals for all of the other pairs of hydrogen peroxide do not overlap and
therefore are more likely to have a statistically significant difference between them.
