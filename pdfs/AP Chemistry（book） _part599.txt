are not oxidized by H+, Cu 
does not react with HCl(aq). Interestingly, copper does react with nitric acid, as shown 
in Figure 1.11, but the reaction is not oxidation of Cu by H+ ions. Instead, the metal is 
oxidized to Cu2+ by the nitrate ion, accompanied by the formation of brown nitrogen 
dioxide, NO21g2:
 
Cu1s2 + 4 HNO31aq2 ¡ Cu1NO3221aq2 + 2 H2O1l2 + 2 NO21g2 
[4.30]
As the copper is oxidized in this reaction, NO3
-, where the oxidation number of 
nitrogen is +5, is reduced to NO2, where the oxidation number of nitrogen is +4. We will 
examine reactions of this type in Chapter 20.
