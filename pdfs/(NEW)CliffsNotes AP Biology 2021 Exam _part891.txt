 then packaged in vesicles that may travel to the plasma membrane, merge with it, and release the modified
molecules to the outside. Some vesicles may remain in the cell for other purposes. Some lysosomes originate in this
fashion.
57. C. PCR is a process that makes multiple copies of a specific DNA fragment in a very short amount of time.
58. A. Heating the double-stranded DNA fragment to about 95°C causes the DNA to “melt,” or separate into two
strands of single-stranded DNA.
59. A. In Step II, primers (short single-stranded DNA molecules) are added and the temperature is reduced. The
primers attach to the singlestranded DNA fragment to be copied.
60. B. Once the primers are in place (Step II in the figure), a heat-stable DNA polymerase is added. DNA
polymerase attaches to the primers and begins replication of the DNA fragment.
61. B. An antigen is any substance identified as foreign to the body. Antibody production at day 5 is in response to
an antigen. 62. A. Antibodies are produce
