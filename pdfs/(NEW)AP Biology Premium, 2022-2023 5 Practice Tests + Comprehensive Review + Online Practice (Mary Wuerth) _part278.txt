res to Mitosis
Table 12.1 summarizes the similarities and differences between mitosis and meiosis.
Table 12.1 Mitosis vs. Meiosis
 
Mitosis
Meiosis
Purpose
Reproduction in asexually reproducing organisms;
growth; repair
Reproduction in sexually
reproducing organisms
DNA Replication
Occurs once (before the start of mitosis)
Occurs once (before the start of
meiosis I)
Cell Division
One round
Two rounds
Result
Two genetically identical, diploid somatic cells
Four genetically different, haploid
gametes
How Meiosis Generates Genetic Diversity
Meiosis generates genetic diversity in multiple ways. In the prophase I stage of meiosis, homologous chromosomes
pair up in a process called synapsis to form tetrads.
TIP
To recall the meaning of tetrad, remember that the prefix tetra- means “four.” During synapsis, two homologous chromosomes (with two
chromatids each) pair up. This tetrad has four chromatids.
Once the tetrads are formed, homologous chromosomes may exchange genetic information through
