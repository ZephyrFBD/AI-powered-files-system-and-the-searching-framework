. Continue breaking 
toothpicks for these total time intervals (60, 120, and 180 seconds). Students then graph 
the number of toothpicks broken versus time (10, 20, 30, 60, 120, and 180Â seconds).

Graph and Switch 
Have students perform a yeast fermentation lab using the sucrose solutions from 
the Diffusion and Osmosis Lab your students may have performed in Unit 2. Students 
can measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced as the dependent variable. At the 
conclusion of the lab, collect class data. Have students graph the class data, including 
error bars on their graphs. To enhance this activity, have students test different kinds of 
fresh and processed fruit juices and then compare the rates of fermentation among the 
different solutions.

Using one of many available online resources, have students learn about the work 
of Peter and Rosemary Grant. Using data from their work, help students to build 
their graphing and statistical analysis skills. A
