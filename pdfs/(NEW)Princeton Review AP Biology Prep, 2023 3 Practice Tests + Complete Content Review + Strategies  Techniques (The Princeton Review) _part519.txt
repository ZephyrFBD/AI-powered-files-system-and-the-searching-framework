This lab demonstrates how an enzyme catalyzes a reaction and what can influence rates of catalysis. In this lab, the
enzyme peroxidase is used to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.
H2O2 + peroxidase → 2H2O + O2 + peroxidase
The following are the major concepts you need to understand for the AP Exam:
Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of biological reactions. They accomplish this by lowering the
activation energy of the reaction.
Enzymes have active sites, which are pockets that the substrates (reactants) can enter that are specific to one
substrate or set of substrates.
Enzymes have optimal temperature and pH ranges at which they catalyze reactions. Enzyme concentration and
substrate concentration can also influence the rates of reaction.
If you’re asked to design an experiment to measure the effect of these four variables on enzyme activity, keep
all the conditions constant except for the variable of interest. For example, to measure the effe
