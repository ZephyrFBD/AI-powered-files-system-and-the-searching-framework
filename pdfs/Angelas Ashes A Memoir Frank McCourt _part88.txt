ads but they 
 
 don’t hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and 
 
 when Dad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they 
 
 just nod again. 
 
 Grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages 
 
 and tea.The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his 
 
 spoon at the aunts and asks their names again.When Mam tells him eat 
 
 his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches 
 
 49 
 
 over to comfort him. She says,There, there, and I wonder why everyone 
 
 says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there 
 
 means. 
 
 It’s quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. 
 
 Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt 
 
 is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now. 
 
 Dad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don’t know what you’re 
 
 going to do,Malachy.Things are worse here than they are in America. 
 
 No work
