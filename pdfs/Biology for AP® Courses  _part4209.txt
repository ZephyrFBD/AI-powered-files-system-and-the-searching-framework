Savannas
Savannas are grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in Africa, South America, and northern Australia (Figure
35.12). Savannas are hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 °C to 29 °C (75 °F to 84 °F) and an annual
rainfall of 10–40 cm (3.9–15.7 in). Savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as
well as they do in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes). As a result, within the grasses and forbs (herbaceous
flowering plants) that dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees (Figure 35.14). Since fire is an important source
of disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly re-sprout after a
