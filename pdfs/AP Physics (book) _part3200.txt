28. Why does the cutoff wavelength in Fig. 28–11 imply a
photon nature for light?
29. Why do we not expect perfect agreement between meas-
ured values of characteristic X-ray line wavelengths and
those calculated using the Bohr model, as in Example 28–7?
30. How would you figure out which lines in an X-ray spec-
trum correspond to 
etc., transitions?
