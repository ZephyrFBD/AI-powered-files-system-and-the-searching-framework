Connection for AP® Courses
As we learned in Chapter 7, all living organisms, from simple bacteria to complex plants and animals, require free
energy to carry out cellular processes, such as growth and reproduction. Organisms use various strategies to capture,
store, transform, and transfer free energy, including photosynthesis. Photosynthesis allows organisms to access enormous
amounts of free energy from the sun and transform it to the chemical energy of sugars. Although all organisms carry out
some form of cellular respiration, only certain organisms, called photo
