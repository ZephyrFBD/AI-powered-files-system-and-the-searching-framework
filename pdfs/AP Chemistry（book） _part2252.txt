elementary reaction in this mechanism.
(b) Write the equation for the overall reaction.
(c) Identify the intermediate(s).
Sample Exercise 14.12
 Determining Molecularity and Identifying Intermediates
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a two-step mechanism and asked for (a) the 
molecularities of each of the two elementary reactions, (b) the 
equation for the overall process, and (c) the intermediate.
Plan The molecularity of each elementary reaction depends on 
the number of reactant molecules in the equation for that reac-
tion. The overall equation is the sum of the equations for the ele-
mentary reactions. The intermediate is a substance formed in one 
step of the mechanism and used in another and therefore not part 
of the equation for the overall reaction.
Solve
(a) The Ô¨Årst elementary reaction involves a single reactant and 
is consequently unimolecular. The second reaction, which 
involves two reactant molecules, is bimolecular.
(b) Adding the two elementary reactions gives
