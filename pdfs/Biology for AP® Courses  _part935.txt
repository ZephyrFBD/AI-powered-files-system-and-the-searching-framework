crests or two troughs) along the wave.
Visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars. Scientists
differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic
spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation (Figure 8.11). The difference between wavelengths relates to
the amount of energy carried by them.

Figure 8.11 The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists at different
wavelengths, each of which has its own characteristic energy. All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is
characterized by its wavelength.
Each type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength. The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched
out it appears in the diagram), the less energy is carried. Short, tight waves carry the most energy. Thi
