e examine in detail the mathematics of relating quantities in one inertial
reference frame to the equivalent quantities in another. In particular, we
will see how positions and velocities transform (that is, change) from
one frame of reference to the other.
We begin with the classical, or Galilean, viewpoint. Consider two inertial ref-
erence frames S and 
which are each characterized by a set of coordinate axes,
Fig.E–1. The axes x and y (z is not shown) refer to S, and 
and 
refer to 
The
and x axes overlap one another, and we assume that fr
