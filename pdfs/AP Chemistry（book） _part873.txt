(a) Using this device, what measurements would you need to make 
to test your hypothesis? (b) What equations would you use in an-
alyzing your experiment? (c) Do you think you could obtain a rea-
sonable result from a single experiment? Why or why not? (d) In 
what way could the precision of your instruments affect the con-
clusions that you make? (e) List ways that you could modify the 
equipment to improve the data you obtain if you were performing 
this experiment today instead of 180 years ago. (f) Give an example 
of how you could demonstrate the relationship between heat and a 
form of energy other than mechanical work.
