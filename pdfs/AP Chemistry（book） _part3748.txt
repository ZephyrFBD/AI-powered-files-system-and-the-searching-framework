 three oxalate anions, as in part (b), is 5.0 * 109, and the equilibrium constant 
for formation of the cobalt(II) complex with three molecules of ortho-phenanthroline (Table 23.4) is 9 * 1019. From these 
results, what conclusions can you draw regarding the relative Lewis base properties of the two ligands toward cobalt(II)? (e) Using 
the approach described in Sample Exercise 17.14, calculate the concentration of free aqueous Co(II) ion in a solution initially 
containing 0.040 M oxalate (aq) and 0.0010 M Co2+(aq).
SOLUTION
(b) Because the oxalate ion has a charge of 2-, the net charge of 
a complex with three oxalate anions and one Co2+ ion is 4-. 
Therefore, the coordination compound has the formula:
(c) There is only one geometric isomer. The complex is chiral, 
however, in the same way the 3Co(en)343+ complex is chiral 
(Figure 23.22). The two mirror images are not superimposable, 
so there are two enantiomers:
4−
4−
(d) The ortho-phenanthroline ligand is bidentate, like the oxa-
