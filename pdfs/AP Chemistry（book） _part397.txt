quation for this reaction as
 
2 H2 + O2 ¡  2 H2O 
[3.1] 
We read the + sign as “reacts with” and the arrow as “produces.” The chemical for-
mulas to the left of the arrow represent the starting substances, called reactants. The 
chemical formulas to the right of the arrow represent substances produced in the reac-
tion, called products. The numbers in front of the formulas, called coefficients, indicate 
the relative numbers of molecules of each kind involved in the reaction. (As in algebraic 
equations, the coefficient 1 is usually not written.)
Because atoms are neither created nor destroyed in any reaction, a balanced chemical 
equation must have an equal number of atoms of each element on each side of the arrow. 
On the right side of Equation 3.1, for example, there are two molecules of H2O, each com-
posed of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen (Figure 3.2). Thus, 2 H2O (read 
“two molecules of water”) contains 2 * 2 = 4 H atoms and 2 * 1 = 2 O atoms. Notice 
that the nu
