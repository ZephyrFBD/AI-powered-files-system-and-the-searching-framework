he parent hydrocarbon is based on the longest con-
tinuous chain of carbon atoms. Branches are alkyl groups, named 
after the number of C atoms in the branch and located by count-
ing C atoms along the longest continuous chain.
Solve The longest continuous chain of C atoms extends from the 
upper left CH3 group to the lower left CH3 group and is seven C 
atoms long:
CH3
5CH2
6CH2
7CH3
4CH
2CH2
1CH3
CH3
3CH
The parent compound is thus heptane. There are two methyl 
groups branching off the main chain. Hence, this compound is 
a dimethylheptane. To specify the location of the two methyl 
groups, we must number the C atoms from the end that gives the 
lower two numbers to the carbons bearing side chains. This means 
that we should start numbering at the upper left carbon. There 
is a methyl group on C3 and one on C4. The compound is thus 
3,4-dimethylheptane.
