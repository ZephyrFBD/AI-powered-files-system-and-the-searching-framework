laboratories rely on inquiry, 
the greater the skill development of the students. To that end, students’ previous 
experiences solving problems and recording their work reflectively in a laboratory 
notebook are essential prelab skills.  
You will find that the investigation will go more smoothly if students are introduced 
early to Wisconsin Fast Plants and cabbage white butterfly larvae. Having students 
start, maintain, and record both plant and butterfly cultures through one life cycle, 
without using the organisms for experiments, will greatly facilitate successful 
completion of this investigation. (Figure 3 shows the butterfly life cycle.) The 
  
  
 
  
increased familiarity with the organisms will prompt students to ask questions 
during the research component. In addition to developing students’ familiarity with 
the organisms, thereby easing completion of the lab, rearing one generation of each 
culture generates excess offspring of both plants and animals — numbers that ar
