hand, triglycerides with trans double bonds (popularly called trans fats), have relatively linear fatty acids that are able to
pack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fats. In the human diet, trans fats are linked to an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease, so many food manufacturers have reduced or eliminated their use in recent years. In contrast
to unsaturated fats, triglycerides without double bonds between carbon atoms are called saturated fats, meaning that they
contain all the hydrogen atoms available. Saturated fats are a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin.

the molecule caused by the cis configuration.
Enantiomers
Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional
placement of
