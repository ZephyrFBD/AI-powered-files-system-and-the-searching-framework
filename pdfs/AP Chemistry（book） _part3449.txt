 constant independent of temperature, is 
the time needed for one-half of the nuclei to decay. Some radioiso-
topes can be used to date objects; 14C, for example, is used to date 
organic objects. Geiger counters and scintillation counters count 
the emissions from radioactive samples. The ease of detection of 
radioisotopes also permits their use as radiotracers to follow ele-
ments through reactions.
ENERGY CHANGES IN NUCLEAR REACTIONS (SECTION 21.6)  
The energy produced in nuclear reactions is accompanied by 
measurable changes of mass in accordance with Einstein’s rela-
tionship, ∆E = c2∆m. The difference in mass between nuclei and 
the nucleons of which they are composed is known as the mass 
defect. The mass defect of a nuclide makes it possible to calculate 
its nuclear binding energy, the energy required to separate the nu-
cleus into individual nucleons. Because of trends in the nuclear 
binding energy with atomic number, energy is produced when 
heavy nuclei split (fission)
