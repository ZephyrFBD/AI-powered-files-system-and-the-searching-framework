(b) Write the half-reactions that occur in the two half-cells. 
(c) Which electrode is the anode, and which is the cathode? 
(d) Indicate the signs of the electrodes. (e) Do electrons 
ﬂow from the silver electrode to the iron electrode or from 
the iron to the silver? (f) In which directions do the cations 
and anions migrate through the solution?
 20.30  A voltaic cell similar to that shown in Figure 20.5 is con-
structed. One half-cell consists of an aluminum strip placed 
in a solution of Al1NO323, and the other has a nickel strip 
placed in a solution of NiSO4. The overall cell reaction is
2 Al1s2 + 3 Ni2+1aq2 ¡ 2 Al3+1aq2 + 3 Ni1s2
