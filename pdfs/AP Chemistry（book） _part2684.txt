= 3F-4
This F- concentration is substantially smaller than it would be 
in a 0.20 M solution of HF with no added HCl. The common 
ion, H+, suppresses the ionization of HF. The concentration of 
H+1aq2 is:
3H+4 = 10.10 + x2 M ≃0.10 M
Thus,
pH = 1.00
Comment Notice that for all practical purposes, the hydrogen ion 
concentration is due entirely to the HCl; the HF makes a negligible 
contribution by comparison.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Calculate the concentration of the lactate ion in a solu-
tion that is 0.100 M in lactic acid 1CH3CH(OH2COOH, 
pKa = 3.86) and 0.080 M in HCl.
(a) 4.83 M    (b) 0.0800 M 
(c) 7.3 * 10-3 M (d) 3.65 * 10-3 M 
(e) 1.73 * 10-4 M
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the formate ion concentration and pH of a solution 
that is 0.050 M in formic acid 1HCOOH, Ka = 1.8 * 10-42 
and 0.10 M in HNO3.
