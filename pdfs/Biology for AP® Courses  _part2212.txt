Mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) were
collected from a one-acre tract of lodge pole pine trees
(Pinus contorta) in a region of British Columbia where the
forests are under temperature stress. The beetles were
crushed, and a cellulase enzyme was extracted. Three
polymorphs of the enzyme were observed when separated
by gel electrophoresis. The three proteins observed
correspond to alleles labeled C1, C2, and C3. The numbers
of beetles with each allele are shown in the following
table.
