nt environmental conditions. You can
examine the behavior of fruit flies by placing them in an apparatus called
a choice chamber, which presents two (or more) choices to the fruit flies.
Experiments performed in the choice chamber will investigate
chemotaxis (movement in response to a chemical stimulus), geotaxis
(movement in response to gravity), and/or phototaxis (movement in
response to light). Fruit flies that move toward a stimulus exhibit positive
taxis (attract), whereas fruit flies that move away from a stimulus exhibit
negative taxis (repel). Undirected, random movement in response to an
external stimulus is kinesis.
You will design a controlled experiment to explore environmental factors
that trigger fruit fly responses. A simple choice chamber may be
constructed by joining together two clear plastic bottles with the bottoms
cut oﬀ. Aȇer exposing fruit flies in the chamber to a stimulus (one end) or
stimuli (both ends), give them time to respond and then determine the
number
