cal temperature.
The critical temperature is the highest temperature at which a liquid can exist. 
Above the critical temperature, the kinetic energies of the molecules are greater than

Vaporization—temperature 
does not change until all 
H2O(l) becomes H2O(g).
Melting—temperature does 
not change until all H2O(s) 
becomes H2O(l).

1.00 mol of H2O is heated from H2O1s2 at -25 °C to H2O1g2 at 
125 °C at a constant pressure of 1 atm. Even though heat is being 
added continuously, the system temperature does not change during 
the two phase changes (red lines).

Give It Some Thought
Why are the critical temperature and pressure for H2O so much higher than those 
for H2S, a related substance (Tabl
