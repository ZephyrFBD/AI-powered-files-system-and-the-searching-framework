42. Many endemic species are found in areas that are
geographically isolated. Suggest a plausible scientific
explanation why this is so.
a.
Geographically isolated areas have provided
high temperature conditions for certain species
to evolve. Over time, these species retained their
unique characteristics because they remained
separated from other species.
b.
Geographically isolated areas have provided a
unique environment for certain species to
evolve. Over time, these species retained their
unique characteristics because they remained
separated from other species.
c.
Certain species are introduced into some
geographically isolated areas, which provide
them unique environments. Over time, these
species retained their unique characteristics
because they remained separated from other
species.
d.
A unique environment is provided for certain
species to evolve in vitro and these species are
introduced into geographically isolated areas.
Over time, th
