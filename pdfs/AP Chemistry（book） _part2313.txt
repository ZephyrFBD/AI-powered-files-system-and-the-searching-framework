green ones element B, and the blue ones element C. (a) 
Write the equation for the net reaction that is occurring. 
(b) Identify the intermediate. (c) Identify the catalyst. 
[Sections 14.6 and 14.7]
 14.16 Draw a graph showing the reaction pathway for an over-
all exothermic reaction with two intermediates that are 
produced at different rates. On your graph indicate the 
reactants, products, intermediates, transition states, and 
activation energies. [Sections 14.6 and 14.7]
Reaction Rates (Sections 14.1 and 14.2)
 14.17 (a) What is meant by the term reaction rate? (b) Name 
three factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reac-
tion. (c) Is the rate of disappearance of reactants always 
the same as the rate of appearance of products?
 14.18 (a) What are the units usually used to express the rates of 
reactions occurring in solution? (b) As the temperature 
increases, does the reaction rate increase or decrease? 
 
(c) As a reaction proceeds, does the instantaneous re
