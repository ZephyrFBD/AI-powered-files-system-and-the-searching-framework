o calories. 
 
(c) When the automobile brakes to a stop is the “lost” kinetic 
energy converted mostly to heat or to some form of potential 
energy?
 1.26  (a) A baseball weighs 5.13 oz. What is the kinetic energy, in 
joules, of this baseball when it is thrown by a major league 
pitcher at 95.0 mi/h? (b) By what factor will the kinetic 
energy change if the speed of the baseball is decreased to 
 
55.0 mi/h? (c) What happens to the kinetic energy when the 
baseball is caught by the catcher? Is it converted mostly to 
heat or to some form of potential energy?
 1.27  Two positively charged particles are first brought close to-
gether and then released. Once released, the repulsion be-
tween particles causes them to move away from each other. 
(a) This is an example of potential energy being converted 
into what form of energy? (b) Does the potential energy of 
the two particles prior to release increase or decrease as the 
distance between them is increased.
