n in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present
outside the nucleus.
Some cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself. Cellular processes such as
gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off
gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms
could not. Therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass
this new development to offspring.
