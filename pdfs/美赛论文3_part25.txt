ese stages as follows:
(1) The process of adding Water
This stage can be divided into two processes which happen in the same time: The
flow of water and the transfer of heat.
The condition in the beginning of this stage is that the temperature of the water in
the bathtub is
2
u ，so by using the two sets of equations above, we can get the
distribution of water temperature in the bathtub at any time. Assuming the time of this
process is 1
t , and the temperature at the end of this process is
3
u , and
3
3( , , )
u
u x y z

,
which means that it is a function about the distribution of the temperature in space.
(2) The process of fusion
The beginning of this stage is also the end of the process of adding water. At this
very moment, the temperature of every part of the water in the bathtub is influenced
by the adding water, but this stage is a natural process of water fusion. Regarding
3
u
as the original state, we can get the temperature of every point in the development of
this process b
