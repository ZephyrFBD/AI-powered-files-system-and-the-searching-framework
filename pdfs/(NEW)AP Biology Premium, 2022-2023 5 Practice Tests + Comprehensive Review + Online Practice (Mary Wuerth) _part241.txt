creased reabsorption of water by the kidneys
(D) increased hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose
3. How do small ligands move between plant cells?
(A) Receptor proteins on plant cell membranes transport the ligands.
(B) Ligands pass through plasmodesmata that connect plant cells.
(C) Ligands can pass through the plant cell membrane unassisted.
(D) Active transport transfers ligands across the plant cell wall.
4. How do growth factors stimulate cell division?
(A) Growth factors bind to multiple cells, grouping them in multicellular structures.
(B) Growth factors bind to cyclic AMP, removing it from the cytosol.
(C) Growth factors bind to cell membrane receptors, triggering a signal transduction pathway.
(D) Growth factors bind to cell membrane phospholipids, which results in increased cell division.
5. In some autoimmune disorders, the body produces antibodies that bind to cell surface receptors on target cells,
blocking them from interacting with other molecules. Which of the following is
