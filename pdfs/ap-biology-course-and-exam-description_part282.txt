Have students design 
an experiment to test 
a hypothesis about an 
observation. They should 
identify the needed 
controls and develop an 
experimental protocol to 
collect the data. After the 
experiment, students should 
analyze their data and draw 
conclusions from the results 
that relate to a biological 
concept or process. Finally, 
students should describe the 
limitations of the investigation 
and their conclusions.

Science Practice 3: Determine scientific questions and methods.
To provide deeper understanding of the concepts, 
students should be able to pose, refine, and evaluate 
scientific questions about natural phenomena and 
investigate answers through experimentation, research, 
and information gathering and discussion. Suppose a 
student poses the question: “What happens to the rate 
of photosynthesis at very high temperatures?” This 
quest
