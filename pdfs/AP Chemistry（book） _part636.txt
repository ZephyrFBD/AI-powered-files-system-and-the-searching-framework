us to rank metals according to their 
ease of oxidation. A list of metals arranged in order of decreasing ease 
of oxidation is called an activity series. Any metal on the list can be 
oxidized by ions of metals 1or H+2 below it in the series.
CONCENTRATIONS OF SOLUTIONS (SECTION 4.5) The concentra-
tion of a solution expresses the amount of a solute dissolved in the 
solution. One of the common ways to express the concentration of a 
solute is in terms of molarity. The molarity of a solution is the number 
of moles of solute per liter of solution. Molarity makes it possible to 
interconvert solution volume and number of moles of solute. If the 
solute is a liquid, its density can be used in molarity calculations to 
convert between mass, volume, and moles. Solutions of known mo-
larity can be formed either by weighing out the solute and diluting it 
to a known volume or by the dilution of a more concentrated solution 
of known concentration (a stock solution). Adding solvent to the
