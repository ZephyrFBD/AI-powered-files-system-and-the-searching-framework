ence, it separates from the
DNA template, completing the process of transcription. The new RNA is now a transcript or a copy of the sequence
of nucleotides based on the DNA strand. Note that the freshly synthesized RNA is complementary to the template
strand, but it is identical to the coding strand (with the substitution of uracil for thymine).
RNA Processing
In prokaryotes, the mRNA is now complete, but in eukaryotes the RNA must be processed before it can leave the
nucleus.
In eukaryotes, the freshly transcribed RNA is called an hnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear RNA) and it contains both
coding regions and noncoding regions. The regions that express the code that will be turned into protein are exons.
The noncoding regions in the mRNA are introns.
The introns—the intervening sequences—must be removed before the mRNA leaves the nucleus. This process,
called splicing, is accomplished by an RNA-protein complex called a spliceosome. This process produces a final
mRNA that is shorter than the
