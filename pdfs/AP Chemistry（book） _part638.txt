Key equations
t Molarity =
moles solute
volume of solution in liters         [4.31] 
Molarity is the most commonly used unit of concentration in 
chemistry.
t Mconc * Vconc = Mdil * Vdil               [4.33]
When adding solvent to a concentrated solution to make a dilute 
solution, molarities and volumes of both concentrated and dilute 
solutions can be calculated if three of the quantities are known.
