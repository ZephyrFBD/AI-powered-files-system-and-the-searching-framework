ertain forms of leukemia have a unique 
feature called a Philadelphia chromosome. Look at the photos of the karyotype of 
leukemia cells in Figure 7. 
•  What happens in a normal cell if the DNA has mutations? 
•  What would happen if cells with mutated DNA replicated? 
•  How do cells monitor DNA integrity? 
•  How are the chromosomes different in the cancer cells compared to normal cells? 
•  How could these differences lead to cancer?

■ Part 4: Modeling Meiosis 
Meiosis is a cell division resulting in the halving, or reduction, of chromosome number 
in each cell. A diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes (2n), while a haploid cell 
or organism has one set (1n). Meiosis produces gametes (ova and sperm) in animals and 
spores in fungi, plants, and protists. Three other important characteristics of mei
