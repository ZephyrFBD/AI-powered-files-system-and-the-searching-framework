cord as in Fig. 11–34, the frequency does not
change (although the wavelength and velocity do change).
Explain why.
21. Is energy always conserved when two waves interfere?
Explain.
22. If a string is vibrating as a standing wave in three loops,
are there any places you could touch it with a knife blade
without disturbing the motion?
23. Why do the strings used for the lowest-frequency notes on
a piano normally have wire wrapped around them?

24. When a standing wave exists on a string, the vibrations of
incident and reflected waves cancel at the nodes. Does this
mean that energy was destroyed? Explain.
25. Can the amplitude of the standing waves in Fig. 11–40 be
greater than the amplitude of the vibrations that cause them
(up and down motion of the hand)?
26. “In a round bowl of water, waves move from the center 
to the rim, or from the rim to the center, depending on
whether you strike at the center or at the rim.” So wrote
Dante Alighieri 700 years ago in his great poem Parad
