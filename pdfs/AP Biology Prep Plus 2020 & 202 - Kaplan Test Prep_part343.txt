lower substrate concentration and the turnover rate is higher
(A)
NADP+, because the reaction reaches maximum velocity at a
lower substrate concentration and the turnover rate is lower
(B)
NAD+, because the reaction reaches maximum velocity at a
lower substrate concentration and the turnover rate is higher
(C)
NAD+, because the reaction reaches maximum velocity at a
lower substrate concentration and the turnover rate is lower

3. In a recent study, researchers examined the eﬀects of an inhibitor
to determine how it aﬀected the activity of angiotensin I-
converting enzyme. On the graph below, the maximum velocity of
the reaction is represented by the y-intercept. The substrate
concentration at which the reaction proceeds at half-maximum
velocity is represented by the x-intercept.
Based on this data, is this a competitive inhibitor or a
noncompetitive inhibitor, and why?
