the heartâ€™s major function is the mechanical pumping of blood, it is 
most easily monitored by using the electrical impulses generated by 
tiny voltaic cells.
A voltaic cell is constructed with two hydrogen electrodes. Electrode 1 has PH2 = 1.00 atm and an unknown concentration of 
H+1aq2. Electrode 2 is a standard hydrogen electrode 1PH2 = 1.00 atm, 3H+4 = 1.00 M2. At 298 K the measured cell potential 
is 0.211 V, and the electrical current is observed to flow from electrode 1 through the external circuit to electrode 2. What is the 
pH of the solution at electrode 1?
Sample Exercise 20.13
Determining pH Using a Concentration Cell
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the potential of a concentration cell and the 
direction in which the current flows. We also have the concentra-
tions or partial pressures of all reactants and products except for 
3H+4 in half-cell 1, which is our unknown.
Plan We can use the Nernst equation to determine Q and then use 
Q to calculate the unknown concent
