our Solar
System. Estimate the fraction of the Solar System’s total
angular momentum that is possessed by planets using a
simplified model which includes only the large outer plan-
ets with the most angular momentum. The central Sun
(mass 
radius 
) spins about its
axis once every 25 days and the planets Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune move in nearly circular orbits
around the Sun with orbital data given in the Table below.
Ignore each planet’s spin about its own axis.

and exits from the waterwheel at a speed
(a) If 85 kg of water passes through per
second, what is the rate at which the water delivers angu-
lar momentum to the waterwheel? (b) What is the torque
the water applies to the
waterwheel? (c) If the water
causes the w
