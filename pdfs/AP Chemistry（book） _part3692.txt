3. The names of anionic ligands end in the letter o, but electrically neu-
tral ligands ordinarily bear the name of the molecules (Table 23.5). Special 
names are used for H2O (aqua), NH3 (ammine), and CO (carbonyl). For example, 
3Fe(CN)2(NH3)2(H2O)24+ is the diamminediaquadicyanoiron(III) ion.
for forming the iron complex are about the same for transferrin and 
siderophores. The more iron available to the bacterium, the more rap-
idly it can reproduce and thus the more harm it can do.
Several years ago, New Zealand clinics regularly gave iron supple-
ments to infants soon after birth. However, the incidence of certain 
bacterial infections was eight times higher in treated than in untreat-
ed infants. Presumably, the presence of more iron in the blood than 
absolutely necessary makes it easier for bacteria to obtain the iron 
needed for growth and reproduction.
In the United States, it is common medical pract
