†AC circuits that contain only a voltage source and resistors can be analyzed like the dc circuits in this
Chapter. However, ac circuits that contain capacitors and other circuit elements are more compli-
cated, and we discuss them in Chapter 21.
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
The automobile headlight bulbs 
shown in the circuits here are 
identical. The battery connection 
which produces more light is
(a) circuit 1.
(b) circuit 2.
(c) both the same.
(d) not enough information.
This cell phone has an attachment that measures a person’s blood sugar level, and plots it over a period
of days. All electronic devices contain circuits that are dc, at least in part. The circuit diagram below
shows a possible amplifier circuit for an audio output (cell
phone ear piece). We have already met two of the circuit
elements shown: resistors and capacitors, and we discuss them
