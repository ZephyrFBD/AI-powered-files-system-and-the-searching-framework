hat ways is de Broglie’s hypothesis, as it applies to 
electrons, consistent with J. J. Thomson’s conclusion that 
the electron has mass? In what sense is it consistent with 
proposals preceding Thomson’s work that the cathode rays 
are a wave phenomenon?
 6.110  The two most common isotopes of uranium are 235U and 
238U. (a) Compare the number of protons, the number of 
electrons, and the number of neutrons in atoms of these 
two isotopes. (b) Using the periodic table in the front- 
inside cover, write the electron conﬁguration for a U atom. 
(c) Compare your answer to part (b) to the electron con-
ﬁguration given in Figure 6.30. How can you explain any 
differences between these two electron conﬁgurations? 
 
(d) 238U undergoes radioactive decay to 234Th. How many 
protons, electrons, and neutrons are gained or lost by the 
238U atom during this process? (e) Examine the electron 
conﬁguration for Th in Figure 6.31. Are you surprised by 
what you ﬁnd? Explain.
