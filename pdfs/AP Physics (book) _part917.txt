 negative x or y axis, it must have a negative sign. Equations 9–1
represent the first condition for equilibrium.
We saw in Chapter 4 that to solve Problems involving forces, we need to draw
a free-body diagram, indicating all the forces on a given object (see Section  4–7).

on it is zero, the ruler will move
(rotate). A pair of equal forces acting
in opposite directions but at different
points on an object (as shown here) is
referred to as a couple.

FIGURE 9–4 Example 9–2.
Chandelier cord tension. Calculate the tensions 
and 
in the two cords that are connected to the vertical cord supporting the 200-kg
chandelier in Fig. 9–4. Ignore the mass of the cords.
APPROACH We need a free-body diagram, but for which object? If we choose
the chandelier, the cord supporting it must exert a force equal to the chande-
lier’s weight
