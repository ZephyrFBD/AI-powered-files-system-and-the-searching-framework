es is called the smooth ER (SER). The smooth ER
makes lipids, hormones, and steroids and breaks down toxic chemicals.
Golgi Complex
The Golgi complex, which look like stacks of flattened sacs, also participate in the processing of proteins. Once the
ribosomes on the rough ER have completed synthesizing proteins, the Golgi complex modify, process, and sort the
products. Theyâ€™re the packaging and distribution centers for materials destined to be sent out of the cell. They
package the final products in little sacs called vesicles, which carry products to the plasma membrane. Golgi
complex are also involved in the production of lysosomes.
The flattened membrane disks of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
apparatus are called cisternae. A Golgi stack may contain anywhere from 3 to
20 cisternae, and these are divided into cis (close to the RER), medial (in the
middle), and trans (farthest from the RER). Each cisternae type contains
different types of enzymes, and molecules can move between
