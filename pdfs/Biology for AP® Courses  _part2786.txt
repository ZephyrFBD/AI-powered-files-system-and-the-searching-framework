110. The net photosynthetic production rate (NPP) is the
difference between the rate of carbon fixation by
photosynthesis (P) and the respiration rate (R). Each of
these rates can be expressed in units of grams of carbon
per day (gC/d). Vascular plants convert fixed carbon that is
not released as carbon dioxide into biomass with a growth
rate (G).
A. Draw areas within the box to represent the rates of
growth (G) and respiration (R) to show the limit of each
on the overall growth rate. The area of the box represents
the rate of photosynthesis (P).
Figure 23.42
When the dependences on temperature of photosynthetic
and respiration rates of a vascular plant are measured, the
results depend on the species but have the general form
shown in the figure. In these measurements, the
temperature is maintained for several hours. The plant is
then returned to 25 Â°C for several hours before the next set
of measurements is
