termed weak-field ligands; those at the high@∆ end are termed strong-field ligands.

CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
Let’s take a closer look at the colors and crystal-field splitting as we vary the ligands 
for the series of Ni2+ complexes discussed above. Because the Ni atom has an 3Ar43d84s2 
electron configuration, Ni2+ has the configuration 3Ar43d8 and therefore is a d8 ion. The 
t2 set of orbitals holds six electrons, two in each orbital, while the last two electrons go 
into the e set of orbitals. Consistent with Hund’s rule, each e orbital holds one electron 
and both electrons have the same spin. 
 (Section 6.8)
As the ligand changes from H2O to NH3 to ethylenediamine, the spectrochemi-
cal series tells us that the crystal-field, ∆, exerted by the six li
