vity, rather than the absence or presence
of activity, to encode visual signals for the brain. Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other
photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more
distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating lateral inhibition. This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast
in the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker. Amacrine cells can
distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells.
You can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to “trick” your retina and brain about the colors you are observing in
your visual field. Look fixedly at Figure 27.22 for about 45 seconds. Then quickly shift your gaze to a sheet of blank white
paper or a white wall. You should see an afterimage of the Norwegian flag in its correct colors. At this point, close your
eyes for a moment, the
