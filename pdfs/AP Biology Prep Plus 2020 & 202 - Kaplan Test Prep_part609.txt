h the environment seems to be the
sole determinant of handedness. Because (A) oﬀers the least likely
outcome, it is correct. (B) is incorrect because this result is consistent
with sinistral being the dominant trait. (C) is incorrect because this
result is consistent with dextral being the dominant trait. (D) is
incorrect because this result is consistent with a more complex non-
Mendelian inheritance pattern, with environmental factors having
limited influence.

According to the question stem, the gene is oﬀ by default but can be
expressed when an activator binds and turns it on. This is positive
control, as indicated in (B). (A) is incorrect because the gene is not
expressed throughout development, but is oﬀ by default (constitutive
expression means that a gene is continually expressed). (C) is incorrect
because the default for the gene is oﬀ and it is turned on by an
activator; in negative control, a gene is on by default and is turned oﬀ
with a represso
