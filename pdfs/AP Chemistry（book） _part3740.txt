illustrated in Figure 23.34. Note in particular that the dz2 orbital is considerably lower in 
energy than the dx2 - y2 orbital. To understand why this is so, recall from Figure 23.28 that 
in an octahedral field the dz2 orbital of the metal ion interacts with the ligands positioned 
above and below the xy plane. There are no ligands in these two positions in a square- 
planar complex, which means that the dz2 orbital experiences less repulsion and so 
remains in a lower-energy, more stable state.
Square-planar complexes are characteristic of metal ions with a d8 electron config-
uration. They are nearly always low spin, with the eight d electrons spin-paired to form 
a diamagnetic complex. This pairing leaves the dx2 - y2 orbital empty. Such an electronic 
arrangement is particularly common among the d8 ions of periods 5 a
