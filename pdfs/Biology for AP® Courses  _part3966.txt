molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage. Patients who
develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA. These antibodies
may have been initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens. This
phenomenon is also called molecular mimicry.
Antibodies of the Mucosal Immune System
Antibodies synthesized by the mucosal immune system include IgA and IgM. Activated B cells differentiate into mucosal

plasma cells that synthesize and secrete dimeric IgA, and to a lesser extent, pentameric IgM. Secreted IgA is abundant in
tears, saliva, breast milk, and in secretions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Antibody secretion results in a local
humoral response at epithelial surfaces and prevents infection of the mucosa by bindi
