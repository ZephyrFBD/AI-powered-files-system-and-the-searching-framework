roduction 
of formaldehyde (CH2O) in exhaust gases. Formaldehyde 
undergoes photodissociation, which contributes to photo-
chemical smog:
CH2O + hn ¡ CHO + H
The maximum wavelength of light that can cause this reac-
tion is 335 nm. (a) In what part of the electromagnetic spec-
trum is light with this wavelength found? (b) What is the 
maximum strength of a bond, in kJ>mol, that can be bro-
ken by absorption of a photon of 335-nm light? (c) Com-
pare your answer from part (b) to the appropriate value from 
Table 8.3. What do you conclude about C ¬H bond energy 
in formaldehyde? (d) Write out the formaldehyde photodis-
sociation reaction, showing Lewis-dot structures.
 18.34  An important reaction in the formation of photochemical 
smog is the photodissociation of NO2:
NO2 + hn ¡ NO1g2 + O1g2
The maximum wavelength of light that can cause this reac-
tion is 420 nm. (a) In what part of the electromagnetic spec-
trum is light with this wavelength found? (b) What is the 
maximum strength of
