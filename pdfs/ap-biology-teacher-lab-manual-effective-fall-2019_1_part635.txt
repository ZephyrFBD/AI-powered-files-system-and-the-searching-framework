Teachers can purchase a variety of packaged systems for growing plants and rearing 
butterflies, or they can construct their own. See the Wisconsin Fast Plants website for 
suggested plant-growing chambers and butterfly-rearing systems. Suggested growing 
systems are made from recycled one-liter plastic drink bottles. Recycled plastic deli 
containers work well for making the Brassica Barn or butterfly nurser
