you should 
become comfortable converting pressures from one unit to another.
Give It Some Thought
Convert a pressure of 745 torr to a pressure in (a) mm Hg, (b) atm, (c) kPa, (d) bar.
What happens to h, the height of the mercury column, if the 
atmospheric pressure increases?

(a) Assume that the top of your head has a surface area of 25 cm * 25 cm. How 
many newtons of force push on your head at sea level? (b) If you estimate this area 
to be 100 in.2, what is the force in pounds?
Give It Some Thought
calculated, 100 kPa, can be reported as 1 bar. (The actual atmospheric pressure at any 
location depends on weather conditions and altitude.) Another pressure unit is pounds 
per square inch 1psi, lbs>in.22. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi.
