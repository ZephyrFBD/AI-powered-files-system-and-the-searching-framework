mating, but it also supplies the pregnant
mother with nourishment for fetal development and, following birth, the development of the young progeny.
Migration, as described above, is the long distance, seasonal movement of animals in response to seasonal changes
in the availability of food.
Communication in Animals
Communication in animals is commonly used in species recognition, in mating behavior, and in organizing social
behavior. Communication occurs through the following mechanisms:
1. Chemical. Chemicals used for communication are called pheromones. Chemicals that cause immediate and
specific behavioral changes are releaser pheromones (they “release,” or trigger, the behavior); those that cause
developmental or other physiological changes are called primer pheromones. Some chemicals elicit responses
when they are smelled; others trigger responses when they are eaten.
Reproductively receptive female moths attract male moths by emitting releaser pheromones into the air.
