We can use standard reduction potentials to understand the activity series of met-
als. 
 (Section 4.4) Recall that any metal in the activity series (Table 4.5) is oxidized 
by the ions of any metal below it. We can now recognize the origin of this rule based 
on standard reduction potentials. The activity series is based on the oxidation reac-
tions of the metals, ordered from strongest reducing agent at the top to weakest reduc-
ing agent at the bottom. (Thus, the ordering is inverted relative to that in Table 20.1.) 
For example, nickel lies above silver in the activity series, making nickel the stronger 
reducing agent. Because a reducing agent is oxidized in any redox reaction, nickel is 
more easily oxidized than silver. In a mixture of nickel metal and silver cations, there-
fore, we expect a displacement reaction in which the silver ions are displaced in the 
solution by nickel io
