Centered rectangular lattice
▲ Figure 12.4 The five two-dimensional lattices. The primitive unit cell for each lattice is shaded in  
blue. For the rhombic lattice the centered rectangular unit cell is shaded in green. Unlike the primitive  
rhombic unit cell, the centered cell has two lattice points per unit cell.
Go Figure
Why is there a centered rectangular 
lattice but not a centered square 
lattice?
▲ Figure 12.5 Not all shapes tile space. 
Tiling means covering a surface entirely, 
which is impossible for some geometric 
shapes, as shown here for pentagons.
Cubic
