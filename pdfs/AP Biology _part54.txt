ion of misfolded proteins,
called prions, in brain cells.
Three complementary techniques are used to reveal the three-
dimensional shape or conformation of proteins. These are X-ray
crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and a
new 
field, 
bioinformatics. 
Bioinformatics 
uses 
computers 
and
mathematical modeling to integrate the huge volume of data generated
from the analysis of an amino acid sequence of a protein to predict the
three-dimensional structure of the resulting protein molecule. Currently,
the three-dimensional shape of more than 20,000 proteins has been

determined.
Nucleic Acids
The two nucleic acids are ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA). They encode all hereditary information. Through RNA
intermediates, the information encoded in the sequence of nucleotides in
DNA specifies the amino acid sequences of all proteins. Nucleic acids are
polymers, polynucleotides that consist of repeat
