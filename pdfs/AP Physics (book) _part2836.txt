t microscope also makes use of interference and differences
in phase to produce a high-contrast image. Contrast is achieved by a circular
glass phase plate that has a groove (or a raised portion) in the shape of a ring,
positioned so undeviated source rays pass through it, but rays deviated by the
object do not pass through this ring. Because the rays deviated by the object travel
through a different thickness of glass than the undeviated source rays, the two can
be out of phase and can interfere destructively at the object image plane. Thus the
image of the object can contrast sharply with the background. Phase-contrast
microscope images tend to have “halos”around them (as a result of diffraction from
the phase-plate opening), so care must be taken in the interpretation of images.
