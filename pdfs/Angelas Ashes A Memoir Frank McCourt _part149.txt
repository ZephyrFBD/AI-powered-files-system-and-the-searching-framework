 dren dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of 
 
 losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers 
 
 shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. 
 
 Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance. 
 
 Dad says he’s glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and 
 
 they tell him they don’t need the likes of him with his northern accent 
 
 to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself 
 
 dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a 
 
 knacker. 
 
 A few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, 
 
 We’ll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet 
 
 Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he’s very sorry for his troubles and 
 
 would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here? 
 
 There are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff 
 
 before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too.
