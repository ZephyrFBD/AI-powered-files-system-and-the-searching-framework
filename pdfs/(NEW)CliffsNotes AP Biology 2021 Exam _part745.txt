ed values can be explained by chance. Thus,
for the fruit fly
 
calculations, the calculated value of χ2 = 1.0, at df = 1 and p = 0.05, is
less than the critical value. What do you do with this value?
Reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is that the observed values are not significantly different from the
expected values; that is, the differences are the result of chance. If the calculated value for χ2 is more than the
critical value, you reject the null hypothesis.
Accept the null hypothesis. If the calculated value for χ2 is less
than the critical value, you do not reject the null hypothesis. “Do not reject the null hypothesis” is not quite the same
as saying you accept the null hypothesis because accepting the null hypothesis implies that you proved it to be true.
However, proof doesn’t happen in statistics (or science). Instead, you were not able to disprove it.
If your calculated value for χ2 is greater than the critical value, and you
rejected the null hypothesis, then
