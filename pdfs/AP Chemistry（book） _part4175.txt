CCl4 6 CBr4; 
hence, the dispersion forces and boiling points increase in the same 
order. page 444 Mainly hydrogen bonds, which hold the indi-
vidual H2O molecules together in the liquid. page 444 Ca1NO322 
in water, because calcium nitrate is a strong electrolyte that forms 
ions and water is a polar molecule with a dipole moment. Ionâ€“dipole 
forces cannot be present in a CH3OH>H2O mixture because CH3OH 
does not form ions. page 448 Decrease. page 450 Melting (or 
fusion), endothermic page 452 The intermolecular attractive 
forces in H2O are much stronger than those in H2S because H2O can 
form hydrogen bonds. The stronger intermolecular forces results in 
a higher critical temperature and pressure. page 454 CCl4. Both 
compounds are nonpolar; therefore, only dispersion forces exist 
between the molecules. Because dispersion forces are stronger for 
the larger, heavier CBr4, it has a lower vapor pressure than CCl4. The 
substance with the larger vapor pressure at a given temperature
