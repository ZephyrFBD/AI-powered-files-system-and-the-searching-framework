q2 = 9%        Converting to a decimal: q2 = 0.09
To solve for q, find the square root of 0.09, which is 0.3.
Since p + q = 1, if q = 0.3, then p = 0.7.
The hybrid brown condition is represented by 2pq.
To solve for the percent of the population that is hybrid, substitute
values for 2(p)(q).
The percentage of the population that is hybrid brown is 2(.7)(.3) =
42%.
Homozygous dominant is represented by p2.
The percentage of the population that is homozygous brown is p2 =
(.7)2 = 49%.
BE CAREFUL
The square root of 0.09 is 0.3, not 0.03.
PROBLEM 2
Determine the percent of the population that is homozygous dominant if the percent of
the population that is homozygous recessive is 16%.
Homozygous recessive = q2 = 16. Therefore, q2 = .16 and q = 0.4.
If q = 0.4, then p = 0.6.
Therefore, the percentage of the population that is homozygous
dominant = p2 = (.6)2 = .36 = 36%.
