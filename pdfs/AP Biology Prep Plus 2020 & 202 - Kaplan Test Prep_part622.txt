perly.
(B)
Because the repressor would be aﬀected by the mutation, the
repressor would bind too strongly to the operator and the
genes could not be expressed at all.
(C)
Because the repressor could not recognize the operator, the
repressor would not bind and the genes would be expressed.

3. Purebred Birman cats have distinctive white feet (called “gloves”)
that develop from having two copies of a Mendelian gloving allele.
What could most reasonably be concluded if two cats that did not
have gloves were crossed and produced a kitten with gloving?
The gloving allele is dominant and a mutation must have
occurred for the kitten to have gloving.
(A)
The gloving allele is dominant and it was passed by one
parent to the kitten.
(B)
The gloving allele is recessive and both of the parents must
have been carriers.
(C)
The gloving allele is recessive and a single parent must have
passed it to the kitten.

whose mutation is ass
