endent assortment). However, if certain combinations of alleles are found more often in offspring than
they should (based on Mendelian ratios), this is a red flag that the two genes are close together and linked.
Look at the example below from a cross of TtGg and ttgg. If you draw out the Punnett square, you should get equal
numbers of each phenotype occurring if the genes are assumed to be unlinked. Yet, what if the numbers below were
the actual numbers of offspring of each phenotype?
Tall and Green: 6 offspring
short and Green: 37 offspring
Tall and yellow: 45 offspring
short and yellow: 3 offspring
There are more Green/short and yellow/Tall offspring. This is a sign that these alleles are linked on a chromosome
because they occur more often than they statistically should. This shows that most of the gametes of the TtGg parent
had tG together and Tg together since those gamete combinations would result in Green/short and yellow/Tall
offspring.
So, where did the Green/Tall and yellow/
