Chemical breakdown. Proteins are chemically broken down (digested) by the enzyme pepsin. Stomach cells
producing pepsin are protected from self-digestion because they produce and secrete an inactive form, pepsinogen.
Pepsinogen is activated into pepsin by HCl, which is produced by other stomach cells. Thus, only after pepsinogen
is secreted into the stomach cavity can protein digestion begin. Once protein digestion begins, the stomach is
protected by a layer of mucus secreted by still other cells in the stomach lining. Failure of the mucus to protect the
stomach can lead to lesions, or peptic ulcers. Long believed to be caused by stress, diet, or other factors, most ulcers
are now known to be caused by bacteria and can be successfully treated with antibiotics.
Controlled release. Movement of chyme into the small intestine is regulated by a valve at the end of the stomach,
the pyloric sphincter.
