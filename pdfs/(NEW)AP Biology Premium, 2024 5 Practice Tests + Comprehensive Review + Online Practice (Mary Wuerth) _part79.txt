acid with a pH of 2 has the greatest concentration of H+. All the other
answer choices have a higher pH value than that of choice (A) and therefore a lower [H+].
5. (C) pH is a logarithmic scale, so a difference of three pH units would result in a difference of 103 times the [H+]
concentration. Choice (A) is incorrect because pH is not a linear scale. Choice (B) is incorrect because 103 is
not 30 times. Choice (D) is incorrect because 103 is not 3,000 times.
6. (B) Waterâ€™s ability to form hydrogen bonds allows it to absorb and release large amounts of heat, giving water a
higher specific heat than that of many other liquids. Locations near large bodies of water have more stable
climates because the nearby bodies of water can absorb atmospheric heat during the day and then release it at
night, leading to more stable climates. Choice (A) is incorrect because surface tension only affects the surface of
the body of water and does not affect climate. Choice (C) is incorrect because capillar
