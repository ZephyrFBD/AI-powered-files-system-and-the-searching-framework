 dipole moment. The instantaneous distribution of 
the electrons, however, can be different from the average distribution. If we could freeze 
the motion of the electrons at any given instant, both electrons could be on one side 
of the nucleus. At just that instant, the atom has an instantaneous dipole moment as 
shown in Figure 11.4(b). The motions of electrons in one atom influence the motions of 
electrons in its neighbors. The instantaneous dipole on one atom can induce an instan-
taneous dipole on an adjacent atom, causing the atoms to be attracted to each other as 
shown in Figure 11.4(c). This attractive interaction is called the dispersion force (also 
called London dispersion forces or induced dipoleâ€“induced dipole interactions). It is significant 
only when molecules are very close together.
The strength of the dispersion force depends on the ease with which the charge distribu-
tion in a molecule can be distorted to induce an instantaneous dipole. The ease with which
