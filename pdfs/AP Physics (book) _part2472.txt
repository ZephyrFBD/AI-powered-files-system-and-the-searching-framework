a radio transmitter.
The next decade saw the development of vacuum tubes. Out of this early
work radio and television were born. We now discuss briefly (1) how radio and
TV signals are transmitted, and (2) how they are received at home.
The process by which a radio station transmits information (words and music)
is outlined in Fig. 22–13. The audio (sound) information is changed into an elec-
trical signal of the same frequencies by, say, a microphone, a laser, or a magnetic
read write head. This electrical signal is called an audiofrequency (AF) signal,
because the frequencies are in the audio range (20 to 20,000 Hz). The signal is ampli-
fied electron
