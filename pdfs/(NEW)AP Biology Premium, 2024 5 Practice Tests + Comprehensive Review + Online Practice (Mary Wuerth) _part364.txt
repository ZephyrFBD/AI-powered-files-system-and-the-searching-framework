CAU GCA – 3′. The template strand of DNA is also known as the “minus strand” or the “noncoding strand” or the
“antisense strand.” This is because the sequence of the mRNA strand that will be read by the ribosome during
translation is actually not identical to the sequence of the DNA strand from which it was transcribed but instead is
the complement (or opposite) of the DNA strand from which it was transcribed. The strand of the double helix that
functions as the template strand can vary depending on the gene being transcribed.
TIP
Remember that RNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for transcription and forms RNA molecules while DNA polymerase is the enzyme
responsible for DNA replication and forms DNA molecules. Be sure not to confuse these two enzymes on the AP exam.
Remember that one of the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is that prokaryotic cells do not
have a nucleus. Therefore, in most prokaryotic cells, the mRNA transcript formed in transcription is imme
