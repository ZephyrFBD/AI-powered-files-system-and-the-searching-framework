with a solubility less than 0.01 mol>L will be considered insoluble. In these cases, the 
attraction between the oppositely charged ions in the solid is too great for the water 
molecules to separate the ions to any significant extent; the substance remains largely 
undissolved.
Unfortunately, there are no rules based on simple physical properties such as ionic 
charge to guide us in predicting whether a particular ionic compound will be soluble. 
Experimental observations, however, have led to guidelines for predicting solubility for 
ionic compounds. For example, experiments show that all common ionic compounds 
that contain the nitrate anion, NO3
-, are soluble in water. Table 4.1 summarizes the solu-
bility guidelines for common ionic compounds. Th
