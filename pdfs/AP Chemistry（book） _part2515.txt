 not occur in aqueous solution. In the reaction 
between gas phase HCl and NH3, for example, a proton is transferred from the acid HCl 
to the base NH3:

The hazy film that forms on the windows of general chemistry laboratories and on glass-
ware in the laboratory (Figure 16.3) is largely solid NH4Cl formed by the gas-phase reac-
tion between HCl and NH3.
Let’s consider another example that compares the relationship between the Arrhe-
nius and Brønsted–Lowry definitions of acids and bases—an aqueous solution of ammo-
nia, in which we have the equilibrium:
 
NH31aq2 + H2O1l2 ∆ NH4
+
  1aq2 + OH -1aq2 
[16.5]
Ammonia is a Brønsted–Lowry base because it accepts a proton from H2O. Ammonia is 
also an Arrhenius base because adding it to water leads to an increase in the concentra-
tion of OH -1aq2.
The transfer of a proton always involves both an acid (donor) and a base (acceptor).
In other words, a substance can function as an acid only if another substance simulta-
neously behav
