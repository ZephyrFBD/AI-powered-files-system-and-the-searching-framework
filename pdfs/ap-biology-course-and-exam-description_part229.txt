ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-1
The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.M
Describe the strategies 
organisms use to acquire and 
use energy.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.M.1
Organisms use energy to maintain 
organization, grow, and reproduce—
a. Organisms use different strategies to 
regulate body temperature and metabolism.
 i.	 Endotherms use thermal energy 
generated by metabolism to maintain 
homeostatic body temperatures.
ii.	 Ectotherms lack efficient internal 
mechanisms for maintaining body 
temperature, though they may regulate 
their temperature behaviorally by moving 
into the sun or shade or by aggregating 
with other individuals.
b.	
c.	There is a relationship between metabolic 
rate per unit body mass and the size of 
multicellular organisms—generally, the 
smaller the organism, the hi
