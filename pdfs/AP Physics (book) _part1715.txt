nuclear forces so they are now considered to have a common origin
known as the electroweak force. We discuss the other forces in later Chapters.
CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
Two identical tiny spheres have the same electric charge. If their separation is
doubled, the force each exerts on the other will be
(a) half.
(b) double.
(c) four times larger.
(d) one-quarter as large.
(e) unchanged.
T
he word “electricity” may evoke an image of complex modern technology:
lights, motors, electronics, and computers. But the electric force plays an
even deeper role in our lives. According to atomic theory, electric forces
between atoms and molecules hold them together to form liquids and solids, and
electric forces are also involved in the metabolic processes that occur within our
bodies. Many of the forces we have dealt with so far, such as elastic forces, the
normal force, and friction and other contact forces (pushes and pulls), are now
considered to result from electric forces acting at
