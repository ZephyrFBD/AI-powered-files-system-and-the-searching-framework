es are under intense development. Currently, 
the anode material is graphite, a form of carbon, and the cath-
ode is a transition metal oxide, often lithium cobalt oxide, LiCoO2 
(Figure 7.9). Between anode and cathode is a separator, a porous solid 
material that allows the passage of lithium ions but not electrons.
When the battery is being charged by an external source, lithium 
ions migrate through the separator from the cathode to the anode 
where they insert between the layers of carbon atoms. The ability of 
an ion to move through a solid increases 
as the size of the ion decreases and as the 
charge on the ion decreases. Lithium ions 
are smaller than most other cations, and 
they carry only a 1+ charge, which allows 
them to migrate more readily than other 
ions can. As an added bonus, lithium is 
one of the lightest elements, which is at-
tractive for use in electric vehicles. When 
the battery discharges, the lithium ions 
move from anode to cathode. To maintain
