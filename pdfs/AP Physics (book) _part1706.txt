 requires 25 hp, what is the efficiency of the
engine under those conditions?

and has an
efficiency of 25%. By how many kelvins should the high
operating temperature 
be increased to achieve an effi-
ciency of 35%?

69. A 38% efficient power plant puts out 850 MW of electrical
power. Cooling towers take away the exhaust heat. (a) If the
air temperature is allowed to rise 7.0 C°, estimate what volume
of air 
is heated per day. Will the local climate be
heated significantly? (b) If the heated air were to form a layer
180 m thick, estimate how large an area it would cover for
24 h of operation. Assume the air has density 
and
has specific heat of about 
at constant pre
