▲ Figure 17.10 Procedure for calculating pH when a weak acid is partially neutralized by a strong base.
Calculate the pH of the solution formed when 45.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH is added to 50.0 mL of 0.100 M CH3COOH
1Ka = 1.8 * 10-52.

Stoichiometry Calculation: The product of the 
volume and concentration of each solution 
gives the number of moles of each reactant 
present before the neutralization:
Analyze We are asked to calculate the pH before the equivalence 
point of the titration of a weak acid with a strong base.
Plan We first must determine the number of moles of 
CH3COOH and CH3COO- present after the neutralization
