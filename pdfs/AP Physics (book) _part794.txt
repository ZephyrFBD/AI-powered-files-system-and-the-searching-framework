des. If not, try the slower 
merry-go-round or Ferris 
wheel. Rotating carnival rides 
have rotational kinetic energy 
as well as angular momentum.
Angular acceleration is 
produced by a net torque, and 
rotating objects have rotational 
kinetic energy.

The motion of a rigid object can be analyzed as the translational motion of the
object’s center of mass, plus rotational motion about its center of mass (Section 7–8).
We have already discussed translational motion in detail, so now we focus on
purely rotational motion. By purely rotational motion we mean that all points in
the object move in circles, such as the point P in the rotating wh
