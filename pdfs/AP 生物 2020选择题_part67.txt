 each color group were 
fitted with a harmless mouthpiece that stopped the beaks from entirely closing. The mouthpiece prevented 
pigeons from removing lice but did not affect the pigeonsâ€™ ability to feed. Each pigeon was isolated and kept in 
identical environmental conditions for temperature, humidity, and amount of light. The lice have a generation 
time of 24 days. The researchers observed the phenotypes of the lice over a period of four years. 
(a) Describe the importance of phenotypic variation in louse body color among individuals in a population of lice. 
(b) Justify the decision of the researchers to hold lighting conditions constant in their experiment. 
(c) Predict the most likely effect of the pigeons cleaning their feathers on the phenotypes of the lice after four 
years. 
(d) Provide reasoning to support your prediction in part (c).
