oviding nutrients and protection from the exterior environment. This
theory of the origin of mitochondria and the modern eukaryotic cell is
called the endosymbiotic hypothesis.
SPECIALIZED PLANT ORGANELLES
Plants also have some organelles that are not found in animal cells.
Chloroplasts are found only in plant cells and some protists. With the
help of one of their primary components, chlorophyll, chloroplasts
function as the site of photosynthesis, using the energy of the Sun to
produce glucose. Chloroplasts have two membranes, an inner and an
outer membrane. Additional membrane sacs called thylakoids inside the
chloroplast are derived from the inner membrane and form stacks called
grana. The fluid inside the chloroplast surrounding the grana is the
stroma. The thylakoid membranes contain the chlorophyll of the cell.
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts contain their own DNA and ribosomes
and exhibit the same semi-autonomy. They are also believed to have
evolved via symbiosis of an early ph
