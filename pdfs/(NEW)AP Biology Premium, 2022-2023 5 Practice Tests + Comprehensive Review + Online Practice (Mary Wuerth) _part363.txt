eukaryotic promoters contain a region called a TATA box, so named because it is rich in thymine
and adenine nucleotides. Proteins called transcription factors help RNA polymerase bind to the promoter sequence
and begin transcription.
During transcription, RNA polymerase adds new RNA nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction, similar to how DNA
polymerase adds new DNA nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction during DNA replication. The strand of DNA being
transcribed by RNA polymerase is called the template strand. The newly synthesized RNA must be antiparallel to
the template DNA strand, so RNA polymerase reads the template DNA strand in the 3′ to 5′ direction. The sequence
of base pairs in the RNA strand that is transcribed is complementary to the template DNA sequence. For example, if
the DNA sequence is 3′ – ACG TAC GTA CGT – 5′, the newly synthesized RNA sequence will be 5′ – UGC AUG
CAU GCA – 3′. The template strand of DNA is also known as the “minus strand” or the “noncoding strand” or
