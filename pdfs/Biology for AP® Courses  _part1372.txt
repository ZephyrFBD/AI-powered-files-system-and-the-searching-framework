 fruit regardless of the Y alleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy × WwYy) would
produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green.
Finally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the
same phenotype. In the shepherd’s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by
two genes in a dominant epistatic relationship. When the genes A and B are both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds
are ovoid. If the dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds. That is, every possible
genotype other than aabb results in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaBb x AaBb)
would yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid.
As you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that
totals 16 is ty
