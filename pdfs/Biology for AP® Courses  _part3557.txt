by an individual’s will, such as muscles in the
digestive system.

37. Biomimetics is the design of engineering solutions
guided by biological solutions to similar problems.
Support materials in biological systems must be tough,
flexible, and light. Engineers define a tough material as
one that can absorb energy without fracturing. Flexibility
is the ability to deform elastically but able to return to the
original shape. Size of in both biological and designed
system is often determined by many factors. Density of a
material becomes important when size cannot be adjusted
but lightness is needed. An analysis of several biological
materials in terms of these parameters (Wegst and Ashby,
