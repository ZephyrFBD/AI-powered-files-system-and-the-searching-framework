e. This is the principle of superposition.
Electric fields are represented by electric field lines that
start on positive charges and end on negative charges. Their
direction indicates the direction the force would be on a tiny
positive test charge placed at each point. The lines can be drawn
so that the number per unit area is proportional to the magni-
tude of E.
The static electric field inside a conductor is zero, and the
electric field lines just outside a charged conductor are perpen-
dicular to its surface.
[*In the replication of DNA, the electrostatic force plays 
a crucial role in selecting the proper molecules so that the
genetic information is passed on accurately from generation to
generation.]
[*Photocopiers and computer printers use electric charge
placed on toner particles and a drum to form an image.]

uniform electric field
