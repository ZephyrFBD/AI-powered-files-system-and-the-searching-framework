nds. These tortoises were “selected” because they could reach
more leaves and access more food than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available,
those that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn’t reach the food source.
Consequently, long-necked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to
their offspring. Over time, only long-necked tortoises would be present in the population.
Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most
characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and
Wallace, knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than
are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms
