 of two slightly soluble salts of M2 +, MA 
and MZ2, is the same, 4 * 10-4 mol/L. (a) Which has the 
larger numerical value for the solubility product constant? 
(b) In a saturated solution of each salt in water, which has 
the higher concentration of M2 +? (c) If you added an equal 
volume of a solution saturated in MA to one saturated in 
MZ2, what would be the equilibrium concentration of the 
cation, M2 +?
