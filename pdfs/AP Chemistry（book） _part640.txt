 4.11 Which data set, of the two graphed here, would you expect 
to observe from a titration like that shown in Figure 4.18?

(Section 4.1)
 4.13 State whether each of the following statements is true or 
false. Justify your answer in each case.
 
 (a)  
Electrolyte solutions conduct electricity because elec-
trons are moving through the solution.
 
 (b)  
If you add a nonelectrolyte to an aqueous solution that 
already contains an electrolyte, the electrical conduc-
tivity will not change.
 4.14 State whether each of the following statements is true or 
false. Justify your answer in each case.
 
 (a)  
When methanol, CH3OH, is dissolved in water, a con-
ducting solution results.
 
 (b)  
When acetic acid, CH3COOH, dissolves in water, the 
solution is weakly conducting and acidic in nature.
 4.15 We have learned in this chapter that many ionic solids dis-
solve in water as strong el
