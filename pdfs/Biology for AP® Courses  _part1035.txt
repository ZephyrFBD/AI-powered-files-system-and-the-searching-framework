 This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another
complicating element is signal integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface
receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are
met before a cell commits to a specific response.
The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single
ligand binds to a single receptor. However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component
of the signaling cascade, which amplifies the signal.
Methods of Intracellular Signaling
The induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme. There are
numerous enzymatic modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next component downstream. The
following are some of the more common
