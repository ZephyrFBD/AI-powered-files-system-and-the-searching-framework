can be attached as shown in Fig. 19–15. Assume the starter
motor can be represented as a resistor 
Determine the current
through the starter motor (a) if only the weak battery is connected to it, and (b) if
the good battery is also connected, as shown in Fig. 19–15.
APPROACH We apply Kirchhoff’s rules, but in (b) we will first need to deter-
mine the resistance of the jumper cables using their dimensions and the resistivity
as discussed in Section 18–4.
SOLUTION (a) The circuit with only the weak battery and no jumper cables is
simple: an emf of 10.1 V connected to two resistances in series,
Hence the current is
(b) We need to find the resistance of the jumper cables that connect the 
good battery to the weak one. From Eq. 18–3, each has resistance 
Kirchhoff’s loop rule for the full outside loop gives
