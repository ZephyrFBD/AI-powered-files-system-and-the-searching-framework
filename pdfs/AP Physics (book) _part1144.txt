at the original starting point,

EXERCISE A A mass is oscillating on a frictionless surface at the end of a horizontal
spring. Where, if anywhere, is the acceleration of the mass zero (see Fig. 11–2)?

To discuss oscillatory motion, we need to define a few terms. The distance x
of the mass from the equilibrium point at any moment is the displacement
The maximum displacement—the greatest distance from
the equilibrium point—is called the amplitude, A. One cycle refers to the com-
plete to-and-fro motion from some initial point back to that same point—say,
from
to
and back to
The period, T, is defined as
the time required to complete one cycle. Finally, the frequency, f, is the number
of complete cycles per second. Frequency is ge
