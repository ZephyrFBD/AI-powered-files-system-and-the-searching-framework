n has a positive charge (
the same magnitude
as for the electron) and its mass is measured to be
The neutron, whose existence was ascertained in 1932 by the English physicist
James Chadwick (1891â€“1974), is electrically neutral 
as its name implies.
Its mass is very slightly larger than that of the proton:
These two constituents of a nucleus, neutrons and protons, are referred to collec-
tively as nucleons.
Although a normal hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton alone, the
nuclei of all other elements consist of both neutrons and protons. The different
nuclei are often referred to as nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus (or
nuclide) is called the atomic number and is designated by the symbol Z. The total
number of nucleons, neutrons plus protons, is designated by the symbol A and is
called the atomic mass number, or sometimes simply mass number. This name is
used since the mass of a nucleus is very closely A times the mass of one nucleon.
