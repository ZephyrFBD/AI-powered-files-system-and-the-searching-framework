When we square the wave function of the s

*  MO, we get 
the electron density representation which we saw earlier, in 
Figure 9.32. Notice once again that we lose the phase informa-
tion when we look at the electron density.
The wave functions of atomic and molecular orbitals are used 
by chemists to understand many aspects of chemical bonding, 
spectroscopy, and reactivity. If you take a course in organic chem-
istry, you will probably see orbitals drawn to show the phases as in 
this box.
