Check The high frequency is reasonable because of the short wave-
length. The units are proper because frequency has units of “per 
second,” or s - 1.
▲ Figure 6.5 Color and temperature. The 
color and intensity of the light emitted by 
a hot object, such as this nail, depend on 
the temperature of the object.

Which is at a higher temperature: the 
part of the nail glowing yellow or the 
part glowing red?

Give It Some Thought
Consider the notes that can be played on a piano. In what way is a piano an 
example of a quantized system? In this analogy, would a violin be continuous  
or quantized?
According to Planck’s theory, matter can emit and absorb energy only in whole num-
ber multiples of hn, such as hn, 2hn, 3hn, and so forth. If the quantity of energy emitted by 
an atom is 3hn, for example, we say that three quanta of energy have been emi
