fer of a parent cell’s complete genome to each of the
two resulting daughter cells. Mitosis consists of four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
In prophase, the nuclear membrane dissolves and the chromosomes condense and become visible. Spindle
fibers also begin to form.
In metaphase, the spindle fibers have fully attached to the centromeres of each chromosome. Chromosomes
are then aligned along the “equator” of the cell in a single column. The center of the mitotic spindle is called
the metaphase plate.
During anaphase, each chromosome splits at its centromere as opposing spindle fibers begin to shorten. The
identical chromatids are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell. At this point, each chromatid now has its own
centromere and is considered a separate chromosome. At the end of anaphase, the cell has twice the number of
chromosomes that it had at the start of the cell cycle.
In telophase, two new nuclear membranes form. Each of the two nuclei now contain the sa
