with the medium ground finch on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major. The birds have inherited variation in the
bill shape with some birds having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills. During a period in which rainfall was
higher than normal because of an El Niño, the large hard seeds that large-billed birds ate were reduced in number; however,
there was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate. Therefore, survival and reproduction were
much better in the following years for the small-billed birds. In the years following this El Niño, the Grants measured beak
sizes in the population and found that the average bill size was smaller. Since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with
smaller bills had more offspring and the size of bills had evolved to be smaller. As conditions improved in 1987 and larger

seeds became more available, the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased.
