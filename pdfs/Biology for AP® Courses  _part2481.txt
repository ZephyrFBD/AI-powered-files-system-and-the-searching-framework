rried out only by prokaryotes. As illustrated in Figure 22.19, prokaryotes are key to the
nitrogen cycle. The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this
nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or “fixed” into more readily
available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation. Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to
other forms.
Another source of ammonia is ammonification, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of
nitrogen-containing organic compounds. Ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the
total nitrogen released; the rest is as N2 and N2O. Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding N2
as the final product. Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrification in soils is carried out
by bacteria belonging to the genera Nitroso
