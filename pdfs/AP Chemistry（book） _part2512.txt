 the English chemist Thomas Lowry (1874–1936) independently proposed 
a more general definition of acids and bases. Their concept is based on the fact that acid–
base reactions involve the transfer of H+ ions from one substance to another. To understand this 
definition better, we need to examine the behavior of the H+ ion in water more closely.
The h+ Ion in Water
We might at first imagine that ionization of HCl in water produces just H+ and Cl -. A 
hydrogen ion is no more than a bare proton—a very small particle with a positive charge. 
As such, an H+ ion interacts strongly with any source of electron density, such as the 
nonbonding electron pairs on the oxygen atoms of water molecules. For example, the 
interaction of a proton with water forms the hydronium ion, H3O+1aq2:

The behavior of H+ ions in liquid water is complex because hydronium ions interact 
with additional water molecules via the formation of hydrogen bonds.
