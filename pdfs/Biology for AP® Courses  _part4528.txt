62. Compare and contrast density-dependent growth
regulation with density-independent growth regulation.
Give an example of each as they might affect a caterpillar
population.

a.
Both are environmental conditions that result in
changes in population numbers. Density-
independent factors have different effects on
population densities whereas density-dependent
factors have the sam
