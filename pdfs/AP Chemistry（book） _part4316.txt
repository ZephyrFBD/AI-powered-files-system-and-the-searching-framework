hat define each lattice 
point in a crystal lattice. Beginning from any lattice point, it is 
possible to move to any other lattice point by adding together 
whole-number multiples of the two lattice vectors. (Section 12.2)
law of conservation of mass The total mass of materials present 
after a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass present 
before the reaction. (Section 2.1)
law of constant composition A law that states that the elemental 
composition of a compound is always the same; also called the 
law of definite proportions. (Section 1.2)
law of definite proportions A law that states that the elemental 
composition of a substance is always the same; also called the 
law of constant composition. (Section 1.2)
law of mass action The rules by which the equilibrium constant 
is expressed in terms of the concentrations of reactants and 
products, in accordance with the balanced chemical equation 
for the reaction. (Section 15.2)
law of multiple proportions If two elements A
