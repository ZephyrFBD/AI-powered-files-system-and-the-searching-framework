ption because enhancers would
not be able to bind to transcription factors
c.
increased transcription because repressors would
not be able to bind to promoter regions
d.
increased transcription because RNA
polymerase would be able to increase binding to
promoter regions

13. Gene A is thought to be associated with color
blindness. The protein corresponding to gene A is isolated.
Analysis of the protein recovered shows there are actually
two different proteins that differ in molecular weight that
correspond to gene A. What is one reason why there may
