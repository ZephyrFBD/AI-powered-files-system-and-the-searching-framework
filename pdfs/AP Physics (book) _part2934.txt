A fantasy supertrain. A very fast train with a “proper
length” of
(measured by people at rest on the train) is passing through
a tunnel that is 200 m long according to observers on the ground. Let us imagine
the train’s speed to be so great that the train fits completely within the tunnel as
seen by observers on the ground. That is, the engine is just about to emerge from
one end of the tunnel at the time the last car disappears into the other end. What
is the train’s speed?
APPROACH Since the train just fits inside the tunnel, its length measured by
the person on the ground is
The length contraction formula,
Eq. 26–3a or b, can thus be used to solve for v.
SOLUTION Substituting
and
into Eq. 26–3a gives
dividing both sides by 500 m and squaring, we get
or
and
NOTE No real train could go this fast. But it is fun to think about.
NOTE An observer on the train would not see the two ends of
