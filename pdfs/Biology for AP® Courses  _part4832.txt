29. One method used to calculate contemporary extinction
rates is based on the recorded extinction of species in the
last 500 years. A second method is a calculation based on
the rate of habitat destruction. The construction of a new
dam is being projected. A team of conservation biologists
is preparing a report on the environmental impact of the
dam. Decide which of the two methods should be adopted
to estimate the effect of the construction of the extinction
rate in the area and analyze the advantages and
disadvantages of each method.
a.
The extinction rates calculation method should
be adopted. It is based on a large number of
observations and measurements but
overestimates rates of extinction. The rate of
habitat destruction calculation method uses
species-area curves, but underestimates the rate
of extinction.
b.
The extinction rates calculation method should
be adopted. It is based on a large number of
observations and measurements, but
