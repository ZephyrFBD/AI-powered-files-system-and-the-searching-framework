o conclude that these cells will stay in the G1
phase (specifically in an extension of G1 called G0) phase. This is a reading comprehension question. The
passage states that cells that do not divide are arrested at the G1 phase. Choice (A) is incorrect because these
cells will not be committed to go through cell division. You can also eliminate (C) and (D), as the cells will not
enter the M or S phase.
53. D
Since Snippeiq has the most differences with the other organisms, it is the outgroup, and it must be at position
S.
54. C
Position III, (C), contains the oldest common ancestor because it is the node for all the current species
designated by the lettered positions.
55. A
Snippeiq, (A), is the out-group because it is the least related to the other species. The table shows that Snippeiq
has the most differences with all of the other species.
56. D
Snorflak and Fixxels, (D), would have the most shared derived characters because they have the fewest amino
acid differences. Snippeiq and
