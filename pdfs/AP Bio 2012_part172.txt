s will not change, so q is the square 
root of 0.12, or 0.35.

The correct answer could be any value from 1.4â€“1.7 months. Note: The data are reflective 
of actual data. To calculate the lag time in months between the change in the densities 
of the prey and the predator populations, calculate the differences between the prey 
and predator peaks or valleys. The first peak of oscillation is the prey at 4.8 months; the 
predator hits the first peak at approximately 6.5 months. The first valley of oscillation is 
the prey at 8.5 with the second at 10. When calc
