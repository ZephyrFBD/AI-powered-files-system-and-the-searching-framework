frame of the wheel—that is, we are moving to the right with velocity relative to
the ground. In this reference frame the axle C is at rest, whereas the ground and
point P are moving to the left with velocity 
as shown. In Fig. 8–8b we are
seeing pure rotation. So we can use Eq. 8–4 to obtain 
where r is the
radius of the wheel. This is the same v as in Fig. 8–8a, so we see that the linear
speed v of the axle relative to the ground is related to the angular velocity 
of the
wheel by
[rolling without slipping]
This relationship is valid only if there is no slipping.
Bicycle. A bicycle slows down uniformly from 
to rest over a distance of 115 m, Fig. 8–9. Each wheel and tire has an overall
diameter of 68.0 cm. Determine (a) the angular velocity of the wheels at the 
initial instant 
(b) the total number of revolutions each wheel rotates
before coming to rest; (c) the angular acceleration of the wheel; and (d) the time
it took to come to a stop.
APPROACH We assume the bicycle wheels ro
