rely on a variety of environmental stimuli:
 
Water is an essential stimulus for seed germination. When seeds imbibe water, enzymes are activated that initiate
cellular respiration. Other enzymes then direct germination and development. Water may also be necessary to leech
chemicals that inhibit germination.
Oxygen is required for aerobic cellular respiration.
Temperature may also be a stimulus. A minimum temperature may be necessary for enzyme function, but a higher
temperature, sustained over a minimum number of days, may be required to signal that winter is over. Other seeds
require a specific temperature regime, such as continuous cold for a minimum length of time, before responding to a
warm temperature stimulus.
Fire is a common stimulus for species that grow in habitats where wildfires are common. Seeds that germinate after
wildfires have better exposure to sunlight and do not need to compete with established vegetation for water. Also,
nutrients from burned vegetation have beco
