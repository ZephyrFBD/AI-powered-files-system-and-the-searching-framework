it to form long chains.

allowing it to form long chains.
c.
Carbon can form more than four covalent bonds,

27. What property of carboxyl makes carboxyl containing
molecules hydrophilic? Which macromolecules contain
carboxyl?
a.
Carboxyl groups release H+ , making its parent
molecule hydrophilic. It is found amino acids
and fatty acids.
b.
Carboxyl groups absorb H+
ion, making its
parent molecule hydrophilic. It is found in
phospholipids and triglycerides.
c.
Carboxyl groups release OH−, making its
parent molecule hydrophilic. It is found in
phospholipids phosphates and triglycerides
d.
Carboxyl groups release OH−, making its
parent molecule hydrophilic. It is found in
phospholipids and DNA.
28. Compare and contrast saturated and unsaturated
triglycerides.
a.
Saturated triglycerides contain single bonds and
are solids at room tem
