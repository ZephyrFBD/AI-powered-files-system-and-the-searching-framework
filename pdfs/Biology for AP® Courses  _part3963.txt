ivating the complement cascade.
Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because
phagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies. Phagocytic enhancement by antibodies
is called opsonization. In a process called complement fixation, IgM and IgG in serum bind to antigens and provide docking
sites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind. The combination of antibodies and complement enhances
opsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens.
Affinity, Avidity, and Cross Reactivity
Not all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability. In fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities
(attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules, as illustrated in Figure
33.25. An antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably, and thus would be
expected to present a mor
