from diploid cells? 
•  How does the process increase gamete diversity? 
•  What are the outcomes from independent assortment and crossing over? 
•  How does the distance between two genes or a gene and a centromere affect cross­
over frequencies? 
Use socks, clay, or pipe cleaners to model meiosis and crossing-over events and mimic 
nondisjunction and the relationship to genetic disorders. See Parts 1 and 4: Modeling 
Mitosis and Meiosis under Materials and Equipment.

■ Part 5: Meiosis and Crossing Over in Sordaria 
In this experiment, students will measure crossover frequencies and genetic outcomes 
in a fungus. Your students will examine Sordaria fimicola asci produced by crossing wild 
type (black) with tan parents. Each ascus contains eight spores. Parental ty
