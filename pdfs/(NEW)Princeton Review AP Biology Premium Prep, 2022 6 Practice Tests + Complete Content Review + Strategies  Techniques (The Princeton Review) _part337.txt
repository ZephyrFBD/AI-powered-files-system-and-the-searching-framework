There are three main types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).
All three types of RNA are key players in the synthesis of proteins:
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a temporary RNA version of a DNA recipe that gets sent to the ribosome.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is produced in the nucleolus, makes up part of the ribosomes. You’ll recall
from our discussion of the cell in Chapter 5 that the ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. We’ll see how
they function a little later on.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) shuttles amino acids to the ribosomes. It is responsible for bringing the appropriate
amino acids into place at the appropriate time. It does this by reading the message carried by the mRNA.
