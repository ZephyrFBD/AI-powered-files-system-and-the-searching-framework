and the exchange of macromolecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.B
Explain the effect of surface 
area-to-volume ratios on 
the exchange of materials 
between cells or organisms 
and the environment.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.B.1
Surface area-to-volume ratios affect the ability 
of a biological system to obtain necessary 
resources, eliminate waste products, acquire or 
dissipate thermal energy, and otherwise exchange 
chemicals and energy with the environment.
