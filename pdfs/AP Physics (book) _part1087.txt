rate.
If the radius is reduced by half, the heart would have to increase the pressure 
by a factor of about
in order to maintain the same blood-flow rate.
The heart must work much harder under these conditions, but usually cannot
maintain the original flow rate. Thus, high blood pressure is an indication both
that the heart is working harder and that the blood-flow rate is reduced.
10–13 Surface Tension and Capillarity
The surface of a liquid at rest behaves in an interesting way, almost as if it were 
a stretched membrane under tension. For example, a drop of water on the end 
of a dripping faucet, or hanging from a thin branch in the early morning dew 
(Fig. 10–33), forms into a nearly spherical shape as if it were a tiny balloon filled
with water. A steel needle can be made to float on the surface of water even though
it is denser than the water. The surface of a liquid acts like it is under tension,
and this tension, acting along the surface, arises from the attractive forces betwe
