8.7 ▶ Exceptions to the Octet Rule  
Recognize that the octet rule is more of a 
guideline than an absolute rule. Exceptions 
to the rule include molecules with an odd 
number of electrons, molecules where large 
differences in electronegativity prevent 
an atom from completing its octet, and 
molecules where an element from period 3 
or below in the periodic table attains more 
than an octet of electrons.
 
8.8 ▶ Strengths and Lengths of  
Covalent Bonds Observe that bond 
strengths and lengths vary with the number 
of shared electron pairs as well as other 
factors.

◀ GIANT CRYSTALS. These gypsum crystals, large enough for people 
to walk on, are composed of CaSO4·2H2O. The ionic bonding between 
calcium and sulfate ions at the atomic scale leads to the characteristic 
crystal shape at the human scale.
