leĴers and stores them as binary digits 0 and 1’. They concluded that
hackers could one day use blood or spit samples to access computer
systems and obtain sensitive data from police forensics labs or infect
genome ﬁles. It is at this level of digital interaction that synthetic
‘vaccines’ need to be seen to get the full picture and that will become
very clear later on. Michael Yeadon said it made no sense to give the
‘vaccine’ to younger people who were in no danger from the ‘virus’.
What was the beneﬁt? It was all downside with potential eﬀects:
