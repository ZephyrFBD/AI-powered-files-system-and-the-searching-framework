ntinodes at both ends. The fundamental 
frequency corresponds to a wavelength equal to twice the 
tube length:
The harmonics have frequencies that are
times the fundamental frequency, just as for
strings.
For a closed tube (closed at one end), the fundamental
corresponds to a wavelength four times the length of the tube:
Only the odd harmonics are present, equal to
times the fundamental frequency.
Sound waves from different sources can interfere with
each other. If two sounds are at slightly different frequencies,
beats can be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in fre-
quency of the two sources.
The Doppler effect refers to the change in pitch of a sound
due to the motion either of the source or of the observer. If source
and observer are approaching each other, the perceived pitch is
higher. If they are moving apart, the perceived pitch is lower.
[*Shock waves and a sonic boom occur when an object
moves at a supersonic speedâ€”faster than the speed of sound.
