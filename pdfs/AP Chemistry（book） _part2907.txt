e water; the region between 200 m 
and 1000 m deep is the “twilight zone,” where visible light is faint. Below 1000 m, the 
ocean is pitch-black and cold, about 4 °C. The transport of heat, salt, and other chemicals 
throughout the ocean is influenced by these changes in the physical properties of seawa-
ter, and in turn the changes in the way heat and substances are transported affects ocean 
currents and the global climate.
The sea is so vast that if the concentration of a substance in seawater is 1 part per 
billion (1 * 10-6 g>kg of water), there is 1 * 1012 kg of the substance in the world ocean. 
Nevertheless, because of high extracting costs, only three substances are obtained from 
seawater in commercially important amounts: sodium chloride, bromine (from bromide 
salts), and magnesium (from its salts).
Absorption of CO2 by the ocean plays a large role in global climate. Because carbon 
dioxide and water form carbonic acid, the H2CO3 concentration in the ocean increases as 
the
