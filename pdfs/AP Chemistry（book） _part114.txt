 any characteristic that allows us to recognize a particular type of matter and to dis-
tinguish it from other types. This book, your body, the air you are breathing, and the 
clothes you are wearing are all samples of matter. We observe a tremendous variety of 
matter in our world, but countless experiments have shown that all matter is comprised 
of combinations of only about 100 substances called elements. One of our major goals 
will be to relate the properties of matter to its composition, that is, to the particular ele-
ments it contains.
Chemistry also provides a background for understanding the properties of matter 
in terms of atoms, the almost infinitesimally small building blocks of matter. Each ele-
ment is composed of a unique kind of atom. We will see that the properties of matter 
relate to both the kinds of atoms the matter contains (composition) and the arrangements 
of these atoms (structure).
In molecules, two or more atoms are joined in specific shapes. Throughout t
