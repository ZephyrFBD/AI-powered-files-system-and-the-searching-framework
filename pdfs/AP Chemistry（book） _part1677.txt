 CO. (b) Calcu-
late the rms speed of NF3 molecules at 25 Â°C. (c) Calculate 
the most probable speed of an ozone molecule in the strato-
sphere, where the temperature is 270 K.
 
10.82  (a) Place the following gases in order of increasing average 
molecular speed at 300 K: CO, SF6, H2S, Cl2, HBr. (b) Cal-
culate the rms speeds of CO and Cl2 molecules at 300 K. 
 
(c) Calculate the most probable speeds of CO and Cl2 mole-
cules at 300 K.
 
10.83 Which one or more of the following statements are true?
(a) O2 will effuse faster than Cl2.
(b) Effusion and diffusion are different names for the same 
process.
(c) Perfume molecules travel to your nose by the process of 
effusion.
(d) The higher the density of a gas, the shorter the mean 
free path.
 
[10.84]  
At constant pressure, the mean free path 1l2 of a gas mol-
ecule is directly proportional to temperature. At constant 
temperature, l is inversely proportional to pressure. If you 
compare two different gas molecules at the same tempera
