t all galaxies appear to be moving away from us.
Are we therefore at the center of the universe? Explain.
11. If you were located in a galaxy near the boundary of our
observable universe, would galaxies in the direction of the
Milky Way appear to be approaching you or receding from
you? Explain.
12. Compare an explosion on Earth to the Big Bang. Consider
such questions as: Would the debris spread at a higher
speed for more distant particles, as in the Big Bang?
Would the debris come to rest? What type of universe
would this correspond to, open or closed?
13. If nothing, not even light, escapes from a black hole, then
how can we tell if one is there?
14. The Earth’s age is often given as about 4.6 billion years.
Find that time on Fig. 33–29. Modern humans have lived
on Earth on the order of 200,000 years. Where is that on
Fig. 33–29?
15. Why were atoms, as opposed to bare nuclei, unable to exist
until hundreds of thousands of years after the Big Bang?
16. (a) Why are Type Ia supernovae
