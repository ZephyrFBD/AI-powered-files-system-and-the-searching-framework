NA fragments) in the gel while the electrophoresis is running, and this is 
instructive for students. It also helps you to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. 
You will still have to use the final stain to see all the bands more clearly. 
The concentration of the stain added to the agarose/buffer is dependent on the voltage 
used for electrophoresis. The stain may be added to the entire volume of the agarose. Just 
add the drops of stain to the agarose, swirl to mix, and pour the gel immediately. Gels 
can be prepared one day ahead of the lab day, if necessary. Gels stained longer than one 
day tend to fade and lose their ability to stain DNA fragments during electrophoresis. 
Refer to Table 1 for addition of stain to either 300 mL or 600 mL of agarose. Stain can be 
added using the dropper bottle. If a calibrated pipette is available, the lid of the dropper 
bottle can be removed for quicker addition of larger volumes. 
CAUTION: Although methylene blue stain is not toxic, we
