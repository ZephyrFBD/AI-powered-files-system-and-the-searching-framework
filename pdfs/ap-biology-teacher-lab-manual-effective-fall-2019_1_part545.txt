 on. In the laboratory, 
scientists use plasmids to insert “genes of interest” into an organism to change the 
organism’s phenotype, thus “transforming” the recipient cell. Using restriction enzymes, 
genes can be cut out of human, animal, or plant DNA and, using plasmids as vectors 
(carriers of genetic information), inserted into bacteria. If transformation is successful, 
the recipient bacteria will express the newly acquired genetic information in its 
phenotype (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Transformation of Bacteria 
In nature, the efficiency of transformation is low and limited to relatively few bacterial 
strains. Also, bacteria can take up DNA only at the end of logarithmic growth; at this 
time, the cells are said to be “competent.” In the lab, you have discovered several ways 
to increase the rate of transformation. Now, rather than just a few bacteria taking up a 
plasmid you want them to use, millions of bacteria can be t
