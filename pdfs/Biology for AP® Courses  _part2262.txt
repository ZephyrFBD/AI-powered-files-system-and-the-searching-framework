the pathway of evolution probably includes the
fewest major events that coincide with the evidence at hand. Starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of
organisms, scientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those
traits.
Head to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32species) to learn how maximum parsimony is used to create
phylogenetic trees.
What do phylogenetic relationships refer to?
a.
the similarities among organisms
b.
the differences among organisms
c.
the evolution of the shape, size and number of body parts
d.
the relative times in the past that species shared common ancestors
These tools and concepts are only a few of the strategies scientists use to tackle the task of revealing the evolutionary history
of life on Earth. Recently, newer technologies have uncovered surprising discoveries with unexpected relationships, such as
the fact that people seem to be more closely related to fungi than fun
