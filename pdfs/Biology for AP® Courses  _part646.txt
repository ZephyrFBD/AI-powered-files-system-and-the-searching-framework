6.1 | Energy and Metabolism
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are metabolic pathways?
•
What are the differences between anabolic and catabolic pathways?
•
How do chemical reactions play a role in energy transfer?
Connection for AP® Courses
All living systems, from simple cells to complex ecosystems, require free energy to conduct cell processes such as growth
and reproduction.
Organisms have evolved various strategies to capture, store, transform, and transfer free energy. A cell’s metabolism refers
to the chemical reactions that occur within it. Some metabolic reactions involve the breaking down of complex molecules
into simpler ones with a release of energy (catabolism), whereas other metabolic reactions require energy to build complex
