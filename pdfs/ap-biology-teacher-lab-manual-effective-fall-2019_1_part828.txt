■ STEEPNESS OR SLOPE OF A LINE GRAPH 
Look at the graph in Figure A.8 for the disappearance of A in a chemical reaction. Such a 
graph, in which the amount of some quantity is shown on the vertical scale, or ordinate, 
with time shown on the horizontal scale, or abscissa, is frequently called a “progress 
graph” or “progressive curve,” because it shows how some process progresses in time. 
This graph may also be called a “time course” for the process because it shows the extent 
to which the process has occurred at different times.
