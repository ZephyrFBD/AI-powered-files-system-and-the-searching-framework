rs used a machine
simulating human breathing to establish that masks shed up to
nearly 4,000 microplastic ﬁbres in a month with reused masks
producing more. Scientists said some masks are laced with toxic
chemicals and a variety of compounds seriously restricted for both
health and environmental reasons. They include cobalt (used in blue
dye) and formaldehyde known to cause watery eyes, burning
