 were not previously being selected for.
Gene flow can occur between different populations of the same species if individuals migrate to/from the
populations. In other words, new alleles are entering/exiting and the genetic diversity will change. Small populations
are more susceptible than large populations to this type of change.
Phenotypes Not Genotypes
Remember, it is a phenotype that can be selected for/against. It is not the
genotype. Genotypes are hidden away inside the DNA; only the phenotype will
be exposed to the environmental pressures.
Types of Selection
The situation with our moths is an example of directional selection. One of the phenotypes was favored at one of
the extremes of the normal distribution.
In other words, directional selection “weeds out” one of the phenotypes. In our case, dark moths were favored, and
light moths were practically eliminated. Here’s one more thing to remember: directional selection can happen only if
the appropriate allele—the one that is fav
