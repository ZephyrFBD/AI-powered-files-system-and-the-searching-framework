 specifically the anthropogenic (meaning, caused by humans) warming trend presently underway, is
recognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss. Scientists
disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from 15 percent to 40 percent
of species committed to extinction by 2050. Scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter regional climates,
including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them. The warming trend
will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species to move with their adapted climate norms

while facing habitat gaps along the way. The shifting ranges will impose new competitive regimes on species as they find
themselves in contact with other species
