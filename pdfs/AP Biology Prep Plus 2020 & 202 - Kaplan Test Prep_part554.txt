processes, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis,
diﬀerentiation, and enzyme activity. By adding a phosphate group (via
kinase) and/or removing a phosphate group (via phosphatase),
phosphorylation and its reverse, dephosphorylation, can activate or
inactivate a protein. Similarly, ubiquitination adds ubiquitin, a small
regulatory protein, which acts as a signal that turns transcription levels
on, oﬀ, up, or down. Glycosylation—the attaching of a carbohydrate
molecule—promotes protein folding, improves protein stability, and is
involved in immune recognition.

Restriction Enzyme Analysis of DNA
Investigation
This experiment involves splicing DNA using restriction enzymes and
visualizing these fragments using gel electrophoresis. A gel is a matrix
composed of a polymer that acts like filter paper. Think of the gel as a
thick, tangled jungle. DNA fragments are negatively charged, so they will
move away from the negative pole of an applied current and move
