oacidosis keeps pH level of blood constant which disrupts biological processes.

So how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances (a human drinking orange
juice, for example) and survive? Buffers are the key. Buffers readily absorb excess H+ or OH–, keeping the pH of the body
carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person’s
well-being. The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate ion (HCO3–), and
carbon dioxide (CO2). When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, hydrogen ions
are removed, moderating pH changes. Similarly, as shown in Figure 2.21, excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon
