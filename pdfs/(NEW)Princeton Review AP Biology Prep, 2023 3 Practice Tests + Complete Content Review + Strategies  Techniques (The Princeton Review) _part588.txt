 DNA replication, translocation
(the transfer of part of a chromosome to another chromosome), and transcription (the synthesis of RNA from
DNA) all occur in the nucleus.

Crossing-over permits scientists to determine chromosome mapping. Chromosome mapping is a detailed map
of all the genes on a chromosome. The frequency of crossing-over between any two alleles is proportional to
the distance between them. The farther apart the two linked alleles are on a chromosome, the more often the
chromosome will break between them. Crossing-over does not tell us about the chance of variation in zygotes,
the rate of mutations, or whether the traits are dominant, recessive, or masked.

In this scenario, the inside of the cell is hypertonic to the outside environmentâ€”this will cause water to move
into the cell and can cause the cell to lyse.

The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that these birds have different ecological niches. An
ecological niche is the position or func
