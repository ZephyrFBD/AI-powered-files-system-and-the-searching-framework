Over many generations, two populations of the same species can diverge into separate species through 
reproductive isolation. The figures below represent a model of speciation and show the results of matings between 
individuals from two diverging populations at four different stages of speciation. The males represented in the model 
are heterogametic, which means they have two different sex-determining chromosomes, (e.g., XY). The females are 
homogametic, which means they have two similar sex-determining chromosomes, (e.g., XX). The offspring from 
each mating are labeled interpopulation hybrids.  
Figure 1 shows the results of a mating between a male and a female from the two populations. In each subsequent 
figure, the males are from one of the diverging p
