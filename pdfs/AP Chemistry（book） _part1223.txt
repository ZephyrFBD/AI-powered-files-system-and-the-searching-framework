S
The dots are placed on the four sides of the symbol—top, bottom, left, and right—and 
each side can accommodate up to two electrons. All four sides are equivalent, which 
means that the choice of sides for placement of two electrons rather than one electron 
is arbitrary. In general, we spread out the dots as much as possible. In the Lewis symbol 
for S, for instance, we prefer the dot arrangement shown rather than the arrangement 
having two electrons on three of the sides and none on the fourth.
The electron configurations and Lewis symbols for the main-group elements of 
periods 2 and 3 are shown in Figure 8.2. Notice that the number of valence electrons in 
any representative element is the same as the element’s group number. For example, the 
Lewis symbols for oxygen and sulfur, members of group 6A, both show six dots.
The Octet Rule
Atoms often gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as 
the noble gas closest to
