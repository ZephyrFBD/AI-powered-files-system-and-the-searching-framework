.
(C) Hormones and neurotransmitters are transferred between adjacent ganglia.
(D) Lentil beans provide small openings for gases to pass into the woody stem.
Now, if this were a fill-in-the-blank-style question, you might be in a heap of trouble. But let’s take a look at what
we’ve got. You see “woody stems” and “buds” in the question, which leads you to conclude that the question is
about plants. Right away, you know the answer is not (A) or (C) because plants don’t have lungs or ganglia. Now
you’ve narrowed it down to (B) and (D). Notice that (B) and (D) look very similar. Obviously, one of them is a trap.
At this point, if you don’t know what “lentil beans” are, you have to guess. However, even if you don’t know
precisely what they are, it’s safe to say that you probably know that lentil beans have nothing to do with gas
exchange in plants. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
Process of Elimination (POE) is the best way to approach the multiple-choice questions.
Even if you don’t
