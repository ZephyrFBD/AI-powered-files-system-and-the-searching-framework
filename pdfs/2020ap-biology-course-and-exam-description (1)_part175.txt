 
hereditary information—
a.	DNA is synthesized in the 5’ to 3’ direction.
b.	Replication is a semiconservative  
process—that is, one strand of DNA 
serves as the template for a new strand 
of complementary DNA.
c.	Helicase unwinds the DNA strands.
d.	Topoisomerase relaxes supercoiling in front 
of the replication fork. 
e.	DNA polymerase requires RNA primers to 
initiate DNA synthesis.
f.	 DNA polymerase synthesizes new strands of 
DNA continuously on the leading strand and 
discontinuously on the lagging strand.
g.	Ligase joins the fragments on the 
lagging strand.

EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The names of the 
steps and particular enzymes involved—beyond 
DNA polymerase, ligase, RNA polymerase, 
helicase, and topoisomerase—are beyond the 
scope of the course and the AP Exam.
