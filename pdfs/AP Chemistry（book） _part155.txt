The watt (W) is the SI unit of power, which is the rate at which energy is either generated or consumed. 
The SI unit of energy is the joule (J); 1 J = 1 kg # m2>s2 and 1 W = 1 J>s.
bGreek letter mu, pronounced “mew.”
With SI units, prefixes are used to indicate decimal fractions or multiples of various 
units. For example, the prefix milli- represents a 10-3 fraction, one-thousandth, of a unit: A 
milligram (mg) is 10-3 gram (g), a millimeter (mm) is 10-3 meter (m), and so forth. Table 1.4 
presents the prefixes commonly encountered in chemistry. In using SI units and in working 
problems throughout this text, you must be comfortable using exponential notation. If you 
are unfamiliar with exponential notation or want to review it, refer to Appendix A.1.
