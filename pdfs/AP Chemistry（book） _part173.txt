gical diseases. We all have prion proteins in our brains, and for nearly all 
of us, they cause no harmful effects. For a small fraction of people, though, 
something causes the prions to change form and to adopt an incorrectly 
folded molecular shape. This process, once begun, is cumulative, propa-
gating throughout the brain; the misfolded proteins somehow trigger the 
same misfolding in other prion proteins. Eventually, the misfolded proteins 
aggregate into clusters that can destroy neurons, producing symptoms such 
as those seen in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Matter, Energy, and Measurement
1.6 ∣ Uncertainty in Measurement
Two kinds of numbers are encountered in scientific work: exact numbers (those whose values 
are known exactly) and inexact numbers (those whose values have some uncertainty). Most of 
the exact numbers we will encounter in this book have defined values. For example, there are 
exactly 12 eggs in a dozen, exactly 1000 g in a
