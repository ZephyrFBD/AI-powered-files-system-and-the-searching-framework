uon traveling at 65% the
speed of light. The two muons (each of mass 
)
annihilate, and produce how much electromagnetic energy?
43. (II) Two identical particles of mass m approach each other
at equal and opposite speeds, v. The collision is completely
inelastic and results in a single particle at rest. What is the
mass of the new particle? How much energy was lost in the
collision? How much kinetic energy was lost in this collision?
44. (III) The americium nucleus,
decays to a neptunium
nucleus,
by emitting an alpha particle of mass
4.00260 u and kinetic energy 5.5 MeV. Estimate the mass
of the neptunium nucleus, ignoring its recoil, given that the
americium mass is 241.05682 u.
45. (III) Show that the kinetic energy ke of a particle of mass m
is related to its momentum p by the equation
*46. (III) What magnetic field B is needed to keep 998-GeV
protons revolving in a circle of radius 1.0 km? Use the
relativistic mass. The proton’s “rest mass” is
