identity in their genomes (a.k.a clones)
can eventually appear different if they express their genes differently in response to different environmental conditions, for
example. Even among humans, identical twins can possess different birthmarks, wrinkles, or other features that arise during
development sometimes due to differential gene expression.
The regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of energy for an
organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required.
In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly
coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in
every cell all the time.
The control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead
to the development o
