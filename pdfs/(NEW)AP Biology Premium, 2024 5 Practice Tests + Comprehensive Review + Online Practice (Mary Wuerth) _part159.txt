ual 1. R is constant for all four solutions. So the water potential will be inversely proportional
to the concentration of the solute (if there is less concentrated solute, the water potential will be higher). The
least concentrated solute in this question is 0.5 molar, so choice (A) would have the highest water potential.
Note that if you read this question carefully and understand how each variable affects water potential, you donâ€™t
have to actually calculate the water potential for each solution.
7. (D) A fish that is adapted to a freshwater environment likely has a water potential that is more similar to
freshwater than to saltwater. The freshwater fish would likely have a higher water potential than the saltwater.
Water flows from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, so water would flow out of
the fish into its new surroundings. Choices (A) and (C) are incorrect because the fish would likely lose water,
not gain water. Choice (B) is incorrect because
