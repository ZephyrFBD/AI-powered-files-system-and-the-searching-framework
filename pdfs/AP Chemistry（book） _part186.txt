Rounding off 4.735 to three significant figures gives 4.74, and rounding 2.376 to 
two significant figures gives 2.4.*
*Your instructor may want you to use a slight variation on the rule when the leftmost digit to be 
removed is exactly 5, with no following digits or only zeros following. One common practice is to 
round up to the next higher number if that number will be even and down to the next lower num-
ber otherwise. Thus, 4.7350 would be rounded to 4.74, and 4.7450 would also be rounded to 4.74.
Give It Some Thought
The mass of a glass beaker is known to be 25.1 g. Approximately 5 mL of water are 
added, and the mass of the beaker and water is measured on an analytical balance 
to be 30.625 g. How many significant figures are there in the mass of
