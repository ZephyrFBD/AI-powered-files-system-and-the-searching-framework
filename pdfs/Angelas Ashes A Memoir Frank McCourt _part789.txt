 Five shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they’re rich charge more but 
 
 that’s what I’m charging so don’t be going around on your bicycle and 
 
 puttin’ me out of business with low prices.We have to give Peter something 
 
 or he’ll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans. 
 
 Some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I’m 
 
 rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter 
 
 the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the 
 
 post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper 
 
 of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the 
 
 sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She’s not happy I’m a 
 
 messenger boy because that’s the lowest you can drop in Limerick but 
 
 if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She 
 
 doesn’t know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and 
 
 she’d die if she knew what I was earning from
