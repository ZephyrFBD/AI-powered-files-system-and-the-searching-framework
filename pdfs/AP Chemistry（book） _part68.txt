e 18.4, 
showing the UV absorption spectrum of ozone, has been added 
so students can understand its role in filtering out harmful UV 
radiation from the sun. A new Sample Exercise (18.3) walks stu-

produced from combustion of a hydrocarbon.
In Chapter 19 we have substantially rewritten the early sec-
tions to help students better understand the concepts of spon-
taneous, nonspontaneous, reversible, and irreversible processes 
and their relationships. These improvements have led to a 
clearer definition of entropy.
To the Student
Chemistry: The Central Science, Fourteenth Edition, has been 
written to introduce you to modern chemistry. As authors, 
we have, in effect, been engaged by your instructor to help 
you learn chemistry. Based on the comments of students and 
instructors who have used this book in its previous editions, we

the text to continue to evolve
