Answer Explanations
Section I
1. (B) Ionic compounds have both positive and negative ions. Water is polar, and it has a partially negative end
and a partially positive end. When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the partially negative ends of the water
molecules are attracted to the positive ions of the ionic compound, and the partially positive ends of the water
molecules are attracted to the negative ions of the ionic compound. Choices (A) and (C) are both incorrect
because water is polar, not nonpolar. While hydrogen bonds will form between water molecules, hydrogen
bonds do not form between water molecules and ions, so c
