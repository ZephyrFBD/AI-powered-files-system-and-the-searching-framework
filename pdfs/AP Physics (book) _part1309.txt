The relative amplitudes of the overtones for a given note are different for
different musical instruments, which is what gives each instrument its characteristic
quality or timbre. A bar graph showing the relative amplitudes of the harmonics
for a given note produced by an instrument is called a sound spectrum. Several
typical examples for different musical instruments are shown in Fig. 12–15. The
fundamental usually has the greatest amplitude, and its frequency is what is heard
as the pitch.
