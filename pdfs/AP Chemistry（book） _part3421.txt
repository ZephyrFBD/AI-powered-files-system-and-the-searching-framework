Storage of spent nuclear fuel poses a major problem because the fission products 
are extremely radioactive. It is estimated that 10 half-lives are required for their radioac-
tivity to reach levels acceptable for biological exposure. Based on the 28.8-yr half-life of 
strontium-90, one of the longer-lived and most dangerous of the products, the wastes 
must be stored for nearly 300 yr. Plutonium-239 is one of the by-products present in 
spent fuel elements. It is formed by absorption of a neutron by uranium-238, followed 
by two successive beta emissions. (Remember that most of the uranium in the fuel ele-
ments is uranium-238.) If the elements are reprocessed, the plutonium-239 is largely 
recovered because it can be used as a nuclear fuel. However, if the plutonium is not 
removed, spent elements must be stored for a very long time because plutonium-239 
has a half-life of 24,000 yr.
A fast breeder reactor offers one approach to getting more power out of existing
