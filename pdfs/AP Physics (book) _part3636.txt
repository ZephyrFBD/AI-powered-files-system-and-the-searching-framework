 
GUT and Cosmology
An interesting prediction of unified theories relates to cosmology (Chapter 33).
It was thought by many theorists that during the first 
s after the theorized
Big Bang that created the universe, the temperature was so extremely high that
particles had energies corresponding to the unification scale. Baryon number
would not have been conserved then, perhaps allowing an imbalance that might
account for the observed predominance of matter 
over antimatter
in the universe. The fact that we are surrounded by matter, with no sig-
nificant antimatter in sight, is considered a problem in search of an explanation
(not given by the Standard Model). We call this the matter;antimatter problem.
To understand it may require still undiscovered phenomenaâ€”perhaps related to
quarks or neutrinos, or the Higgs boson or supersymmetry (next Section).
Many theorists no longer think the Big Bang was sufficiently hot to create
unification. Nonetheless we see that there is a deep connection
