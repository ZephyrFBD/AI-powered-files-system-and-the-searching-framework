u to short online videos that show how 
to prepare an agarose gel, load DNA samples into the wells in the gel, and run an 
electrophoresis. 
Step 1 Seal the ends of the gel-casting tray with tape, dams, or any other method 
appropriate for the gel box that you are using. Insert the well-forming comb. Place the 
gel-casting tray out of the way on the lab bench so that the agarose poured in the next 
step can set undisturbed. (Your teacher might cast the gel for you ahead of time.) 
Step 2 Carefully pour the liquid gel into the casting tray to a depth of 5–6 mm. The gel 
should cover only about one-half the height of the comb teeth (Figure 3). While the gel is 
still liquid, use the tip of a pipette to remove any bubbles.

Mix agarose 
and buffer. 
1. 
Boil mixture 
in microwave. 
2. 
Cool the mixture to 65˚C 
and pour into mold. 
3. 
Gel solidiﬁes at 
room temperature. 
Insert comb into 
mold to make wells. 
Remove comb; 
wells remain.
