nal sample of NOBr?
 15.77 Consider the hypothetical reaction A1g2 ∆ 2 B1g2. A 
flask is charged with 0.75 atm of pure A, after which it is 
allowed to reach equilibrium at 0 °C. At equilibrium, the 
partial pressure of A is 0.36 atm. (a) What is the total pres-
sure in the flask at equilibrium? (b) What is the value of 
Kp? (c) What could we do to maximize the yield of B?
 15.78 As shown in Table 15.2, the equilibrium constant 
for the reaction N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2 is 
Kp = 4.34 * 10-3 at 300 °C. Pure NH3 is placed in a 1.00-L 
flask and allowed to reach equilibrium at this tempera-
ture. There are 1.05 g NH3 in the equilibrium mixture. 
 
(a) What are the masses of N2 and H2 in the equilibrium 
mixture? (b) What was the initial mass of ammonia placed 
in the vessel? (c) What is the total pressure in the vessel?
