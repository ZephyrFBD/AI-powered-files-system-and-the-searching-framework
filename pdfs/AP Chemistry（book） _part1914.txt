rus atoms (known as dopants) replace silicon atoms in a silicon crystal. In pure Si, all of

the valence-band molecular orbitals are filled and all of the conduction-band molecular 
orbitals are empty, as Figure 12.31(a) shows. Because phosphorus has five valence elec-
trons but silicon has only four, the “extra” electrons that come with the dopant phos-
phorus atoms are forced to occupy the conduction band [Figure 12.31(b)]. The doped 
material is called an n-type semiconductor, n signifying that the number of negatively 
charged electrons in the conduction band has increased. These extra electrons can move 
very easily in the conduction band. Thus, just a few parts per million (ppm) of phospho-
rus in silicon can increase silicon’s intrinsic conductivity by a factor of a million!
The dramatic change in conductivity in response to the addition of a t
