Electrons having opposite spins are said to be paired when they are in the same 
orbital 1
2
2. An unpaired electron is one not accompanied by a partner of opposite spin. In 
the lithium atom the two electrons in the 1s orbital are paired and the electron in the 2s 
orbital is unpaired.
Hund’s Rule
Consider now how the electron configurations of the elements change as we move from 
element to element across the periodic table.
Hydrogen Hydrogen has one electron, which occupies the 1s orbital in its ground state:
H
1s
: 1s1
The choice of a spin-up electron here is arbitrary; we could equally well show the ground 
state with one spin-down electron. It is customary, however, to show unpaired electrons 
with their spins up.
Helium The next element, helium, has two electrons. Because two electrons with oppo-
site spins can occupy the same orbital, both of helium’s electrons are in the 1s orbital:
He
1s
: 1s2
The two electrons present in helium complete the filling of the
