lasma membrane wraps
around the solid material and engulfs it, forming a phagocytic vesicle. Phagocytic cells (such as certain white blood
cells) attack and engulf bacteria in this manner.
• Pinocytosis (“cellular drinking”) occurs when dissolved substances enter the cell. The plasma membrane folds
inward to form a channel, allowing the liquid to enter. Subsequently, the plasma membrane closes off the channel,
encircling the liquid inside a vesicle.
• Receptor-mediated endocytosis, a form of pinocytosis, occurs when specific molecules in the fluid surrounding
the cell bind to specialized receptors that concentrate in coated pits in the plasma membrane. The membrane pits, the
receptors, and their specific molecules (called ligands) fold inward, and the formation of a vesicle follows. Proteins
that transport cholesterol in blood (low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs) and certain hormones target specific cells by
receptor-mediated endocytosis.
