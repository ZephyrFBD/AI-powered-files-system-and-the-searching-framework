ipathic (phospholipids are amphipathic). Choice (D) is incorrect because while unsaturated lipids do have
C=C double bonds, saturated lipids do not. Also, both saturated and unsaturated lipids are hydrophobic.
5. (C) A dehydration reaction removes a water molecule. Two glucose molecules would contain 12 carbon atoms,
24 hydrogen atoms, and 12 oxygen atoms, but the dehydration reaction (linking the two glucose molecules to
form maltose) would remove two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to form the water molecule removed in
a dehydration reaction. This leaves 12 carbon atoms but only 22 hydrogen atoms and 11 oxygen atoms. Choice
(A) is incorrect because it has fewer atoms than a single glucose molecule, so it could not be maltose (which is
made from two glucose molecules). Choice (B) is incorrect because it is what would remain if a water molecule
was removed from a single glucose molecule, not from two glucose molecules. Choice (D) is incorrect because
it shows the number of atoms pre
