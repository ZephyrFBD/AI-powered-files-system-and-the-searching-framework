issociation energy is 
339 kJ>mol. In CCl4 the C ¬Cl bond-dissociation energy 
is 293 kJ>mol. What is the range of wavelengths of photons 
that can cause C ¬Cl bond rupture in one molecule but 
not in the other?
 18.19  (a) Distinguish between photodissociation and photoion-
ization. (b) Use the energy requirements of these two pro-
cesses to explain why photodissociation of oxygen is more 
important than photoionization of oxygen at altitudes 
below about 90 km.
 18.20  Why is the photodissociation of N2 in the atmosphere rel-
atively unimportant compared with the photodissociation 
of O2?
 18.21  The wavelength at which the O2 molecule most strongly 
absorbs light is approximately 145 nm. (a) In which region 
of the electromagnetic spectrum does this light fall? 
 
(b) Would a photon whose wavelength is 145 nm have 
enough energy to photodissociate O2 whose bond energy is 
495 kJ/mol? Would it have enough energy to photoionize O2?
 18.22  The ultraviolet spectrum can be divided into
