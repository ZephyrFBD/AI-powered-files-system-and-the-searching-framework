its 0.66 mm apart. The screen is 2.40 m away. A second
source of unknown wavelength produces its second-order
fringe 1.23 mm closer to the central maximum than the
650-nm light. What is the wavelength of the unknown light?
78. Monochromatic light of variable wavelength is incident
normally on a thin sheet of plastic film in air. The reflected
light is a maximum only for
and
in the visible spectrum. What is the thickness of the film
[Hint: Assume successive values of m.]
79. Show that the second- and third-order spectra of white
light produced by a diffraction grating always overlap.
What wavelengths overlap?
80. A radio station operating at 90.3 MHz broadcasts from two
identical antennas at the same elevation but separated by a
9.0-m horizontal distance d, Fig. 24–62. A maximum signal
is found along the midline, perpendicular to d at its midpoint
and extending horizontally in both directions. If the midline
is taken as 0°, at what other angle(s) is a maximum signal
detected? A minimum
