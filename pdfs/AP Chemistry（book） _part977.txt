re known as either transition elements or 
transition metals. Note the position of these elements in the periodic table.
In writing the electron configurations of the transition elements, we fill orbitals in 
accordance with Hund’s rule—we add them to the 3d orbitals singly until all five orbitals 
have one electron each and then place additional electrons in the 3d orbitals with spin 
pairing until the shell is completely filled. The condensed electron configurations and the 
corresponding orbital diagram representations of two transition elements are as follows:
3d
4s
Mn:
Zn:
or    [Ar]
or    [Ar]
[Ar]4s23d5
[Ar]4s23d10

Give It Some Thought
Based on the structure of the periodic table, which becomes occupied first, the 6s 
orbital or the 5d orbitals?
Once all the 3d orbitals have been filled with two electrons each, the 4p orbitals 
begin to be occupied until the completed octet of outer electrons 14s24p62 is reache
