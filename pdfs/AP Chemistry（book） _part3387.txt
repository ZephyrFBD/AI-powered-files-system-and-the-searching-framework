▶Practice Exercise 1
Cesium-137, which has a half-life of 30.2 yr, is a component 
of the radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. If the 
activity due to cesium-137 in a sample of radioactive waste has 
decreased to 35.2% of its initial value, how old is the sample?
(a) 1.04 yr (b) 15.4 yr (c) 31.5 yr (d) 45.5 yr (e) 156 yr
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A wooden object from an archeological site is subjected to 
radiocarbon dating. The activity due to 14C is measured to be 
11.6 disintegrations per second. The activity of a carbon sam-
ple of equal mass from fresh wood is 15.2 disintegrations per 
second. The half-life of 14C is 5700 yr. What is the age of the 
archeological sample?
