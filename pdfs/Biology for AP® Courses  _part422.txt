various organelles work together, similar to how your bodyâ€™s organs work together to keep you
healthy.) Like prokaryotes, all eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. Many organelles
are bound by membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers embedded with proteins to compartmentalize functions such
as the storage of hydrolytic enzymes and the synthesis of proteins. The nucleus houses DNA, and the nucleolus within the
nucleus is the site of ribosome assembly. Functional ribosomes are found either free in the cytoplasm or attached to the
rough endoplasmic reticulum where they perform protein synthesis. The Golgi apparatus receives, modifies, and packages
small molecules like lipids and proteins for distribution. Mitochondria and chloroplasts participate in free energy capture
and transfer through the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. Peroxisomes oxidize fatty acids
and amino acids, and they are equipped to break down hydrogen
