tion 16.6, we calculated that a 0.30 M solu-
tion of CH3COOH has a pH of 2.64, corresponding to 
3H+4 = 2.3 * 10-3 M. Thus, the addition of CH3COONa has sub-
stantially decreased 3H+4, as we expect from Le Châtelier’s principle.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
For the generic equilibrium HA1aq2 ∆ H+ 1aq2 + A-1aq2, 
which of these statements is true?
(a) The equilibrium constant for this reaction changes as the 
pH changes.
(b) If you add the soluble salt KA to a solution of HA that is at 
equilibrium, the concentration of HA would decrease.
(c) If you add the soluble salt KA to a solution of HA that is at 
equilibrium, the concentration of A- would decrease.
(d) If you add the soluble salt KA to a solution of HA that is at 
equilibrium, the pH would increase.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the pH of a solution containing 0.085 M nitrous 
acid 1HNO2, Ka = 4.5 * 10-42 and 0.10 M potassium nitrite 
1KNO22.
Now we can use the equilibrium-constant expression:
