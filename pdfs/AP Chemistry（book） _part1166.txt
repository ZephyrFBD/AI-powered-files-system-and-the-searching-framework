ct with bases to form salts and 
water. Metalloids have properties that are intermediate between 
those of metals and nonmetals.
TRENDS FOR GROUP 1A AND 2A METALS (SECTION 7.7) The pe-
riodic properties of the elements can help us understand the proper-
ties of groups of the representative elements. The alkali metals (group 
1A) are soft metals with low densities and low melting points. They 
have the lowest ionization energies of the elements. As a result, they 
are very reactive toward nonmetals, easily losing their outer s elec-
tron to form 1+ ions.
The alkaline earth metals (group 2A) are harder and denser, and 
have higher melting points than the alkali metals. They are also very 
reactive toward nonmetals, although not as reactive as the alkali met-
als. The alkaline earth metals readily lose their two outer s electrons 
to form 2+ ions. Both alkali and alkaline earth metals react with hy-
drogen to form ionic substances that contain the hydride ion, H-.
