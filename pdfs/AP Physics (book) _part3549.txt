is Chapter, and cosmology
and astrophysics in Chapter 33.These are subjects at the forefront of knowledge—
elementary particles treats the smallest objects in the universe; cosmology treats
the largest (and oldest) aspects of the universe. The reader who wants an under-
standing of the great beauties of present-day science (and its limits) will want to
read these Chapters. So will those who want to be good citizens, even if there is
not time to cover them in a physics course.
