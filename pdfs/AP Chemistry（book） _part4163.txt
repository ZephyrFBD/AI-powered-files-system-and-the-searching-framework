Iodic acid, by analogy to the relationship between the chlorate ion 
and chloric acid page 71 No, it contains three different elements.

page 84 Each Mg1OH22 has 1 Mg, 2 O, and 2 H; thus, 3 Mg1OH22 
represents 3 Mg, 6 O, and 6 H. page 89 The product is an ionic 
compound involving Na+ and S2 -, and its chemical formula is 
therefore Na2S. page 94 (a) A mole of glucose. By inspecting their 
chemical formulas we find that glucose has more atoms of H and 
O than water and in addition it also has C atoms. Thus, a molecule 
of glucose has a greater mass than a molecule of water. (b) They 
both contain the same number of molecules because a mole of each 
substance contains 6.02 * 1023 molecules. page 99 No, chemi-
cal analysis cannot distinguish compounds that have different 
molecular formulas but the same empirical formula. page 103
