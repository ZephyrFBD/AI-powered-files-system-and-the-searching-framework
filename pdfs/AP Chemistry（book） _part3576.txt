ers, are the type most 
often used in commercial materials.
Composite materials that take advantage of the strength, sta-
bility, and low density of carbon fibers are widely used. Compos-
ites are combinations of two or more materials. These materials are 
present as separate phases and are combined to form structures that 
take advantage of certain desirable properties of each component. In 
carbon composites, the graphite fibers are often woven into a fabric 
that is embedded in a matrix that binds them into a solid structure. 
The fibers transmit loads evenly throughout the matrix. The finished 
composite is thus stronger than any one of its components.
Carbon composite materials are used widely in a number 
of applications, including high-performance graphite sports 
equipment such as tennis racquets, golf clubs, and bicycle wheels 
(Figure 22.29). Heat-resistant composites are required for many aero-
space applications, where carbon composites now find wide use.
