lying around screaming, Sin, sin, ’tis a sin. He finishes his 
 
 tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past 
 
  
  
 eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes 
 
 are still damp on my skin. 
 
 On my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the 
 
 lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a 
 
 doctor. She says,What time do you have to be at that job? 
 
 Nine. 
 
 All right. 
 
 309 
 
 She turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. 
 
 She doesn’t say a word and I wonder if she’s going to the post office to 
 
 denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother’s bed and wearing her 
 
 black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting 
 
 for you and you’ll be an hour late. If they want to argue I’ll go up 
 
 and argue. 
 
 Why do I have to be an hour late? 
 
 Do what you’re bloody well told.
