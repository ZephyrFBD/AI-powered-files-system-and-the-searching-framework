less of whether
the reaction is exergonic or endergonic.
b.
The transition state of the reaction exists at a
higher energy level than the reactants. Activation
energy is always positive regardless of whether
the reaction is exergonic or endergonic.
c.
The transition state of the reaction exists at a
lower energy level than the reactants. Activation
energy is always negative regardless of whether
the reaction is exergonic or endergonic.
d.
The transition state of the reaction exists at an
intermediate energy level than that of the
reactants. Activation energy is always positive
regardless of whether the reaction is exergonic
or endergonic.
36. Imagine an elaborate ant farm with tunnels and
passageways through the sand where ants live in a large
community. Now imagine that an earthquake shook the
ground and demolished the ant farm. In which of these two
scenarios, before or after the earthquake, was the ant farm
system in a state of higher or lower entropy? Why?
a.
The ant farm is in the
