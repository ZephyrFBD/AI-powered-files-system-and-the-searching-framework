hreshold potential. (2) If the threshold of
excitation is reached, all Na+ channels open and the membrane depolarizes. (3) At the peak action potential, K+
channels open and K+ begins to leave the cell. At the same time, Na+ channels close. (4) The membrane becomes
hyperpolarized as K+ ions continue to leave the cell. The hyperpolarized membrane is in a refractory period and
cannot fire. (5) The K+ channels close and the Na+/K+ transporter restores the resting potential.

Figure 26.12 The action potential is conducted down the axon as the axon membrane depolarizes, then repolarizes.
This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/actionpotential) presents an overview of action potential.
Myelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential
For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon
terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of conduction of an action potential
