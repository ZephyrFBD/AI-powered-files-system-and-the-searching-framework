s is a trick question because there’s a long way and a very short way to solve this problem. The long way
would be to construct a Punnett square and sort and count all the offspring. The short, easy way is to recognize that a
white flower has the genotype R′R′. Looking at only the color gene for each parent, the cross is RR′ × RR. In order
for a cross to produce a white-flowered offspring (R′R′), both parents must contribute R′. Since this is not the case,
no offspring will be white flowered.
12. C. It is not usually practical to make a Punnett square for genotypes involving more than two genes. In this
problem, you are asked about the frequency of one specific offspring, AABbCcDd. To solve this problem, look at
each gene separately. Looking at the first gene, the parents are AA × AA and all offspring will be AA (frequency of
1). For the second gene, BB × bb, all offspring will be Bb (1). For the third gene, the parents are CC × Cc, which
produces ½ CC and ½ Cc (do a Punnett square to
