e lungs (via the pulmonary artery). Closing of the semilunar valves produces a
monosyllabic “dup” sound.
Figure 31.12 During (a) atrial diastole, the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart. During (b) cardiac diastole,
the heart muscle is relaxed and blood flows into the heart. During (c) atrial systole, the atria contract, pushing blood
into the ventricles.
The pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle.
Cardiomyocytes, shown in Figure 31.13, are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump

rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle.
They are self-stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients
and electrolytes.
