rope and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern
humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and
Papua New Guineans.
Several genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-
day humans. These genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive
development. One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2, which is different in modern day
humans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage,
and dental differences seen in Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was
important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.
