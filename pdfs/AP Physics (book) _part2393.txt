1. What would be the advantage, in Faraday’s experiments
(Fig. 21–1), of using coils with many turns?
2. What is the difference between magnetic flux and magnetic
field?
3. Suppose you are holding a circular ring of wire in front of you
and (a) suddenly thrust a magnet, south pole first, away from
you toward the center of the circle. Is a current induced in
the wire? (b) Is a current induced when the magnet is held
steady within the ring? (c) Is a current induced when you
withdraw the magnet? For each yes answer, specify the
direction. Explain your answers.
4. (a) A wire loop is pulled away from a current-carrying wire
(Fig. 21–47). What is the direction of the induced current
in the loop: clockwise or counterclockwise?
(b) What if the wire loop stays fixed as the
current I decreases? Explain
