e cell.
(A)
tRNAs bind to available single-stranded DNA sequences in
the cell.
(B)
Short ribonucleotide sequences are the primers for DNA
polymerases.
(C)
Short sequences of RNA attached to DNA represent an artifact
of the isolation procedure.
(D)
2. Hormone response elements are short sequences of DNA to which
a hormone-hormone receptor complex can bind. In a mammalian
cell, a mutation inserts an estrogen-response element upstream
of the transcription initiation site of the gene encoding the protein
tubulin. Tubulin is a component of the cytoskeleton.Â Which of the
following results would most likely occur as a result of this
mutation?
The expression of tubulin would become estrogen
responsive.
(A)
Baseline expression of tubulin would increase.
(B)
The amino acid sequence of tubulin would be changed.
(C)
Transcription of the tubulin gene could not undergo
termination.
(D)
3. A researcher wishes to synthesize insulin in vitro and decides to
use a cytoplasmic wheat germ extract that cont
