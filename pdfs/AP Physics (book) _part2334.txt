r the part of the rotating wheel labeled c in Fig. 21–20b, where the magnetic
field is zero but is just about to enter a region where 
points into the page. To oppose
this inward increase in magnetic field, the induced current is counterclockwise 
to produce a field pointing out of the page (right-hand-rule-1). Similarly, region d is
about to move to e, where 
is zero; hence the current is clockwise to produce an
inward field opposed to this decreasing flux inward. These currents are referred
to as eddy currents. They can be present in any conductor that is moving across
a magnetic field or through which the magnetic flux is changing.
In Fig. 21–20b, the magnetic field exerts a force 
on the induced currents it
has created, and that force opposes the rotational motion. Eddy currents can be
used in this way as a smooth braking device on, say, a rapid-transit car. In order
to stop the car, an electromagnet can be turned on that applies its field either to
the wheels or to the moving stee
