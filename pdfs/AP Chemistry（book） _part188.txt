CHAPTER 1 Introduction: Matter, Energy, and Measurement
When a calculation involves two or more steps and you write answers for intermediate 
steps, retain at least one nonsignificant digit for the intermediate answers. This procedure 
ensures that small errors from rounding at each step do not combine to affect the final 
result. When using a calculator, you may enter the numbers one after another, round-
ing only the final answer. Accumulated rounding-off errors may account for small dif-
ferences among results you obtain and answers given in the text for numerical problems.
