FIGURE 32–8 Feynman diagram showing a photon
acting as the carrier of the electromagnetic force
between two electrons. This is sort of an x vs. graph,
with increasing upward. Starting at the bottom, two
electrons approach each other. As they get close,
momentum and energy get transferred from one to
the other, carried by a photon (or more than one),
and the two electrons bounce apart.

Figure 32–8 represents the simplest case in QED, in which a single photon is
exchanged. One of the charged particles emits the photon and recoils somewhat
as a result; and the second particle absorbs the photon. In such a collision or
interaction, energy and momentum are transferred from one charged particle to
the other, carried by the photon. The photon is absorbed by the second particle
after it is emitted by the first particle and is not observable. Hence the photon is
referred to as a virtual photon, in contrast to one that is free and can be detected
