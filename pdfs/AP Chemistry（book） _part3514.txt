 in combination with fluorine, the element we would expect to be 
most reactive in pulling electron density from another atom. Since that time chemists 
have prepared several xenon compounds of fluorine and oxygen (Table 22.1). The fluo-
rides XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6 are made by direct reaction of the elements. By varying the 
ratio of reactants and altering reaction conditions, each of the three compounds can be 
obtained. The oxygen-containing compounds are formed when the fluorides react with 
water as, for example,
 
XeF61s2 + 3 H2O1l2 ¡ XeO31aq2 + 6 HF1aq2 
[22.16]
The other noble-gas elements form compounds much less readily than xenon. For 
many years, only one binary krypton compound, KrF2, was known with certainty, and it 
decomposes to its elements at -10 °C. Other compounds of krypton have been isolated 
at very low temperatures (40 K). In 2000, a compound of argon, HArF
, was discovered, but 
it can exist only in argon matrices at very low temperatures.
