lead to an increase in fern numbers.

A group of students summarized information on five great
extinction events.The students are sampling a site in
search of fossils from the Devonian period. Based on the
chart, which of the following would be the most
reasonable plan for the students to follow?
a.
Searching horizontally rock layers in any class
of rock and trying to find those that contain the
greatest number of fossils.
b.
Collecting fossils from rock layers deposited
prior to the Permian period that contain some
early vertebrate bones.
c.
Looking in sedimentary layers next to bodies of
water in order to find marine fossils of bivalves
and trilobites
d.
Using relative dating techniques to determine the
geological ages of the fossils so they can
calculate the rate of speciation of early
organisms.

Students are sorting fossils of angiosperm pollen grains,
some recovered from layers below the Cretaceous-
Paleogene boundary and some from layers above the
Cretaceous-Paleogene boun
