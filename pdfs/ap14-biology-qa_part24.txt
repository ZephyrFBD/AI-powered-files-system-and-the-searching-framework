selection, i.e., reproductive success. Some students claimed that natural selection acts on 
genotypes or alleles rather than on phenotypes or that evolution occurs in individuals rather than in 
populations over time. Students often used Lamarckian or teleological language when describing 
evolution, (e.g., a changing environment — or predators — would cause natural selection; populations 
need genetic variation to adapt to their environment or to become more fit).  
Based on your experience of student responses at the AP ® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  
Teachers should clarify the difference between changing allele frequencies (over generations) and 
processes that introduce genetic variation at the individual level. Teachers should also differentiate 
between mutations caused during DNA replication and other sources of genetic variation (e.g., crossing 
over and random assort
