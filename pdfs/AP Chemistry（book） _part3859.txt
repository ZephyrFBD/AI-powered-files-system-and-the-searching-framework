Amines and Amides
Amines are compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens of ammonia 1NH32 are 
replaced by an alkyl group:
(CH3)3N
CH3CH2NH2
NH2
Phenylamine
Aniline
Trimethylamine
Ethylamine
Amines are the most common organic bases. 
 (Section 16.7) As we saw in the 
Chemistry Put to Work box in Section 16.8, many pharmaceutically active compounds 
are complex amines:
