entary 
to yellow, this strong absorption in the yellow portion of the visi-
ble spectrum is responsible for the violet color of salts and solutions 
of the ion. What is happening during this absorption of light? The 
MnO4
- ion is a complex of Mn(VII). Because Mn(VII) has a [Ar]3d0 
electron conﬁguration, the absorption cannot be due to a d-d transi-
tion because there are no d electrons to excite! That does not mean, 
however, that the d orbitals are not involved in the transition. The 
excitation in the MnO4
- ion is due to a charge-transfer transition, in 
which an electron on one oxygen ligand is excited into a vacant d 
orbital on the Mn ion (Figure 23.36). In essence, an electron is trans-
ferred from a ligand to the metal, so this transition is called a ligand-
to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transition.
An LMCT transition is also responsible for the color of the 
CrO4
2-, which contains the Cr(VI) ion with an [Ar]3d0 electron 
 
conﬁguration.
