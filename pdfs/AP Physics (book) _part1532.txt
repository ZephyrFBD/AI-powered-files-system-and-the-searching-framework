Heat
Calorimetry sometimes involves a change of state, as the following Examples
show. Indeed, latent heats are often measured using calorimetry.
EXERCISE B A pot of water is boiling on a gas stove, and then you turn up the heat.
What happens? (a) The temperature of the water starts increasing. (b) There is a tiny
decrease in the rate of water loss by evaporation. (c) The rate of water loss by evaporation
increases. (d) There is an appreciable increase in both the rate of boiling and the temper-
ature of the water. (e) None of these.
EXERCISE C Which process in Example 14–6 required the greatest heat loss?
Will all the ice melt? At a reception, a 0.50-kg
chunk of ice at 
is placed in 3.0 kg of “iced” tea at 20°C. At what temper-
ature and in what phase will the final mixture be? The tea can be considered as
water. I
