Errors in Meiosis
Nondisjunction occurs when the chromosomes are not separated correctly
during meiosis. This can cause entire chromosomes to be duplicated in a
gamete, which can cause three copies of a chromosome (triploidy) in offspring.
Incorrect numbers of chromosomes often lead to sterility and in plants can
cause increased vigor due to polyploidy.
Bacteria and viruses are common pathogens. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. Viruses require a host to
replicate and sometimes lyse the host cell during infection.
The human microbiome is the collection of all the microbes in and on your
body. We depend on a huge number of microbes to stay alive. Characterizing
and understanding this population is a growing area of research.
Bacteria
Bacteria, common pathogens, are prokaryotes that come in many shapes and sizes. They can infect many things,
and sometimes they cause harm and sometimes they do not. You may have heard of “gut bacteria” before; this is
