Diversifying Selection
Sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection, while
the intermediate phenotypes are, on average, less fit. Known as diversifying selection (Figure 19.9), this is seen in many
populations of animals that have multiple male forms. Large, dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force, while
small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male’s territory. In this case, both the alpha
