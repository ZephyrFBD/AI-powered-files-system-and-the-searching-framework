les produced. 
(C) Adult corals produced 5 times more 
DMSP than juveniles produced. 
(D) Adult corals produced 5 times less DMSP 
than juveniles produced. 
15. In addition to the effect of temperature on 
DMSP produced by corals and their symbionts, 
which of the following relationships is also 
being considered in this experiment? 
(A) Effect of varying light levels and coral 
species 
(B) Effect of additional DMSP produced by 
symbionts and the corals’ age 
(C) Effect of age and varying light levels 
(D) Effect of coral species and additional 
DMSP produced by symbionts 
16. Which of the following best describes the 
scientists’ findings concerning the density of 
symbionts presented in Figure 2 ? 
(A) The symbiont density at 32°C on day 5 
was less than the density on day 0 of the 
experiment. 
(B) The symbiont density at 27°C on day 0 
was less than the density on day 5 of the 
experiment. 
(C) The symbiont density at 32°C was 
different from the density at 27°C on 
days 5 and 10
