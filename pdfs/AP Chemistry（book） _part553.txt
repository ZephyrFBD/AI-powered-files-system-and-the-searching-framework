determine which ions are present.
 
2. Write the chemical formulas of the products by combining the cation from one 
reactant with the anion of the other, using the ionic charges to determine the sub-
scripts in the chemical formulas.
 
3. Check the water solubilities of the products. For a precipitation reaction to occur, 
 
at least one product must be insoluble in water.
 
4. Balance the equation.
