Driving off a cliff. A movie stunt driver on a motorcycle
speeds horizontally off a 50.0-m-high cliff. How fast must the motorcycle leave
the cliff top to land on level ground below, 90.0 m from the base of the cliff where
the cameras are? Ignore air resistance.
APPROACH We explicitly follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy 
on the previous page.
SOLUTION
1. and 2. Read, choose the object, and draw a diagram. Our object is the motor-
cycle and driver, taken as a single unit. The diagram is shown in Fig. 3–22.
3. Choose a coordinate system. We choose the y direction to be positive
upward, with the top of the cliff as
The x direction is horizontal with
at the point where the motorcycle leaves the cliff.
4. Choose a time interval. We choose our time interval to begin
just as
the motorcycle leaves the cliff top at position
Our time
interval ends just before the motorcycle tou
