he hnRNA chain for post-transcriptional processes. Introns
are removed and a 5′ methylguanosine cap and a 3′ poly-A tail are added
to complete the mRNA. The mRNA then exits via the nuclear pores and
goes to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm for translation.
Translation
In a eukaryotic organism, DNA is found in the nucleus of the cell. Protein
synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, so information from the coding
regions of DNA in the nucleus must be moved to the cytoplasm.
Information is moved to the cytoplasm through mRNA (messenger RNA).
Once in the cytoplasm, mRNA acts as the template for protein
translation. A short series of three bases, called a triplet or codon, codes
for a tRNA (transfer RNA) that carries a specific amino acid. There are 64
(43) possible triplets, but there are only 20 amino acids. Even allowing for
the start signal codon AUG as a site to begin protein translation and
several codons acting as stop signals, there is considerable redundancy
(also known as degeneracy
