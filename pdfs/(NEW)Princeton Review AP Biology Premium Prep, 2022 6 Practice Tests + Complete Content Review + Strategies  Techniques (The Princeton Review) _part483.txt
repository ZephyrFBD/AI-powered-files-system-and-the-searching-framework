 is probably not a fluke (i.e., 40 rolled sixes) and the null hypothesis outcome must not correctly
describe what is occurring. In the dice case, rolling a six 40 times would cause the null hypothesis of expecting a
1:1:1:1:1:1 to be rejected and the die can be considered to be weighted. In the calculations, expected results if the
null hypothesis were true are compared to the actual values, and an χ2 value is calculated. This value is compared to
a critical value, and a decision is made to reject or accept the null hypothesis.
For example, suppose data was collected from 100 families with three children each. Fourteen families had three
female children, 36 families had two females and a male, 30 families had one female and two males, and 20 families
had three male children. We would expect offspring sex to segregate independently. In other words, the sex of a
given child shouldn’t be affected by the sex of previous children. Let’s test whether this is true for this dataset.
Since we e
