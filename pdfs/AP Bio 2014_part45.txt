The food web above represents feeding relationships in a biological community near a deep-sea hydrothermal 
vent. Hydrothermal vents are geysers on the seafloor that gush super-heated, mineral-rich water. The seawater 
surrounding hydrothermal vents typically contains carbon dioxide (CO2), molecular hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide 
(H2S), and methane (CH4). Sunlight, however, fails to reach the seafloor where deep-sea hydrothermal vents are 
located. 
 
As part of an investigation, researchers collected living specimens from an area near a deep-sea hydrothermal 
vent. Mussels in the collection were found to be dependent on mo
