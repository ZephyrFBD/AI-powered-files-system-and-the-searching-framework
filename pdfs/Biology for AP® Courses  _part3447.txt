Movement in a hydrostatic skeleton is provided by muscles that surround the coelom. The muscles in a hydrostatic skeleton
contract to change the shape of the coelom; the pressure of the fluid in the coelom produces movement. For example,
earthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal muscle of the body wall hydrostatic skeleton, called
peristalsis, which alternately shorten and lengthen the body. Lengthening the body extends the anterior end of the organism.
Most organisms have a mechanism to fix themselves in the substrate. Shortening the muscles then draws the posterior
portion of the body forward. Although a hydrostatic skeleton is well-suited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms
