DNA replication in eukaryotes. Be sure to also review
Figures 9.1 and 9.4.
Replication begins at special sites called origins of replication,
where the two strands of DNA separate to form replication
bubbles. Thousands of these bubbles can be seen along the DNA
molecule by using electron microscopy. Replication bubbles speed
up the process of replication along the giant DNA molecule that
consists of 6 billion nucleotides. A replication bubble expands as
replication proceeds in both directions at once.
At each end of the replication bubble is a replication fork, a Y-

shaped region where the new strands of DNA are elongating.
Eventually, all the replication bubbles fuse.
The enzyme DNA polymerase catalyzes the antiparallel elongation
of the new DNA strands. (At least 15 different types of DNA
polymerase have been identified, but only one is involved in the
elongation of the DNA strand.)
DNA polymerase builds a new strand from t
