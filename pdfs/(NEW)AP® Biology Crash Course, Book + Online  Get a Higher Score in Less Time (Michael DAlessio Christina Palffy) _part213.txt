ato core is isotonic to the sucrose concentration. A net change of 0% at x = 0.36 M is the
concentration that the water potential in the potato tissue is equal to the sucrose concentration
(isotonic).
Calculation of Water Potential
If the calculated water potential is less than the water potential surrounding the bag, then water will
flow into the bag (more solutes/molecules inside the bag). If the calculated water potential is greater
than the water potential surrounding the bag, water will flow out of the bag (less solute molecules
inside the bag). Thus, water will flow from high to low water potential.
Exercise 4E:
 Plant Cell Plasmolysis
Interpretation of this Exercise
Plant cells that are in a hypotonic solution will cause water to diffuse into the cell, thus creating a
turgid cell.
Plant cells that are in a hypertonic solution will cause water to diffuse out of the cell, thus creating a
plasmolyzed cell.
Plant cells that are in an isotonic solution will cause water to equally dif
