nimals can reproduce without
some form of sexual reproduction. Plants also live dual lives in that they
have specific structures for reproduction (flowers, pollen, and fruit), while
the rest of the plant continues life as usual. In contrast, female animals’
entire bodies are aﬀected by the reproductive process, so reproduction
has to be an entire stage of existence for them. In fact, some animals’
adult life stage is solely for the purpose of reproduction; they don’t even
have mouthparts for the ingestion of nutrients. Because of the
specialization of certain plant structures, however, plants need not
undergo such vast changes to reproduce.
AP EXPERT NOTE
You do not need to know the details of the sexual reproduction
cycles in diﬀerent plants and animals. Focus instead on the
similarities among the processes and how this is important for
genetic variation.
Plants can reproduce vegetatively as a function of their indeterminate
growth. Plant cells can diﬀerentiate when isolated from the
