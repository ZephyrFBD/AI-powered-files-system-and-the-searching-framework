s of multiple antenna proteins that
contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. The absorption of
a single photon or distinct quantity or “packet” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited
state. In short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. The
energy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to
the reaction center. Up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons.

Figure 8.16 In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, energy from sunlight is used to extract electrons from
water. The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (PSI), which reduces
NADP+ to NADPH. The electron transport chain moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lum
