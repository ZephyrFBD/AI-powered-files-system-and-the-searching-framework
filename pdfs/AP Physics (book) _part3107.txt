Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom
90. (a) Suppose an unknown element has an absorption spec-
trum with lines corresponding to 2.5, 4.7, and 5.1 eV above
its ground state and an ionization energy of 11.5 eV. Draw
an energy level diagram for this element. (b) If a 5.1-eV
photon is absorbed by an atom of this substance, in which
state was the atom before absorbing the photon? What will
be the energies of the photons that can subsequently be
emitted by this atom?
91. A photon of momentum 
is emitted
from a hydrogen atom. To what spectrum series does this
photon belong, and from what energy level was it ejected?
92. Light of wavelength 464 nm falls on a metal which has a
work function of 2.28 eV. (a) How much voltage should be
applied to bring the current to zero? (b) What is the
maximum speed
