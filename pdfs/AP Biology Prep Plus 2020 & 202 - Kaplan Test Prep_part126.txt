kely to
represent their results correctly?
Graph A, because the membrane is impermeable to small,
hydrophobic molecules; oxygen uses active transport to flow
against its concentration gradient
(A)
Graph A, because the membrane is permeable to small,
hydrophobic molecules; oxygen diﬀuses through the
membrane down its concentration gradient
(B)
Graph B, because the membrane is impermeable to small,
charged molecules; oxygen binds to a carrier that allows it to
flow down its concentration gradient
(C)
Graph B, because the membrane is permeable to all gas
molecules; oxygen flows by osmosis down its concentration
gradient
(D)
5. In an experiment to study diﬀusion across a semi-permeable
membrane, students fill a length of dialysis tubing with a solution
of 0.9% NaCl. The filled dialysis tube is soaked in a beaker
containing 5% albumin (MW 64,500) in distilled water.
The students tested the content of the dialysis tube and the
beaker before soaking the dialysis tube in the beaker. Aȇer letti
