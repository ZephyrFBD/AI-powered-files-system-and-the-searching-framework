molecule of glucose from six molecules of CO2. This process is analogous to eating
breakfast in the morning to acquire energy for your body that can be used later in the day. Under ideal conditions, energy
from 18 molecules of ATP is required to synthesize one molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis. Glucose
molecules can also be combined with and converted into other types of sugars. When sugars are consumed, molecules of
glucose eventually make their way into each living cell of the organism. Inside the cell, each sugar molecule is broken down
through a complex series of chemical reactions. The goal of these reactions is to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar
molecules. The harvested energy is used to make high-energy ATP molecules, which can be used to perform work, powering
many chemical reactions in the cell. The amount of energy needed to make one molecule of glucose from six molecules of
carbon dioxide is 18 molecules of ATP and 12 molecules of NADPH (e
