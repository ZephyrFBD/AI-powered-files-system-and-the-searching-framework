terotrophic organisms harvest free 
energy from carbon compounds produced by other organisms. The process of cellular 
respiration harvests the energy in carbon compounds to produce ATP that powers most 
of the vital cellular processes. In eukaryotes, respiration occurs in the mitochondria 
within cells. 
If sufficient oxygen is available, glucose may be oxidized completely in a series of 
enzyme-mediated steps, as summarized by the following reaction:
C6H12O6 + 6O2(g) → 6CO2(g) + 6H2O + energy
More specifically,
C6H12O6 + 6O2→ 6CO2 + 6H2O + 686 kilocalories of energy
mole of glucose oxidized
The chemical oxidation of glucose has important implications to the measurement of 
respiration. From the equation, if glucose is the energy source, then for every molecule 
of oxygen consumed, one molecule of carbon dioxide is produced. 
Suppose you wanted to measure the overall rate of cellular respiration.
