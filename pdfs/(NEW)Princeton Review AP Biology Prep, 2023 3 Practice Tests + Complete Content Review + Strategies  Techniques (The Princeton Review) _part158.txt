Digest This Tidbit!
Did you ever look at a pile of firewood and think, Yummy!? Probably not. Wood
is almost entirely made of cellulose, which contains β-linked glucose that
humans can’t digest. When we eat plants, we can get nutrients from their
stored starch, but not from the cellulose of their cell walls. This passes through
us as fiber roughage. Fiber is important in the diet for other reasons, but you
should probably leave the firewood alone.
To illustrate the concept of polysaccharide branching, take a look below at two components of starch: amylose and
amylopectin. Amylose is an unbranched polysaccharide and is thus linear, whereas amylopectin has many branched
chains of glucose monomers.
Proteins
Proteins perform most of the work in your cells, and are important for structure, function, and regulation of your
tissues and organs. There are thousands of different types of proteins. Amino acids are organic molecules that serve
as the building blocks of proteins. They contain car
