in a reverse direction. This
is known as inversion.
Translocation is a common alteration in which the piece of DNA that
breaks oﬀ a chromosome attaches to the end of another chromosome,
most commonly not the homologous chromosome. In some cases, there
is a reciprocal translocation, in which the chromosome giving a piece of
DNA also receives a comparably-sized piece of DNA from the
chromosome it donated to.
In many cases, these alterations in structure render large groups of genes
useless, especially because most genes need neighboring regulatory
sequences to work properly. Aȇer certain alterations, genes may be far
enough away from their regulatory elements that they cannot be
transcribed.
Mendelian Inheritance
Aȇer learning the basics of genetics, it is important to review some
specific information about inheritance that might appear on the exam.
You need to be familiar with mathematical principles of simple
probability. Relax; it’s not as hard as it sounds. Even if there are more
