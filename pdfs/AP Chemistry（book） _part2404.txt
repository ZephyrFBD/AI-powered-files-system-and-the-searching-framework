Sample Exercise 15.6
 Analyzing a Heterogeneous Equilibrium
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked which of several combinations of species can 
establish an equilibrium between calcium carbonate and its de-
composition products, calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.
Plan For equilibrium to be achieved, it must be possible for both 
the forward process and the reverse process to occur. For the for-
ward process to occur, some calcium carbonate must be present. 
For the reverse process to occur, both calcium oxide and carbon 
dioxide must be present. In both cases, either the necessary com-
pounds may be present initially or they may be formed by reac-
tion of the other species.
Solve Equilibrium can be reached in all cases except (c)
