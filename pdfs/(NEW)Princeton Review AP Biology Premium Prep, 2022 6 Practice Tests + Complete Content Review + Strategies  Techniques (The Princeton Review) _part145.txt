the hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge. Molecules that
have partially positive and partially negative charges are said to be polar. Water is therefore a polar molecule. The
positively charged elements of the water molecules strongly attract the negatively charged ends of other polar
compounds (including water). Likewise, the negatively charged ends strongly attract the positively charged ends of
polar compounds. These forces are most readily apparent in the tendency of water molecules to stick together, as in
the formation of water beads or raindrops.
These types of intermolecular attractions are called hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are weak chemical bonds that
form when a hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to one electronegative atom is also attracted to another
electronegative atom. Water molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds.
Although hydrogen bonds are individually weak, they are strong when present i
