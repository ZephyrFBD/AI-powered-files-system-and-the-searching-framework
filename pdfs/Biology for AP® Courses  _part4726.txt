es description, which according to the State of Observed
Species Report is 17,000 to 20,000 new species per year, it will take close to 500 years to finish describing life on this
planet.
[4] Over time, the task becomes both increasingly impossible and increasingly easier as extinction removes species
from the planet.
Naming and counting species may seem an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but it is not simply an
accounting. Describing species is a complex process by which biologists determine an organismâ€™s unique characteristics and
whether or not that organism belongs to any other described species. It allows biologists to find and recognize the species
after the initial discovery, and allows them to follow up on questions about its biology. In addition, the unique characteristics
of each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species on which humans depend. Understanding these
characteristics is the value of finding and naming species.
