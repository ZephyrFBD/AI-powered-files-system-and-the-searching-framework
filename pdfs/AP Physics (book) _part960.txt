Stress and Strain
From Eq. 9–4, we see that the change in length of an object is directly propor-
tional to the product of the object’s length 
and the force per unit area 
applied to it. It is general practice to define the force per unit area as the stress:
which has SI units of 
Also, the strain is defined to be the ratio of the change
in length to the original length:
and is dimensionless (no units). Strain is thus the fractional change in length of the
object, and is a measure of how much the object has been deformed. Stress is applied
to the material by external agents, whereas strain is the material’s response to the
stress. Equation 9–4 can be rewritten as
(9;5)
or
Thus we see that the strain is directly proportional to the stress, in the linear
(elastic) region of Fig. 9–19.
Tension, Compression, and Shear Stress
The rod shown in Fig. 9–20a is said to be under tension or tensile str
