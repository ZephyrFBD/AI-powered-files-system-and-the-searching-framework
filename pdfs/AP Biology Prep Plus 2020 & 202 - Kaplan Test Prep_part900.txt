17. Nondisjunction, the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister
chromatids to separate, results in aneuploidy (an irregular number of
chromosomes in a cell). The figure shows the result of one form of
nondisjunction.
Based on the figure, which of the following conclusions would be most
justified?
Two homologous chromosomes failed to separate in interphase.
(A)
Sister chromatids failed to separate in mitosis during anaphase.
(B)
Two homologous chromosomes moved to the same pole in meiosis
I.
(C)
Sister chromatids moved to the same pole in meiosis II.
