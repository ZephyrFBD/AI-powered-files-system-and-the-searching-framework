ular chemical reactions into energy
within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells
need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella,
contracting muscle fibers to create movement, and reproduction.
Figure 6.11 Shown are two examples of energy being transferred from one system to another and transformed from
one form to another. Humans can convert the chemical energy in food, like this ice cream cone, into kinetic energy
(the energy of movement to ride a bicycle). Plants can convert electromagnetic radiation (light energy) from the sun
into chemical energy. (credit “ice cream”: modification of work by D. Sharon Pruitt; credit “kids on bikes”: modification
