o the heart. It is less
controlled and structured than an open
circulatory system, but nutrients and waste
products are transported more efficiently.
b.
Blood in closed circulatory system is not
enclosed in blood vessels, but is pumped into a
hemocoel, which circulates around the organs,
then reenters the heart through ostia. It is more
structured, controlled, and nutrients and waste
products are transported more efficiently.

d.
Blood in a closed circulatory system is present
inside blood vessels, circulates unidirectional
from heart around the systemic circulatory route,
and then returns to the heart. It is more
