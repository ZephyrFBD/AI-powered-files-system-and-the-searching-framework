at the moment an aircraft is breaking through the sound barrier.
Actually, a shock wave follows the aircraft at all times it is traveling at supersonic
speeds. A series of observers on the ground will each hear a loud “boom” as the
shock wave passes, Fig. 12–25. The shock wave consists of a cone whose apex is at
the aircraft. The angle of this cone,
(see Fig. 12–23d), is given by
(12;5)
where 
is the velocity of the object (the aircraft) and 
is the velocity of
sound in the medium (air for an airplane).

Sonar
The reflection of sound is used in many applications to determine distance. The
sonar† or pulse-echo technique is used to locate underwater objects. A transmitter
sends out a sound pulse through the water, and a detector receives its reflection,
or echo, a short time later. This time interval is carefully measured, and from it
the distance to the reflecting object can be determined since the speed of sound
in water is known
