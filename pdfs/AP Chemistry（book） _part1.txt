The halide perovskites, exempliﬁed by methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), whose structure is shown on the front cover, have 
emerged in recent years as alternatives to conventional semiconductors like silicon, gallium arsenide, and cadmium selenide. These 
materials show tremendous potential for use in devices such as light-emitting diodes and radiation detectors, but no application has 
generated more excitement than their performance in solar cells. Scientists have been able to prepare halide perovskite-based solar 
cells that convert sunlight to electricity with 20% efﬁciency, a ﬁgure comparable to the best silicon solar cells on the market. While 
the high efﬁciencies are impressive, the truly revolutionary breakthrough is that halide perovskite solar cells can be made from solution 
using inexpensive, readily
