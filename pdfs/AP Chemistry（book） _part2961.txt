ocarbons? (b) Why are hydrofluorocarbons 
potentially less harmful to the ozone layer than CFCs?
 18.26  Draw the Lewis structure for the chlorofluorocarbon 
 
CFC-11, CFCl3. What chemical characteristics of this sub-
stance allow it to effectively deplete stratospheric ozone?
 18.27  The average bond enthalpies of the C ¬ F and C ¬ Cl bonds 
are 485 kJ/mol and 328 kJ/mol, respectively. (a) What is 
the maximum wavelength that a photon can possess and 
still have sufficient energy to break the C ¬ F and C ¬ Cl 
bonds, respectively? (b) Given the fact that O2, N2, and 
O in the upper atmosphere absorb most of the light with 
wavelengths shorter than 240 nm, would you expect the 
photodissociation of C ¬ F bonds to be significant in the 
lower atmosphere?
 18.28  (a) When chlorine atoms react with atmospheric ozone, 
what are the products of the reaction? (b) Based on aver-
age bond enthalpies, would you expect a photon capable of 
dissociating a C ¬ Cl bond to have sufficient energy to
