Connection for AP® Courses
Much of the information in this section is not within the scope for AP®. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are
proteins produced and secreted by plasma cells (differentiated B lymphocytes) that mediate the humoral immune response.
Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins consisting of four polypeptides with at least two binding sites for a specific antigen. The
areas where the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains. For AP®, you do not need to know the different
classes of antibodies or the molecular structure of a specific antibody. What is important to understand is that antibodies are
antigen-specific. When antibodies bind antigens, they can neutralize pathogens, mark them
