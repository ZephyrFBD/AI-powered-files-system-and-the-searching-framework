, representing diï¬€erent antigens on the red blood cell
membrane. Individuals with type A blood have an A antigen and
individuals with type B blood have a B antigen. Individuals with
type O blood do not have either of these antigens on the surface
of their red blood cells. What most likely happens in individuals
with type AB blood?
Individuals with AB blood have a unique antigen that
combines features of the A and B antigens within a single
molecule, resulting in AB antigens that are present on the
surface of their blood cells.
(A)
Individuals with AB blood have some cells that have A
antigens on them and other cells that have B antigens on
them.
(B)
Individuals with the AB blood type have a gene that codes for
the A antigen and another gene that codes for the B antigen,
but it is unpredictable which antigens will appear on the
surface of their blood cells.
(C)
Individuals with AB blood have one gene that codes for the A
antigen and another gene that codes for the B antigen, so
both ant
