Summary

What causes the action potential to travel along the axon? The action potential
occurs at the point of stimulation, as shown in Fig.18–31a. The membrane momen-
tarily is positive on the inside and negative on the outside at this point. Nearby
charges are attracted toward this region, as shown in Fig. 18–31b. The potential
in these adjacent regions then drops, causing an action potential there. Thus, as
the membrane returns to normal at the original point, nearby it experiences a
