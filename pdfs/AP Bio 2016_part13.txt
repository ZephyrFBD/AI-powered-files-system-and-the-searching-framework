The total Section II time is 1 hour and 30 minutes. This includes a 10-minute 
reading period. The reading period is designed to provide you with time to 
develop thoughtful, well-organized responses. You are advised to spend the 
10-minute period reading all the questions, and to use the unlined pages 
to sketch graphs, make notes, and plan your answers. The focus of the 
reading period should be the organization of questions 1 and 2. You may 
begin writing your exam responses before the reading period is over. You 
may make notes on the pages that contain the exam questions, but your 
responses must be written on the designated lined pages using a pen with 
black or dark blue ink. Are there any questions? . . .
