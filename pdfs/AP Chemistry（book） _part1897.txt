Calculating the Density of an Ionic Solid
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan
(a) We need to count the number of anions in the unit cell of 
the sodium chloride structure, remembering that ions on 
the corners, edges, and faces of the unit cell are only partially 
inside the unit cell.
(b) We can apply the same approach to determine the number of 
cations in the unit cell. We can double-check our answer by 
writing the empirical formula to make sure the charges of the 
cations and anions are balanced.
(c)  Because density is an intensive property, the density of the unit 
cell is the same as the density of a bulk crystal. To calculate the 
density we must divide the mass of the atoms per unit cell by 
the volume of the unit cell. To determine the volume of the unit 
cell, we need to estimate the length of the unit cell edge by Ô¨Årst 
identifying the direction along which the ions touch and then 
using ionic radii to estimate the length. Once we have the length 
of the unit
