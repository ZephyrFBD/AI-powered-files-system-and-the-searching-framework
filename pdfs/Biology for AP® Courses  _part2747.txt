er vapor is lost to the external environment,
decreasing the rate of transpiration.
c.
Water vapor enters the spaces in the mesophyll,
increasing the rate of transpiration.
d.
The rate of photosynthesis drops when stomata
open.
47. A pulse of sugars labelled with a fluorescent dye is
supplied to leaves of young plants. After a brief interval,
tissue sections are obtained from the plant and examined
under the fluorescence microscope. Tissues are scored for
the presence of fluorescence and ranked from very high to
low fluorescence. Which cells would contain the most
fluorescence?
a.
xylem
b.
companion cells
c.
sieve elements
d.
epidermis
48. Sugars produced in the leaf are distributed throughout
the plant body. An experimenter supplies plants with a

pulse of radiolabeled CO2 in a control chamber. The
movement of radioactively labeled sugar is monitored in
the plant by analyzing different cells content over time.
Where will the radiolabeled sugar
