generations.
• There are no unaffected carriers of the allele.
• Each affected individual must have one or
more affected parent.
(b) Calculate the minimum number of nucleotides required in the coding region of the LDS2B mRNA 
molecule to produce and terminate the 565-amino acid polypeptide. Provide TWO reasons that 
the number of nucleotides in the mature mRNA may differ from the number of base pairs in the 
gene. (4 points maximum; LO 3.1, 3.4, 4.5) 
Result of Calculation (2 points) 
NOTE: Points are earned in one column only. 
1695 (1 point) 
1698 (2 points)

Scoring Rationale 
• Response demonstrates
understanding of triplet code
in production of polypeptide.
(565 amino acids ×
3 nucleotides = 1695)
• Response demonstrates
understanding of triplet
code in production of
polypeptide.
• Response demonstrates
understanding of the role of
the stop codon in
terminating translation.
(1695 + 3 = 1698)
• Response demonstrates
