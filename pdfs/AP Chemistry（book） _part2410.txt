What is the value of the equilibrium constant Kc if once the system comes to equilibrium at 448 °C the concentration of HI is 
1.87 * 10 - 3 M?

(1) We tabulate the initial and equilibrium 
concentrations of as many species as we 
can. We also provide space in our table for 
listing the changes in concentrations. As 
shown, it is convenient to use the chemi-
cal equation as the heading for the table.
Analyze We are given the initial concentrations of H2 and I2 and 
the equilibrium concentration of HI. We are asked to calculate the 
equilibrium constant Kc for H21g2 + I21g2 ∆2 HI1g2.
Plan We construct a table to find equilibrium concentrations of all 
species and then use the equilibrium concentrations to calculate 
the equilibrium constant.
Comment The same method can be applied to gaseous equilibrium 
problems
