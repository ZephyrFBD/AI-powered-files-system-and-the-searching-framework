This website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/relationships) has several examples to show how appearances can be
misleading in understanding the phylogenetic relationships of organisms.
James Lake of the UCLA/NASA Astrobiology Institute presented new evidence regarding the evolution of eukaryotic
cells. He hypothesized that eukaryotes developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between the two other domains
of life. What kind of genetic evidence would best support this hypothesis?
a.
Their mitochondrial DNA resembles that of other eukaryotes.
b.
The chloroplasts of eukaryotes contain a double cell layer.
c.
All eukaryotic genes are identical to either Archaea or Bacteria.
d.
Some eukaryotic genes resemble those of Archaea, while some resemble those of Bacteria and some are
unlike the genes of either domain.
