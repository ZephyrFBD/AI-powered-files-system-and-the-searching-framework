kJ2 that can be used to 
drive other reactions.
In the human body, the metabolism of glucose occurs via a 
complex series of reactions, most of which release free energy. The 
free energy released during these steps is used in part to reconvert 
lower-energy ADP back to higher-energy ATP
. Thus, the ATPâ€“ADP 
interconversions are used to store energy during metabolism and 
to release it as needed to drive nonspontaneous reactions in the 
body. If you take a course in general biology or biochemistry, you 
will have the opportunity to learn more about the remarkable 
sequence of reactions used to transport free energy throughout 
the human body.
