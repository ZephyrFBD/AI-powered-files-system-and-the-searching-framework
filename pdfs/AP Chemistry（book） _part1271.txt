How to Draw Lewis Structures
 
1. Sum the valence electrons from all atoms, taking into account overall 
charge. Use the periodic table to help you determine the number of valence elec-
trons in each atom. For an anion, add one electron to the total for each negative 
charge. For a cation, subtract one electron from the total for each positive charge. 
Do not worry about keeping track of which electrons come from which atoms. 
Only the total number is important.
 
2. Write the symbols for the atoms, show which atoms are attached to 
which, and connect them with a single bond (a line, representing two 
electrons). Chemical formulas are often written in the order in which the atoms are 
connected in the molecule or ion. The formula HCN, for example, tells you that the 
carbon atom is bonded to the H and to the N. In many polyatomic molecules and 
ions, the central atom is usually written first, as in CO3
2 - and SF4. Remember
