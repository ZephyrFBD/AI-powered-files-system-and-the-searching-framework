Diversity in an Ecosystem
Species diversity, the variety of kinds of organisms that make up a
community, has two components. One is species richness, the number of
different species in the community. The other is relative abundance, the
proportion of different species within a community. Communities with

(organisms that become established outside their native range). They are
also more able to recover from environmental stresses, such as drought or
