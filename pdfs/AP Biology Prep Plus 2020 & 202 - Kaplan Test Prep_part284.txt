colonization at low
phosphate levels. (C) is incorrect because there is a clear pattern:
mycorrhizae colonization increases as environmental phosphate levels
decrease. (D) is incorrect because it provides a less plausible
explanation of the results. There is no reason to suppose that higher
levels of phosphate inhibit mycorrhizal growth, but there is reason to
expect that petunias would be less accommodating to the mycorrhizae
when they have an adequate supply of phosphate.

Learning Objective: 7.2
Xylem is dead tissue that transports water in plants. Because it already
contains pores, it can be used as a filter if water is pushed through it.
Therefore, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because periderm, also known
as bark, would have to be hollowed out to form a straw-like structure,
and even then it would not contain pores useful for filtering. (C) is
incorrect because phloem is living vascular tissue, not dead. (D) is
incorrect because the cortex is not used to transport water, s
