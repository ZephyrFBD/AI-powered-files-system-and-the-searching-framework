01 °C,
P = 0.006 atm2 falls within a range of temperatures and 
pressures found on Earth. Saturn’s largest moon Titan 
has a considerable amount of methane in its atmosphere. 
The conditions on the surface of Titan are estimated to be 
P = 1.6 atm and T = -178 °C. As seen from the phase dia-
gram of methane (Figure 11.30), these conditions are not 
far from the triple point of methane, raising the tantalizing 
possibility that solid, liquid, and gaseous methane can be 
found on Titan. (a) In what state would you expect to ﬁnd 
methane on the surface of Titan? (b) On moving upward 
through the atmosphere, the pressure will decrease. If we 
assume that the temperature does not change, what phase 
change would you expect to see as we move away from the 
surface?
 11.64  At 25 °C gallium is a solid with a density of 5.91 g>cm3. Its 
melting point, 29.8 °C, is low enough that you can melt it 
by holding it in your hand. The density of liquid gallium 
just above the melting point is 6.1 g>cm
