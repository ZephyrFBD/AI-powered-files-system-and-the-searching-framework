he same strand of DNA. A repair enzyme,
photolyase, which is activated by visible light, is present in
plants and most animals, but not in humans. In
characterizing the relationship between environmental
mutagens and cell damage, a useful assumption is often
made and referred to as the linear hypothesis. This
assumption states that the extent of damage is proportional
to the amount of radiation received.
Mutation rates for a strain (preac) that does not produce
photolyase and a wild-type (+) strain were studied.
Cultures of the two strains of yeast were diluted, and
nutrient-containing plates were inoculated in triplicate at
23 °C. The plates were exposed to bright sunlight for
varying time intervals. After exposure, the plates were
incubated in the dark at 23 °C. After incubation between 1
and 8 hours, data shown in the table below were collected
by counting the density of living cells relative to the
control, and averaging these among replicates.
B. Using the data table below, graph
