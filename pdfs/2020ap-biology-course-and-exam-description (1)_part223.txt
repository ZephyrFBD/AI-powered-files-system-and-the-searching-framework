s. Connections 
to ecology throughout the course are 
fundamental and will help students to build 
this skill.
Developing Understanding
As a culmination of this course, Unit 8 brings together all other units to show how a 
system’s interactions are directly related to the system’s available energy and its ability to 
evolve and respond to changes in its environment. When highly complex living systems 
interact, communities and ecosystems will change based on those interactions. The more 
biodiversity present in a system, the more likely that system is to maintain its health and 
success in the face of disruption. Energy flows through systems; the rate of flow determines 
the success of the species within the systems. By this point in the curriculum, a student 
should be able to accurately determine what happens within biological systems when 
disruptions occur.
