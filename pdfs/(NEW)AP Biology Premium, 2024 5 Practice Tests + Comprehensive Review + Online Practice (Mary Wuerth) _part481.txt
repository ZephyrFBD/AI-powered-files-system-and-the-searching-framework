11. A scientist is studying the allele frequencies in a population over several generations to help determine if the
population is undergoing evolution. The data are shown in the table.

(a) Describe why looking at allele frequencies over several generations could be used to determine if a
population is undergoing evolution.
(b) Describe the changes in alleles A1 and A2 from generation 1 to generation 4.
(c) Evaluate the scientistâ€™s hypothesis that this population is undergoing evolution based on the data available.
(d) Explain how the data would differ if individuals with the genotype A1A2 were more likely to survive than
individuals with the genotype A1A1 or individuals with the genotype A2A2.
