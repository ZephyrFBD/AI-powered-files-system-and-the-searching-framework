n the oxidation state of one or more elements. In 
every oxidation–reduction reaction one substance is oxidized (its 
oxidation state, or number, increases) and one substance is reduced 
(its oxidation state, or number, decreases). The substance that is oxi-
dized is referred to as a reducing agent, or reductant, because it causes 
the reduction of some other substance. Similarly, the substance that 
is reduced is referred to as an oxidizing agent, or oxidant, because it 
causes the oxidation of some other substance.
BALANCING REDOX EQUATIONS (SECTION 20.2) An oxidization–
reduction reaction can be balanced by dividing the reaction into 
two half-reactions, one for oxidation and one for reduction. A half- 
reaction is a balanced chemical equation that includes electrons. In 
oxidation half-reactions, the electrons are on the product (right) side 
of the equation. In reduction half-reactions, the electrons are on the 
reactant (left) side of the equation. Each half-reaction is balanced
