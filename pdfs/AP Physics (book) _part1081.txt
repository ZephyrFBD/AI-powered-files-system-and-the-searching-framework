energy due to compression and to thermal energy by friction can be taken into
account by adding terms to Eq. 10–5. These terms are difficult to calculate
theoretically and are normally determined empirically for given situations. They
do not significantly alter the explanations for the phenomena described above.

1 Viscosity
Real fluids have a certain amount of internal friction called viscosity, as men-
tioned in Section 10–8. Viscosity exists in both liquids and gases, and is essentially
a frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid as the layers move past one
another. In liquids, viscosity is due to the electrical cohesive forces between the
molecules. In gases, it arises from collisions between the molecules.
The viscosity of different fluids can be expressed quantitatively by a coeffi-
cient of viscosity,
(the Greek lowercase letter eta), which is defined in the
following way. A thin layer of fluid is placed between two flat plates. One plate 
is stationary and the o
