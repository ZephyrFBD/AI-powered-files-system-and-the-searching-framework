). A high Cq value 
for a sample indicates the gene was expressed at a low level.  
To analyze whether any of the examined variables affected expression of the housekeeping genes, 
researchers examined the range of Cq values for each gene in response to each variable. Genes with a wide 
range of Cq values were determined to be affected by the variable, while genes with a narrow range of Cq 
values were determined to be unaffected by the variable.

(a) 
Based on the data in Figure 1, identify the gene that had the lowest median Cq value 
when bees of different developmental stages were compared. 
• 
RPS5 
1 point 
(b) 
 The Cq value is inversely proportional to the amount of mRNA from that gene in the 
starting sample. Based on the data in Figure 1, identify the gene that has the lowest level 
of gene expression
