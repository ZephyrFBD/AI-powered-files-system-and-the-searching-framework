29. Based on the data in Table I, which of the 
following best explains why there are no 
individuals with constricted pods in the 
F1 generation? 
(A) Inflated pod shape is dominant to 
constricted pod shape. 
(B) The inflated-pod offspring in the 
F1 generation are homozygous. 
(C) Constricted pod shape typically arises 
from a new mutation in the F1 generation. 
(D) The constricted-pod offspring are carriers 
for the inflated pod shape allele. 
 
30. In Table I, the ratio of phenotypes in the offspring 
from the testcross with F1 plants that had purple 
flowers and inflated pods suggests that the genes 
for flower color and pod shape are located 
(A) close together on the same autosome 
(B) on the X chromosome 
(C) on different chromosomes 
(D) on a mitochondrial chromosome 
 
31. Which of the following provides the best 
justification for an assumption that might have 
been used in the computer simulation (Table II) ? 
(A) The broad allele is recessive to the narrow
