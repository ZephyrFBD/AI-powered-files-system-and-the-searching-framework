ins, and puffins consume Arctic grass.
(a) Identify the trophic levels to which the Arctic fox, puffin, and Arctic grass belong.
(b) Explain why the number of Arctic foxes on this island will most likely be less than the number of puffins
in a healthy ecosystem.
(c) Predict the effect that the elimination of all Arctic foxes on this island would have on the puffins and
Arctic grass.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).

13. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) eat dace fish (Leuciscus leuciscus). Dace fish eat daphnia. Daphnia
eat algae in the lake. The number of largemouth bass and dace fish in a lake are recorded over a 10-year period.
At year 5, great blue herons (Ardea Herodias) are introduced to the lake. Great blue herons feed on young
largemouth bass. The following graph shows the data regarding the relative population sizes of the largemouth
bass and dace fish over the 10-year period.
(a) Describe the trophic level of the dace fish in this ecosystem.
