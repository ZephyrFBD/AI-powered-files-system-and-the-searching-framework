 interphase.
Interphase is divided into G1, S, and G2 phases. The mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of
five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The final stage of the mitotic phase is
cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal
cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).
10.3 Control of the Cell Cycle
Each step of the cell cycle is monitored by internal controls called checkpoints. There are three major checkpoints in the
cell cycle: one near the end of G1, a second at the G2/M transition, and the third during metaphase. Positive regulator
molecules allow the cell cycle to advance to the next stage. Negative regulator molecules monitor cellular conditions and
can halt the cycle until specific requirements are met.
10.4 Cancer and the Cell Cycle
Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulat
