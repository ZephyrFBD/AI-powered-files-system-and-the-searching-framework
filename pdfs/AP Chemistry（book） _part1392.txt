Predicting Bond Angles
Eyedrops for dry eyes usually contain a water-soluble polymer called poly(vinyl alcohol), which is based on the unstable organic 
molecule vinyl alcohol:

Predict the approximate values for the H ¬ O¬ C and O¬ C¬ C bond angles in vinyl alcohol.
 
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a Lewis structure and asked to determine two 
bond angles.
Plan To predict a bond angle, we determine
