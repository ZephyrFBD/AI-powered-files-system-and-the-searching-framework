(Part c) 1 point for a correct explanation of the increase in transpiration rate from  
0 to 60 percent of open stomata: 
• 
From 0 to 60 percent open stomata, there is an increase in gas exchange 
with more stomata open. 
• 
There is higher rate of diffusion between the leaf interior and the 
environment with more stomata open. 
1 point for a correct explanation of the flattening of the curve when more than  
60 percent of stomata are open: 
• 
When more than 60 percent of the stomata are open, another factor 
becomes limiting.
• 
Rate of water movement is now limiting. 
• 
Transpiration is now limited by humidity.
(Part d) Up to 3 points for a reasonable description of each environment,
