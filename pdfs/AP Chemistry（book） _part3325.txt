20.97  A disproportionation reaction is an oxidation–reduction 
reaction in which the same substance is oxidized and 
reduced. Complete and balance the following dispropor-
tionation reactions:
(a) Ni+1aq2 ¡ Ni2+1aq2 + Ni1s2 (acidic solution)
(b) MnO4
2-1aq2 ¡ MnO4
-1aq2 + MnO21s2 (acidic  
solution)
(c) H2SO31aq2 ¡ S1s2 + HSO4
-1aq2 (acidic solution)
(d) Cl21aq2 ¡ Cl-1aq2 + ClO-1aq2 (basic solution)
 
20.98  A common shorthand way to represent a voltaic cell is
anode& anode solution& & cathode solution&cathode
A double vertical line represents a salt bridge or a porous 
barrier. A single vertical line represents a change in phase, 
such as from solid to solution. (a) Write the half-reactions 
and overall cell reaction represented by Fe& Fe2+ & & Ag+ &Ag; 
calculate the standard cell emf using data in Appendix E. 
(b) Write the h
