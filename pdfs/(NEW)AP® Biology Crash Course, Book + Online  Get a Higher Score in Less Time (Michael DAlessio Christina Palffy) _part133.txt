Know the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium concept and how to use it. It is highly likely that there will be questions on the AP®
Biology exam that refer to it.
C. Microevolution—the change in the frequencies of alleles or genotypes in a population from
generation to generation (evolution on a small scale) usually occurs if any of the five conditions of
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are not met. Below are some ways the allele frequency can be
changed.
1. Genetic Drift—defined as changes in the gene pool due to chance because of a small population. The
small population directly contrasts the large population needed to maintain Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.
i.
Causes a significant genetic change (microevolution) of a species if only a few members of a
population migrate to find a new population.
ii. Causes genetic change (microevolution) anytime a species is reduced to very small numbers due to
chance events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, or habitat destruction.
