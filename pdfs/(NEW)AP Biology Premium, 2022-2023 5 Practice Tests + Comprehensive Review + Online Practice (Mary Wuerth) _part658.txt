Surfactants, like soap for example, are amphipathic molecules, which means they have both polar and
nonpolar components. So the surfactant will disrupt the formation of hydrogen bonds between the water
molecules, reducing the surface tension of the water. So fewer drops of water will be able to stay on the surface
of the penny. Choices (B) and (C) are incorrect because the surfactant will neither disrupt nor strengthen the
formation of polar ends, or covalent bonds, within the water molecules. The surfactant will decrease the surface
tension of water, so choice (D) is incorrect.
6. (C) The nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are the carriers of genetic information. Choices (A), (B), and (D) are
incorrect because carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins do not carry genetic information.
7. (D) A polypeptide chain with 15 amino acids would have 14 peptide bonds. Breaking each peptide bond would
require a hydrolysis reaction that would consume 1 molecule of water per bond, so 14 molecules of water wou
