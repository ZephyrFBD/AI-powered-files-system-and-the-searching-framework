on both batteries, as is the case
for most modern cars. The 
terminal is usually marked by a red color, often a red
cover. The safest procedure is to first connect the hot 
terminal of the weak
battery to the hot terminal of the good battery (using the cable with red clamps).
Spread apart the handles of each clamp to squeeze the contact tightly. Then 
connect the black cable, first to the ground terminal of the good battery, and the
other end to a clean exposed metal part (i.e., at ground) on the car with the weak
battery. (This last connection should preferably be not too close to the battery, which
in rare cases might leak 
gas that could ignite at the spark that may accompany
the final connection.) This is safer than connecting directly to the ground terminal.
When you are ready to start the disabled car, it helps to have the good car running
(to keep its battery fully charged). As soon as the disabled car starts, immediately
detach the cables in the exact reverse order (grou
