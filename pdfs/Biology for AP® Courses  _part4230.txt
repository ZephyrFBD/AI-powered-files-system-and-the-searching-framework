 hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food

Coral Reefs
Coral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the
ocean. They are found within 30Ëš north and south of the equator. The Great Barrier Reef is a well-known reef system
located several miles off the northeastern coast of Australia. Other coral reef systems are fringing islands, which are directly
adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now underwater. The coral
organisms (members of phylum Cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. These
calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef (Figure 35.23). Corals found in shallower waters
(at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular algae. The
relationship provides coral
