l) of a product equals the sum of the 
logs of the individual numbers.
log ab = log a + log b  ln ab = ln a + ln b
For the log of a quotient,
log1a>b2 = log a - log b  ln1a>b2 = ln a - ln b
Using the properties of exponents, we can also derive the rules for the logarithm of a 
number raised to a certain power.
 
log an = n log a      ln an
 = n ln a
 
log a1>n = 11>n2log a  
ln a1>n = 11>n2ln a
pH Problems
One of the most frequent uses for common logarithms in general chemistry is in working 
pH problems. The pH is defined as -log3H+4, where 3H+4 is the hydrogen ion concentration 
of a solution.  
 (Section 16.4) The following sample exercise illustrates this application.
1084 
APPENDIX A Mathematical Operations
(a) What is the pH of a solution whose hydrogen ion concentration is 0.015 M 
?
(b) If the pH of a solution is 3.80, what is its hydrogen ion concentration?
SOLUTION
(1)  
We are given the value of 3H+4. We use the LOG key of our  
calculator to calculate the value of log[H+].
