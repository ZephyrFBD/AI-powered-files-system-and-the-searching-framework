an aged cell to die, not to divide. The signals that trigger a cell to
undergo apoptosis come from both outside and inside a cell. (ENE-

(A) The cell will shrink because water potential is greater inside the
cell, and water will flow outward. Remember this fact: –0.7 is a
higher value than –0.9. Hypotonic solutions have greater water
potential than hypertonic ones. Also, adding solutes lowers the water
potential. (ENE-2 & SP 2)
(C) Proteins are produced in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes on the
ER and then packaged into vesicles in the Golgi and shipped to the
plasma membrane for release. The nucleus is not involved. (SYI-1)
(C) Insulin is a protein, and proteins are manufactured in the
ribosomes. They are located freely in the cytoplasm or as part of the
rough endoplasmic reticulum. (SYI-1)
(A) Microtubules are hollow tubes that consist of the protein tubulin.
They are organized in a 9 + 2 configuration and mak
