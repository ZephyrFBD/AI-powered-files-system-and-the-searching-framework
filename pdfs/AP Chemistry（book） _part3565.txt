Phosphoric acid and its salts find their most important uses in detergents and fer-
tilizers. The phosphates in detergents are often in the form of sodium tripolyphosphate 
1Na5P3O102. The phosphate ions “soften” water by binding their oxygen groups to the 
metal ions that contribute to the hardness of water. This keeps the metal ions from inter-
fering with the action of the detergent. The phosphates also keep the pH above 7 and 
thus prevent the detergent molecules from becoming protonated.
Most mined phosphate rock is converted to fertilizers. The Ca31PO422 in phosphate 
rock is insoluble 1Ksp = 2.0 * 10 - 292. It is converted to a soluble form for use in fertil-
izers by treatment with sulfuric or phosphoric acid. The reacti
