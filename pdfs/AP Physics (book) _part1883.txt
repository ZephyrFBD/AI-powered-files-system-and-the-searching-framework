on 17–11), is contained
in a byte. One byte is 8 bits, which means
each byte of 8 bits allows
possibilities
(that is, 0 to 255) or 256 shades for each of 3 colors: red, green, blue. The full
color of each pixel (the three subpixel colors) has 
possibilities.
Digital television signals, which we discuss in the next Section, are transmitted
at about 
Megabits per second. So 
pass a given point
per second, or one bit every 53 nanoseconds. We could write this in terms of
bytes as 2.4 MB s, where for bytes we use capital B.
When an analog signal, such as the pure sine wave of Fig. 17–22a, is converted
to digital (analog-to-digital converter, ADC), the digital signal may look like the
blue squared-off curve of Fig. 17–24. The digital signal has a limited number of
discrete values. The difference between the original continuous analog signal and
its digital approximation is called the quantization error or quantization loss. To min-
imize that loss, there are two important factors: (i) the re
