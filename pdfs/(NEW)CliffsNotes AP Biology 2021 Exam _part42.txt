ectrons are shared equally, and nonpolar covalent bonds form. The right end represents bonds that form when very
large differences in electronegativities exist. Electrons are transferred from one atom to another, and ionic bonds
form. When the electronegativities of the atoms are different, but not strongly so, the electrons are shared unequally,
and polar covalent bonds form; this activity is represented by the center of Figure 2-2. The kind of bond that forms
between two atoms and the strength of that bond depend upon the difference of electronegativities of the atoms and
might occur any place along the line shown in Figure 2-2.

Properties of Water
The polarity of water molecules and the hydrogen bonds that result from that polarity contribute to some very
special properties for water:
1. Water is an excellent solvent. Ionic substances are soluble (they dissolve) in water because the poles of the polar
water molecules interact with the ionic substances and separate them in
