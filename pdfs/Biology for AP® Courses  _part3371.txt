The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
and luteinizing hormone (LH). Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they
control the functioning of other organs. While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is
controlled by regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones
or inhibiting hormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. These travel from the
hypothalamus through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect. Negative
feedback then regulates how much of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is
secreted.
