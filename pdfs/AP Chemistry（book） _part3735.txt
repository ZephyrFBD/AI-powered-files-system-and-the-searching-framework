 com-
pound is a low-spin or high-spin complex. (c) Since there is a 
single peak in the visible absorption spectrum, the color of the 
compound should be complementary to the color of light that is 
absorbed most strongly. (d) Ethylenediamine is a stronger field 
ligand than NH3, so we expect a larger ∆ for 3Co(en)343+ than for 
3Co(NH3)643+.
Solve
(a) Co has an electron conﬁguration of 3Ar44s23d7, and Co3+ has 
three fewer electrons than Co. Because transition-metal ions 
always lose their valence shell s electrons, the electron conﬁg-
uration of Co3+ is 3Ar43d6.
(b) There are six valence electrons in the d orbitals. The ﬁlling of 
the t2 and e orbitals for both high-spin and low-spin com-
plexes is shown below. Because the compound is diamagnetic, 
we know all of the electrons must be paired up, which allows 
us to determine that 3Co(NH3)643+ is a low-spin complex.
