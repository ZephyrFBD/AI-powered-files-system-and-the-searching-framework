Then
To get the efficiency in percent, we multiply by 100. Thus, the maximum (or
Carnot) efficiency is 30%. Realistically, an engine might attain 0.70 of this value,
or 21%.
NOTE In this Example the exhaust temperature is still rather high, 270°C.
Steam engines are often arranged in series so that the exhaust of one engine is
used as intake by a second or third engine.

A phony claim? An engine manufacturer makes the
following claims: An engine’s heat input per second is 9.0 kJ at 435 K. The heat
output per second is 4.0 kJ at 285 K. Do you believe these claims?
APPROACH The engine’s efficiency can be calcula
