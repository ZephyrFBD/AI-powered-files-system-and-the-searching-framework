Calculations Based on Half-Life
The rate at which a sample decays is called its activity, and it is often expressed as 
number of disintegrations per unit time. The becquerel (Bq) is the SI unit for express-
ing activity. A becquerel is defined as one nuclear disintegration per second. An older, 
but still widely used, unit of activity is the curie (Ci), defined as 3.7 * 1010 disintegra-
tions per second, which is the rate of decay of 1 g of radium. Thus, a 4.0-mCi sample of 
cobalt-60 undergoes
 
4.0 * 10-3 Ci *
3.7 * 1010 disintegrations>s
1 Ci
= 1.5 * 108 disintegrations>s 
and so has an activity of 1.5 * 108 Bq.
As a radioactive sample decays, the amount of
