termine ∆G° and K for a redox reaction, 
using standard reduction potentials.
Plan We use the data in Table 20.1 and Equation 20.10 to 
determine E° for the reaction and then use E° in Equation 20.12  
to calculate ∆G°. We can then use either Equation 19.20 or  
Equation 20.13 to calculate K.

SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 20.10 
Using Standard Reduction Potentials to Calculate ∆G° and K
Even though the second half-reaction has  
4 Ag, we use the E °
red value directly from Ta-
ble 20.1 because emf is an intensive property.
 
Using Equation 20.10, we have:
 
The half-reactions show the transfer of four 
electrons. Thus, for this reaction n = 4. We 
now use Equation 20.12 to calculate ∆G°:
Now we need to calculate the equilibrium 
constant, K, using ∆G°
