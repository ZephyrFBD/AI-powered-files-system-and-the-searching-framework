ced and released by the pancreas, travels through the circulatory system to trigger responses in cells
all over the body.
Figure 10.4 Endocrine Signaling
There are many examples of endocrine signaling in everyday life. For example, the hormone ethylene can travel through the air to trigger the
ripening of fruits. Another example is the release of hormones called pheromones into the air by some animals and moths, which help them
locate and attract mates over long distances.
Signal Transduction
Signal transduction determines how a cell responds internally to a signal in its environment. Important processes,
such as gene expression, cell growth and division, and the release of hormones, depend on signal transduction.
Signal transduction begins with a chemical message or ligand. Ligands interact with specific target cells, which
respond to the presence of the ligand. Ligands may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Hydrophilic ligands cannot cross
the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane an
