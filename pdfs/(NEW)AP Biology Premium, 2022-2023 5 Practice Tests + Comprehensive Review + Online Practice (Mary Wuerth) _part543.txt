rm photosynthesis. Therefore,
algae either directly or indirectly provide organic compounds to the other members of this ecosystem.
(b)
(c)  Secondary consumers eat primary consumers. Primary consumers eat producers. The primary consumers
are snails, oysters, clams, and fish. Therefore, the secondary consumers are crabs, fish, and birds.
(d) Birds should have the fewest numbers since they are a top predator.
12. (a) The use of the insecticide significantly increased the mean dry weight of crop B. The upper limit of the 95%
confidence interval for crop B without the insecticide is 9.13, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence
interval for crop B in the presence of the insecticide is 9.44. So there is likely a significant difference
between the two groups.
(b)
(c) The researcherâ€™s claim is not supported by the data. This is because the 95% confidence intervals for plants
from crop A grown with and without insecticide overlap: the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for
crop A wi
