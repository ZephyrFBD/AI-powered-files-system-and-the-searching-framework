tonium coupled with the need for reprocessing is problematic in terms of nuclear 
nonproliferation. Thus, political factors coupled with increased safety concerns and 
higher operational costs make fast breeder reactors quite rare.

CHAPTER 21 Nuclear Chemistry
A considerable amount of research is being devoted to disposal of radioactive wastes. 
At present, the most attractive possibilities appear to be formation of glass, ceramic, or 
synthetic rock from the wastes as a means of immobilizing them. These solid materials 
would then be placed in containers of high corrosion resistance and durability and bur-
ied deep underground. The process of selecting appropriate deep repositories for high-
level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries. In the United States, the 
Department of Energy (DOE) had designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a disposal 
site, but in 2010 this project was discontinued because of technical and political con-
cerns. Unfortunately, there is
