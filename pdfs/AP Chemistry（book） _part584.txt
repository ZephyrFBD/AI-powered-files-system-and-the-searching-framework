called oxidation. The term oxidation is used because the first reactions of this sort to 
be studied were reactions with oxygen. Many metals react directly with O2 in air to form 
metal oxides. In these reactions, the metal loses electrons to oxygen, forming an ionic 
compound of the metal ion and oxide ion. The familiar example of rusting involves the 
reaction between iron metal and oxygen in the presence of water. In this process, Fe is 
oxidized (loses electron
