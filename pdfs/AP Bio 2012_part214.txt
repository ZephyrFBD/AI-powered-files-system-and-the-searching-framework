ransmission of genes from parent to 
offspring. The student will be able to use a diagram of the 
cross to support a 1:1:1:1 ratio predicted by independent 
assortment and will be able to recognize that the eye color 
and body color genes are linked with some recombination. 
The student will be able to predict the relative location of the 
genes on the chromosome by recognizing the recombinant 
phenotypes and calculating the ratio.
Characteristics of a 
WEAK Response 
The student is able to predict a 1:1:1:1 ratio based on 
independent assortment. The student may support this 
prediction with a Punnett square or diagram, or may 
recognize that the genes for eye color and body color are 
linked on the same chromosome.
Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 6
4 points maximum.
Student explanations include the following:
• 
Prediction of a 1:1:1:1 ratio with correct phenotypes based on independent 
assortment.
• 
Support for prediction with a diagram of the cross of BbEe x bbee.
•
