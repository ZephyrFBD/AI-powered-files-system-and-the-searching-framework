(a) above and below the central maximum, (b) to the left
and right of the central maximum.
31. (III) If parallel light falls on a single slit of width D at a
28.0° angle to the normal, describe the diffraction pattern.
24–6 and 24–7 Diffraction Gratings
32. (I) At what angle will 510-nm light produce a second-order
maximum when falling on a grating whose slits are
apart?
33. (I) A grating that has 3800 slits per cm produces a third-order
fringe at a 22.0° angle. What wavelength of light is being
used?
34. (I) A grating has 
How many spectral orders
can be seen (400 to 700 nm) when it is illuminated by white
light?
35. (II) Red laser light from a He–Ne laser 
creates a second-order fringe at 53.2° after passing through
the grating. What is the wavelength of light that creates a
first-order fringe at 20.6°?
36. (II) How many slits per centimeter does a grating have if
the third order occurs at a 15.0° angle for 620-nm light?
37. (II) A source prod
