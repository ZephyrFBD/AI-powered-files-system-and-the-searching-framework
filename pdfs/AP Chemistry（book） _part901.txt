 the wavelength of a spectral line, RH is the Rydberg constant 
11.096776 * 107 m- 12, and n1 and n2 are positive integers, with n2 being larger than 
n1. How could the remarkable simplicity of this equation be explained? It took nearly 30 
more years to answer this question.
Bohr’s Model
Rutherford’s discovery of the nuclear atom 
 (Section 2.2) suggested that an atom 
might be thought of as a “microscopic solar system” in which the electrons orbit the 
nucleus. To explain the line spectrum of hydrogen, Bohr assumed that electrons in 
hydrogen atoms move in circular orbits around the nucleus, but this assumption posed a 
problem. According to classical physics, a charged particle (such as an electron) moving 
in a circular path should continuously lose energy. As an electron loses energy, there-
fore, it should spiral into the positively charged nucleus. This behavior, however, does 
not happen—hydrogen atoms are stable. So how can we explain this apparent  
violation 
of the laws of
