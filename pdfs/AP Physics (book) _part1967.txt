 60 mA.
NOTE With the smaller current in part (b), the bulb filament’s temperature would
be lower and the bulb less bright. Also, resistance does depend on temperature
(Section 18–4), so our calculation is only a rough approximation.
EXERCISE C What is the resistance of a lightbulb if 0.50 A flows through it when 120 V
is connected across it?
All electric devices, from heaters to lightbulbs to stereo amplifiers, offer
resistance to the flow of current. The filaments of lightbulbs (Fig.18–5) and electric
heaters are special types of wires whose resistance results in their becoming very 
hot. Generally, the connecting wires have very low resistance in comparison to the 
resistance of the wire filaments or coils, so the connecting wires usually have a 
minimal effect on the magnitude of the current.†
