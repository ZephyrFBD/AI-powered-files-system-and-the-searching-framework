r the
Big Bang, there were about 7 times more protons than
neutrons. Explain how this leads to a ratio of the mass of
hydrogen to the mass of helium of 3:1. This is about the
actual ratio observed in the universe.
6. Explain what the 2.7-K cosmic microwave background
radiation is. Where does it come from? Why is its tempera-
ture now so low?
7. We cannot use Hubble’s law to measure the distances to
nearby galaxies, because their random motions are larger
than the overall expansion. Indeed, the closest galaxy to
us, the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, is
approaching us at a speed of about 
(a) What is
the shift in wavelength of the 656-nm line of hydrogen
emitted from the Andromeda Galaxy, as seen by us? (b) Is
this a redshift or a blueshift? (c) Ignoring the expansion,
how soon will it and the Milky Way Galaxy collide?
130 kms.
