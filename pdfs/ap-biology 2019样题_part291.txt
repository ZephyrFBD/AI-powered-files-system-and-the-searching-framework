Science Practice 6: Develop and justify scientific arguments  
using evidence.
Students should be able to write and evaluate scientific 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Essential skills include 
the ability to analyze, interpret, and make predictions 
from a model or the data obtained in an experiment and 
the ability to justify the reasoning for a prediction and/

of DNA containing a designated mutational change, 
students can predict the effect of the mutation on the 
encoded polypeptide
