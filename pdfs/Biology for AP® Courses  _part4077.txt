the
release of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The
inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The
level of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.
If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone
decrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The
decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and
starting the cycles again. Figure 34.19 visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate
hormone levels.
