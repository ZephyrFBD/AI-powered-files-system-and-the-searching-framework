s, choice (A) is incorrect. The amounts of carbon dioxide
produced and oxygen consumed are the dependent variables, so choices (C) and (D) are incorrect.
20. (C) The mung beans at 25째 Celsius increased the level of carbon dioxide from 400 to 600 ppm over the 30-
minute period, so the rate is 
 per minute. The mung beans at 4째 Celsius
increased the level of carbon dioxide from 400 to 450 ppm over the 30-minute period, so that rate is 
 per minute. Based on this data, the mung beans at 25째 Celsius have a
higher respiration rate than the mung beans at 4째 Celsius. Thus, choice (C) is the only correct statement, and
choices (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.
21. (C) Paracrine signaling stimulates nearby cells. Autocrine signaling stimulates the same cell that produces the
signal, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (B) is incorrect because juxtacrine signaling occurs between cells that
are in direct contact (touching). Endocrine signals travel long distances, either through circulatory systems
