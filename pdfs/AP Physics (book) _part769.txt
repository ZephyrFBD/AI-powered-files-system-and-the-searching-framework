cm during impact, and
when the legs are bent, about 50 cm.
[Hint: The average net force on
him, which is related to impulse,
is the vector sum of gravity and
the force exerted by the ground.
See Fig. 7–34.] We will see in
Chapter 9 that the force in (b)
exceeds the ultimate strength of
bone (Table 9–2).
7;4 and 7;5 Elastic Collisions
25. (II) A ball of mass 0.440 kg moving east (
direction)
with a speed of 
collides head-on with a 0.220-kg
ball at rest. If the collision is perfectly elastic, what will be
the speed and direction of each ball after the collision?
26. (II) A 0.450-kg hockey puck, moving east with a speed of
has a head-on collision with a 0.900-kg puck ini-
tially at rest. Assuming a perfectly elastic collision, what will
be the speed and direction of each puck after the collision?
27. (II) A 0.060-kg tennis ball, moving with a speed of
has a head-on collision with a 0.090-kg ball ini-
tially moving in the same direction at a speed of
