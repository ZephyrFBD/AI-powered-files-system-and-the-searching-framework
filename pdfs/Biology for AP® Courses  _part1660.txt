Scientists discovered a strand of mRNA translated into a sequence of amino acids (polypeptide) shorter than the mRNA
molecule transcribed from DNA. Before the information in eukaryotic mRNA is translated into protein, it is modified or
edited in several ways. A 5′ methylguanosine (or GTP) cap and a 3′ poly-A tail are added to protect mature mRNA from
degradation and allow its export from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and
exons are reconnected. Exons can be reconnected in different sequences, a phenomenon referred to as alternative gene
splicing, which allows a single eukaryotic gene to code for different proteins. (We will explore the significance of alternative
gene splicing in more detail in other chapters.)
