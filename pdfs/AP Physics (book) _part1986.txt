18–6 Power in Household Circuits
The electric wires that carry electricity to lights and other electric appliances in
houses and buildings have some resistance, although usually it is quite small.
Nonetheless, if the current is large enough, the wires will heat up and produce
thermal energy at a rate equal to 
where R is the wire’s resistance. One possi-
ble hazard is that the current-carrying wires in the wall of a building may become
so hot as to start a fire. Thicker wires hav
