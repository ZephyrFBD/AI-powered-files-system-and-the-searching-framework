52. (II) If a compressive force of
is exerted on the
end of a 22-cm-long bone of cross-sectional area 
(a) will the bone break, and (b) if not, by how much does 
it shorten?
53. (II) (a) What is the minimum cross-sectional area required
of a vertical steel cable from which is suspended a 270-kg
chandelier? Assume a safety factor of 7.0. (b) If the cable
is 7.5 m long, how much does it elongate?
54. (II) Assume the supports of the uniform cantilever shown in
Fig. 9â€“76 
are made of wood. Calculate the
minimum cross-sectional area required of each, assuming
a safety factor of 9.0.

55. (II) An iron bolt is used to connect two iron plates
together. The bolt must withstand shear forces up to about
3300 N. Calculate the minimum diameter for the bolt, based
on a safety factor of 7.0.
