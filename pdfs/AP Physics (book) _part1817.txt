*40. (II) A cube of side 8.50 cm is placed in a uniform field
with edges parallel to the field lines.
(a) What is the net flux through the cube? (b) What is the
flux through each of its six faces?
*41. (II) The electric field between two parallel square metal
plates is 
The plates are 0.85 m on a side and are
separated by 3.0 cm. What is the charge on each plate
(assume equal and opposite)? Neglect edge effects.
*42. (II) The field just outside a 3.50-cm-radius metal ball is
and points toward the ball. What charge
resides on the ball?
*43. (III) A point charge Q rests at the center of an uncharged
thin spherical conducting shell. (See Fig. 16–34.) What is
the electric field E as a function of r (a) for r less than 
the inner radius of the shell, (b) inside the shell, and
(c) beyond the shell? (d) How does the shell affect the field
due to Q alone? How does the charge Q affect the shell?
