FIGURE 32–2 Diagram of a
cyclotron. The magnetic field,
applied by a large electromagnet,
points into the page. The protons
start at A, the ion source. The red
electric field lines shown are for the
alternating electric field in the gap at
a certain moment.

An important aspect of the cyclotron is that the frequency of the applied
voltage, as given by Eq. 32–2, does not depend on the radius r of the particle’s
path. Thus the frequency does not have to be changed as the protons or ions start
from the source and are accelerated to paths of larger and larger radii. But this is
only true at nonrelativistic energies. At higher speeds, the momentum (Eq. 26–4)
is 
so m in Eq. 32–2 has to be replaced by 
and
the cyclotron frequency f (Eq. 32–2) depends on speed v because does. To keep
