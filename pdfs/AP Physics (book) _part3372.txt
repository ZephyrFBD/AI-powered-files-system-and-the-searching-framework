The number of decays that occur in the short time interval 
is designated 
because each decay that occurs corresponds to a decrease by one in the number N
of parent nuclei present. That is, radioactive decay is a “one-shot”process, Fig.30–9.
Once a particular parent nucleus decays into its daughter, it cannot do it again.
Exponential Decay
Equation 30–3a or b can be solved for N (using calculus) and the result is
(30;4)
where 
is the number of parent nuclei present at any chosen time 
and N
is the number remaining after a time . The symbol e is the natural exponential
(encountered earlier in Sections 19–6 and 21–12) whose value is
Thus the number of parent nuclei in a sample decreases exponentially in time.
This is shown in Fig. 30–10a for the decay of 
. Equatio
