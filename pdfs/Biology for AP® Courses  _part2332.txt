 viruses are filamentous, including TMV. Isometric viruses
have shapes that are roughly spherical, such as poliovirus or herpesviruses. Enveloped viruses have membranes surrounding
capsids. Animal viruses, such as HIV, are frequently enveloped. Head and tail viruses infect bacteria and have a head that is
similar to icosahedral viruses and a tail shape like filamentous viruses.
Many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors
(Figure 21.3). For these viruses, attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane, so they can
complete their replication inside the cell. The receptors that viruses use are molecules that are normally found on cell
surfaces and have their own physiological functions. Viruses have simply evolved to make use of these molecules for their
own replication. For example, HIV uses the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes as one of its receptors. CD4 is a type of
molecule called a cel
