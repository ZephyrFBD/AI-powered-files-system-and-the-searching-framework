s cannot be
consciously controlled, as is the case with
skeletal muscles.
c.
Voluntary muscles cannot be consciously
controlled, as is the case with the movement of
legs while walking. Involuntary muscles can be
controlled by an individual’s will, as is the case
with muscles in the digestive system.
d.
Voluntary muscles can be controlled by an
individual’s will, as is the case with skeletal
muscles. Involuntary muscles cannot be
consciously controlled, as is the case with
cardiac muscles.
35. How would muscle contractions be affected if ATP
was completely depleted in a muscle fiber?
a.
Myosin heads will detach rapidly from the actin-
binding sites, resulting in muscle relaxation. In a
live person this causes rigor mortis, while in a
recently dead person it results in “writer’s
cramp”.
b.
Myosin heads will not detach from the actin-
binding sites, resulting in muscle stiffness. In a
live person this causes rigor mortis, while in a
recently dead person it results in “writer’s
cramp”.
