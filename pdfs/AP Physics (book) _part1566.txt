to their surface area. The energy radiated (or absorbed) also
depends on the nature of the surface (dark surfaces absorb and
radiate more than do bright shiny ones), which is characterized
by the emissivity,
Radiation from the Sun arrives at the surface of the Earth
on a clear day at a rate of about 1000 Wm2.

Summary
1. What happens to the work done on a jar of orange juice
when it is vigorously shaken?
2. When a hot object warms a cooler object, does tempera-
ture flow between them? Are the temperature changes of
the two objects equal? Explain.
3. (a) If two objects of different temperatures are placed in
contact, will heat naturally flow from the object with higher
internal energy to the object with lower internal energy?
(b) Is it possible for heat to flow even if the internal energies
of the two objects are the same? Explain.
4. In warm regions where tropical plants grow but the tem-
perature may drop below freezing a few times in the
winter, the des
