understanding how breathing occurs enhances ones understanding of the structure and function of the respiratory system.
Mammalian lungs are located in the thoracic cavity where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal
muscles, and bound by the chest wall. The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that
facilitates breathing. Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm.
Types of Breathing
Amphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing. Young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they don’t
leave the water. Some amphibians retain gills for life. As the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow. These
lungs are primitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs. Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so
breathing via lungs is forced. The
