oblem 17.35 is true or false.
(a) The pH at the beginning of the two titrations will be 
the same.
(b) The titration curves will both be essentially the same 
after passing the equivalence point.
(c) Methyl red would be a suitable indicator for both 
titrations.
 
17.37  Predict whether the equivalence point of each of the following 
titrations is below, above, or at pH 7: (a) NaHCO3 titrated with 
NaOH, (b) NH3 titrated with HCl, (c) KOH titrated with HBr.
 17.38  Predict whether the equivalence point of each of the fol-
lowing titrations is below, above, or at pH 7: (a) formic acid 
titrated with NaOH, (b) calcium hydroxide titrated with 
perchloric acid, (c) pyridine titrated with nitric acid.
 17.39  As shown in Figure 16.8, the indicator thymol blue has two 
color changes. Which color change will generally be more 
suitable for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base?
 17.40  Assume that 30.0 mL of a 0.10 M solution of a weak base B 
that accepts one proton is titrated wit
