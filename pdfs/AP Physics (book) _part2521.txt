cas when different planes (distances) are involved.
Mirror
These rays strike the
mirror, and they are
essentially parallel.
FIGURE 23–12 If the object’s distance is large compared to the size of the mirror 
(or lens), the rays arrive nearly parallel. They are parallel for an object at infinity (q).
Focal Point and Focal Length
To see how spherical mirrors form images, we first consider an object that is very
far from a concave mirror. For a distant object, as shown in Fig. 23–12, the rays
from each point on the object that strike the mirror will be nearly parallel. For an object
infinitely far away (the Sun and stars approach this), the rays would be precisely parallel.
Now consider such parallel rays falling on a concave mirror as in Fig. 23–13.
The law of reflection holds for each of these rays at the point each strikes the
mirror. As can be seen, they are not all brought to a single point. In order to form
a sharp image, the rays must come to a point. Thus a spherical mirror will no
