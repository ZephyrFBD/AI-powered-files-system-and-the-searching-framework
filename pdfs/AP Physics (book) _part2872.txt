focal length of the objective
lens is 0.65 cm. What is the magnification of the microscope?
44. (I) A 
microscope uses a 0.40-cm-focal-length objective
lens. If the barrel length is 17.5 cm, what is the focal length
of the eyepiece? Assume a normal eye and that the final
image is at infinity.
45. (I) A 17-cm-long microscope has an eyepiece with a focal
length of 2.5 cm and an objective with a focal length of
0.33 cm. What is the approximate magnification?

46. (II) A microscope has a
eyepiece and a
objective
lens 20.0 cm apart. Calculate (a) the total magnification,
(b) the focal length of each lens, and (c) where the object
must be for a normal relaxed eye to see it in focus.
47. (II) Repeat Problem 46 assuming that the final image is
located 25 cm from the eyepiece (near point of a normal eye).
48. (II) A microscope has a 1.8-cm-focal-length eyepiece and a
0.80-cm objective. Assuming a relaxed normal eye, calcu-
