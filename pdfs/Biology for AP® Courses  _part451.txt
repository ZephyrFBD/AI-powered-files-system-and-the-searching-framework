 Lysosomes digest macromolecules, recycle worn-out
organelles, and destroy pathogens. Just like your body uses different organs that work together, cells use these organelles
interact to perform specific functions. For example, proteins that are synthesized in the RER then travel to the Golgi
apparatus for modification and packaging for either storage or transport. If these proteins are hydrolytic enzymes, they can
be stored in lysosomes. Mitochondria produce the energy needed for these processes. This functional flow through several
organelles, a process which is dependent on energy produced by yet another organelle, serves as a hallmark illustration of
the cell’s complex, interconnected dependence on its organelles.
