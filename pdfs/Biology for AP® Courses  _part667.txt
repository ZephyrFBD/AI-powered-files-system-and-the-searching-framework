omplex molecules from simpler ones, and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down.
The fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential
energy. In fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which is eventually
harnessed for use. This is because these bonds can release energy when broken. The type of potential energy that exists
within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy (Figure 6.7). Chemical
energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food. The release of energy is brought about by breaking
the molecular bonds within fuel molecules.
