te concentration relative to other solutions are said
to be hypotonic, whereas solutions higher in solute than others are
hypertonic. When two solutions have the same solute concentration as
each other, they are said to be isotonic. The cell membrane eï¬€ectively
separates two distinct solutions: the extracellular environment and the
cytoplasm. If the outside of a cell is hypertonic (e.g., a cell has just been
moved from fresh water to salt water), water will move out of the cell into
the high solute solution. If possible, some of those solutes will also move
into the cell until a balance has been established so that both areas are
equivalent in solute concentration. In hypotonic solutions, cells generally
take on water, sometimes until they burst.
AP EXPERT NOTE
In isotonic solutions, water and solutes can and do move across
the membrane, yet movement inward is always balanced by
reciprocal movement outward. This means that overall
concentrations of water and solute on opposite sides of
