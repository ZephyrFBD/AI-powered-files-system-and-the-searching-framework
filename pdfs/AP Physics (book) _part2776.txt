25–7 When the lens is positioned to focus on a nearby object,
points on a distant object produce circles and are therefore blurred.
(The effect is shown greatly exaggerated.)

Shutter speed. To improve the depth of
field, you “stop down” your camera lens by two f-stops from 
4 to 
8. What
should you do to the shutter speed to maintain the same exposure?
RESPONSE The amount of light admitted by the lens is proportional to the
area of the lens opening. Reducing the lens opening by two f-stops reduces the
diameter by a factor of 2, and the area by a factor of 4. To maintain the same
exposure, the shutter must be open four times as long. If the shutter speed had
been
you would have to increase the exposure time to
Picture Sharpness
The sharpness of a picture depends not only on accurate focusing and short exposure
times, but also on the graininess of the film, or number
