K activates nuclear regulatory proteins,
called transcription factors, which turn genes on or off. These genes manage cell division and cell differentiation.
Note that the Ras protein associated with the RTK receptor and the G protein associated with a GPCR are both G
proteins because they are activated when a GTP replaces a GDP, but the series of steps that define the pathways of
these two receptors is very different. Ras is the first cytoplasmic enzyme in a kinase cascade, whereas the G protein
associated with a GPCR is membrane bound and activates another membrane-bound effector protein.
Intracellular Receptors
In contrast to the membrane-bound receptor proteins discussed earlier, intracellular receptors are positioned in the
cytoplasm or nucleus. The ligands for these intracellular receptor proteins are small molecules or lipidsoluble,
nonpolar molecules that can passively diffuse across the plasma
membrane. Ligands also include second messengers, like IP3, that are
products of a s
