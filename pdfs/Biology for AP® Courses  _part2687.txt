Animals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location. Plants, however, are rooted in place and
must respond to the surrounding environmental factors. Plants have sophisticated systems to detect and respond to light,
gravity, temperature, and physical touch. Receptors sense environmental factors and relay the information to effector
systems—often through intermediate chemical messengers—to bring about plant responses.
Plant Responses to Light
Plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low-molecular-
weight sugars using only carbon dioxide, light, and water. Photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in
response to light. It allows plants to optimize their use of light and space. Photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track
time. Plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight. Phototropism
is a directional response that
