 infecting a host at the same time are quite
uncommon. (C) is incorrect because the most successful viruses from a
previous year would still be recognizable by an immune system that
was inoculated against them. (D) is incorrect because viruses do not
use meiosis to reproduce, so crossing over cannot occur in viruses.

Plasmids may contain genes for antibiotic resistance or other
characteristics that can help bacteria survive in adverse
circumstances, but they are independent of the bacterial chromosome
that contains genes for essential functions. (C) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because genes for growth control are generally contained in
the bacterial chromosome. (B) is incorrect because some bacteria
contain no plasmids but are still able to reproduce. (D) is incorrect
because plasmids are not the main DNA molecules found in bacteria;
the circular bacterial chromosome contains genes for essential
enzymes.
