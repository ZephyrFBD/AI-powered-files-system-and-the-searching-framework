progeny as possible in order to increase their odds of transmission to other
hosts.
3.
C
They would be considered secondary consumers because they consume the primary consumers (plankton),
which consume algae (the producers).
4.
C
Since brook trout can tolerate pH values as low as 4.9 and do not appear to diminish, the pH of the creek must
exceed 4.9, so eliminate (D). Since crayfish cannot tolerate pH levels lower than 5.4, the pH of the stream must
have dropped lower than this value. Only (C) falls in this range.
5.
C
Only acid rain would directly explain why the pH would drop in the creek over the time period.
6.
D
Based on Table 1, the pH must exceed 6.1 for snails to be able to return to the creek ecosystem.
7.
D
Choices (A) and (B) refer to light and gravity responses of plants. Choice (C) is not an actual tropismâ€”it is a
made-up word. Thigmotropism is the term for the way in which plants respond to touch. The correct answer is
(D).
8.
D
If (D) is a correct statement, then simply
