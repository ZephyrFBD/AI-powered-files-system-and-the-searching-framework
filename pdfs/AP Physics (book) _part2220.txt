ent in each loop produces a magnetic field, as we saw in Fig. 20–9. The
magnetic field within a solenoid can be fairly large because it is the sum of the fields
due to the current in each loop (Fig. 20–28). A solenoid acts like a magnet; one end
can be considered the north pole and the other the south pole, depending on the direc-
tion of the current in the loops (use the right-hand rule). Since the magnetic field
lines leave the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the solenoid in Fig. 20–28 is
on the right. As we will see in the next Section, the magnetic field inside a tightly
wrapped solenoid with N turns of wire in a length 
each carrying current I, is
(20;8)
If a piece of iron is placed inside a solenoid, the magnetic field is increased
greatly because the iron becomes a magnet. The resulting magnetic field is the sum
of the field due to the current and the field due to the iron, and can be hundreds or
thousands of times the field due to the current alone (see Section 20–12)
