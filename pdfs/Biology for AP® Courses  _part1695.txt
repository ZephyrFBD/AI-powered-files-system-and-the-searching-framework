; a tRNA that interacts with a start codon,
binds directly to the ribosome P site, and links to a special methionine to begin a polypeptide chain
non–protein-coding intervening sequences that are spliced from mRNA during processing
determines the correct initiation AUG in a eukaryotic mRNA; the following consensus sequence must
appear around the AUG: 5’-GCC(purine)CCAUGG-3’; the bolded bases are most important
one of the three mRNA codons that specifies termination of translation
strand of DNA that is not used to transcribe mRNA; this strand is identical to the mRNA except that
T nucleotides in the DNA are replaced by U nucleotides in the mRNA
(ATTTGCAT) nonessential eukaryotic promoter sequence that binds cellular factors to increase the
efficiency of transcription; may be present several times in a promoter
