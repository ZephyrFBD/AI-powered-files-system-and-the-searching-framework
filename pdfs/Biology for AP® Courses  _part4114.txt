m the man and they are combined with
the eggs and supported through several cell divisions to ensure viability of the zygotes. When the embryos have reached
the eight-cell stage, one or more is implanted into the womanâ€™s uterus. If fertilization is not accomplished by simple IVF,
a procedure that injects the sperm into an egg can be used. This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and is
shown in Figure 34.32. IVF procedures produce a surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for
future use. The procedures can also result in multiple births.
