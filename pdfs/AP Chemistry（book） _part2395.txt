2. Br21g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ 2 BrCl1g2 
 
Kc2 =
3BrCl42
3Br243Cl24 = 7.2
The net sum of these two equations is:
3. 2 NOBr1g2 + Cl21g2 ∆ 2 NO1g2 + 2 BrCl1g2
You can prove algebraically that the equilibrium-constant expression for the net reaction 
is the product of the expressions for individual reactions:
 
Kc3 =
3NO423BrCl42
3NOBr423Cl24
=
3NO423Br24
3NOBr42
*
3BrCl42
3Br243Cl24 
Thus,
 
Kc3 = 1Kc121Kc22 = 10.014217.22 = 0.10 
To summarize:
 1. The equilibrium constant of a reaction in the reverse direction is the inverse (or recip-
rocal) of the equilibrium constant of the reaction in the forward direction:
A + B  ∆ C + D K1
C + D  ∆ A + B K = 1>K1
 2. The equilibrium constant of a reaction that has been multiplied by a number is equal 
to the original equilibrium constant raised to a power equal to that number.
A + B 
 ∆ C + D  K1
n A + n B  ∆ n C + n D K = K1
n
 3. The equilibrium constant for a net reaction made up by adding two or more reactions 
is the product of the equilibrium c
