 that catalyzes this reaction is called rubisco and is
the most abundant enzyme on Earth. The resulting six-carbon compound
is promptly split, resulting in the formation of two molecules of 3-
phosphoglycerate, a three-carbon compound. The 3-phosphoglycerate is
then phosphorylated by ATP and reduced by NADPH, which leads to the
formation of phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). This can then be utilized as
a starting point for the synthesis of glucose, starch, proteins, and fats.

OVERVIEW OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION
13.3 Explain energy pathways for glycolysis and fermentation
Cellular respiration is the most eﬀicient catabolic pathway used by
organisms to harvest the energy stored in glucose. Whereas glycolysis
yields only 2 ATP per molecule of glucose, cellular respiration can yield 36
–38 ATP. Cellular respiration is an ae
