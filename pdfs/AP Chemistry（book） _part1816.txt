 crystalline phase and 
an ordinary liquid phase similar? How are they different?
 11.66  What observations made by Reinitzer on cholesteryl 
benzoate suggested that this substance possesses a liquid 
crystalline phase?
 11.67  Indicate whether each statement is true or false: (a) The liq-
uid crystal state is another phase of matter, just like solid, 
liquid, and gas. (b) Liquid crystalline molecules are gener-
ally spherical in shape. (c) Molecules that exhibit a liquid 
crystalline phase do so at well-deÔ¨Åned temperatures and 
pressures. (d) Molecules that exhibit a liquid crystalline 
phase show weaker-than-expected intermolecular forces. 
(e) Molecules containing only carbon and hydrogen are 
likely to form liquid crystalline phases. (f) Molecules can 
exhibit more than one liquid crystalline phase.
 11.68  Two heating curves, A and B, are shown. In both cases, 
point 1 corresponds to the crystalline solid phase.
