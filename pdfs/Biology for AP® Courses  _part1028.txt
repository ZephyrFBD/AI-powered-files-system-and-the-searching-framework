o the extracellular domain of cell-
surface receptors. This group of ligands is quite diverse and includes small molecules, peptides, and proteins.
Other Ligands
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that also acts as a ligand. It is able to diffuse directly across the plasma membrane, and one of
its roles is to interact with receptors in smooth muscle and induce relaxation of the tissue. NO has a very short half-life and
therefore only functions over short distances. Nitroglycerin, a treatment for heart disease, acts by triggering the release of
NO, which causes blood vessels to dilate (expand), thus restoring blood flow to the heart.

Think About It
•
Cells grown in the laboratory are placed in a solution containing a dye that is unable to pass through
the plasma membrane. If a ligand is then added to the solution, observations show that the dye enters
the cell. Describe the type of receptor the ligand most likely binds to and explain your reasoning.
