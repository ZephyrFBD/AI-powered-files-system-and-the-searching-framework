; abundance 69.17%) and 65Cu (atomic 
mass = 64.9278 amu; abundance 30.83%). Calculate the 
atomic weight (average atomic mass) of copper.
 2.36 Rubidium has two naturally occurring isotopes, rubidium-85 
1atomic mass = 84.9118 amu; abundance = 72.15%2 and 
rubidium-87 1atomic mass = 86.9092 amu; abundance =
27.85%2. Calculate the atomic weight of rubidium.
 2.37 (a) Thomsonâ€™s cathode-ray tube (Figure 2.4) and the mass 
spectrometer (Figure 2.11) both involve the use of electric 
or magnetic fields to deflect charged particles. What are the 
charged particles involved in each of these experiments? 
 
(b) What are the labels on the axes of a mass spectrum? (c) To 
measure the mass spectrum of an atom, the atom must first 
lose one or more electrons. Which would you expect to be 
deflected more by the same setting of the electric and mag-
netic fields, a Cl+ or a Cl2+ ion?
