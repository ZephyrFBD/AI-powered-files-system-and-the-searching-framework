or contributors to acid rain. One method of prevent-
ing the escape of SO2 from industrial operations is to react it with 
CaO to form calcium sulfite CaSO3.
Photochemical smog is a complex mixture in which both nitro-
gen oxides and ozone play important roles. Smog components are 
generated mainly in automobile engines, and smog control consists 
largely of controlling auto emissions.
Carbon dioxide and water vapor are the major components 
of the atmosphere that strongly absorb infrared radiation. CO2 
and H2O are therefore critical in maintaining Earth’s surface 
temperature. The concentrations of CO2 and other so-called 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are thus important in deter-
mining global climate. Because of the extensive combustion of 
fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), the concentration of car-
bon dioxide in the atmosphere is steadily increasing, which in 
turn appears to be contributing to an increase in the average tem-
perature of the Earth.
