(“snake” and “sympathetic” both begin with “s”). Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system
include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions help prepare an organism’s body for the physical
strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator.
Figure 26.27 The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have opposing effects on target organs.
Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord, as illustrated in Figure 26.27.
The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia (the sympathetic
ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord). The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons.
Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs. As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a
big test, speech, or athletic event can attest, the effects of the sympathetic nervo
