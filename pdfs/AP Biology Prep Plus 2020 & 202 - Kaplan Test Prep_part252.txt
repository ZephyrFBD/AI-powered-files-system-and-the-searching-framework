s over 100 meters in height and creating channels for the delivery of
important soil nutrients. Water loss became a constant challenge in
environments where rainfall could be unpredictable or nearly
nonexistent. The Sun, formerly relied upon solely for light-giving energy,
also became a source of dehydration and overheating.
One of a plantâ€™s many challenges is providing all of its structures with the
water needed to complete photosynthesis and to maintain an aqueous
solution for all biological reactions. Water is heavy and a plant cannot

rely on muscular contractions to move materials, as animals do. Instead,
a plant has narrow, lifeless channels in its xylem tissue that take
advantage of the cohesive properties of water. A plant loses the majority
of its water during transpiration while its stomata are open for the
exchange of CO2 and O2 in photosynthesis. As water is lost through the
leaves, it creates a negative pressure in the xylem channels, just like
sucking
