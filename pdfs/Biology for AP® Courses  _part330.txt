oxyribose
in DNA and ribose in RNA), a nitrogenous base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine or uracil), and a phosphate
group. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell that is passed from parent to offspring via cell division. DNA has a
double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel), connected by hydrogen bonds and
complementary to each other. In DNA, purines pair with pyrimidines: adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs
with guanine (C-G). In RNA, uracil replaces thymine to pair with adenine (U-A). RNA also differs from DNA in that it is
single-stranded and has many forms, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA)
that all participate in the synthesis of proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the use of mRNA. The flow of genetic
information is usually DNA → RNA → protein, also known as the Central Dogma of Life.
