LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-3.D
Describe the role of 
components of a signal 
transduction pathway 
in producing a cellular 
response.
a. After the ligand binds, the intracellular 
domain of a receptor protein changes shape
initiating transduction of the signal.
b. Second messengers (such as cyclic AMP) 
are molecules that relay and amplify the 
intracellular signal.
c. Binding of ligand-to-ligand-gated channels 
can cause the channel to open or close.
