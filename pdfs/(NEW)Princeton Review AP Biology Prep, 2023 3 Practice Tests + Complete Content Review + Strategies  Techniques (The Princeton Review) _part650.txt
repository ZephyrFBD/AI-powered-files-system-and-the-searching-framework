ral infection, (A), increased appetite, (B), and meiotic division, (C), are not responses to
the environment.
34. B
The gross primary productivity is the total amount of energy stored, but the plant has energy needs of its own
that are fulfilled with cellular respiration. Choice (A) is true but not relevant to this question. Choice (C) is not
true, because heterotrophs must get energy from autotrophs. Choice (D) is not true because most biomass is
stored at the producer level.
35. A
Choice (B) is incorrect: these organisms exhibit the same behavior because they were subjected to the same
environmental conditions and similar habitats. This is an example of convergent evolution. These organisms
are not genetically similar, so (C) is incorrect. (One is an insect, and the other a bird.) They are analogous, so
(D) is also incorrect. They exhibit the same function but are structurally different.
36. C
A mutualistic relationship is a relationship among two organisms in which both benefit. Cho
