†Different films have different sensitivities to light, referred to as the “film speed” and specified as an
“ISO (or ASA) number.” A “faster” film is more sensitive and needs less light to produce a good
image, but is grainier which you see when the image is enlarged. Digital cameras may have a “gain” or
“ISO” adjustment for sensitivity. A typical everyday ISO might be 200 or so. Adjusting a CCD to be
“faster” (high ISO like 3200) for low light conditions results in “noise,” resulting in graininess just as
in film cameras.

f-stops and the focusing ring are on
the camera lens. Shutter speeds are
selected on the small wheel on top
of the camera body.
Focusing Focusing is the operation of placing the lens at the correct position
relative to the sensor or film for the sharpest image. The image distance is
smallest for objects at infinity (the symbol 
is used for infinity) and is equal to
th
