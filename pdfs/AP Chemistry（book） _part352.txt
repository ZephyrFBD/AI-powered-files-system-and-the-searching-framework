racterization of subatomic particles. Thom-
son’s experiments on the behavior of cathode rays in magnetic and 
electric fields led to the discovery of the electron and allowed its 
charge-to-mass ratio to be measured. Millikan’s oil-drop experi-
ment determined the charge of the electron. Becquerel’s discovery 
of radioactivity, the spontaneous emission of radiation by atoms, 
gave further evidence that the atom has a substructure. Ruther-
ford’s studies of how a particles scatter when passing through thin 
metal foils led to the nuclear model of the atom, showing that the 
atom has a dense, positively charged nucleus.
THE MODERN VIEW OF ATOMIC STRUCTURE (SECTION 2.3) At-
oms have a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons; electrons 
 
move in the space around the nucleus. The magnitude of the charge 
of the electron, 1.602 * 10-19 C, is called the electronic charge. The 
charges of particles are usually represented as multiples of this 
charge—an electron has a 1- charge, and a pro
