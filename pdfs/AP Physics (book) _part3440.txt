Neutron Physics
The artificial transmutation of elements took a great leap forward in the 1930s
when Enrico Fermi realized that neutrons would be the most effective projectiles
for causing nuclear reactions and in particular for producing new elements.
Because neutrons have no net electric charge, they are not repelled by positively
charged nuclei as are protons or alpha particles. Hence the probability of a
neutron reaching the nucleus and causing a reaction is much greater than for
charged projectiles,† particularly at low energies. Between 1934 and 1936, Fermi
and his co-workers
