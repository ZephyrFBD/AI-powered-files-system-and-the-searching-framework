o the motor end plate, where it binds
with ACh receptors. As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open, and Na+ ions cross the membrane into the muscle
cell. This reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization. As ACh
binds at the motor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The depolarization then spreads along the
sarcolemma, creating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in
voltage and open. The action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of depolarization.
ACh is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides in the synaptic
cleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle
contraction (Figure 29.38).
