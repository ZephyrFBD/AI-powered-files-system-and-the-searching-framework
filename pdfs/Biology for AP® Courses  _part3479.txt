avities in the diaphysis cartilage. Blood vessels invade the cavities, and
osteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone. Osteoclasts then break down some of the
spongy bone to create a marrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis. Dense, irregular connective tissue forms
a sheath (periosteum) around the bones. The periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and
ligaments. The bone continues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide.
In the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify. Secondary ossification centers
form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone. Until
adolescence, hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), which is the region between the diaphysis and
epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones (Figu
