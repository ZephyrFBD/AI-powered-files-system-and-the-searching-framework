is exerted on it. Galileo thus interpreted friction as a force akin to ordinary pushes
and pulls.
To push an object across a table at constant speed requires a force from your
hand that can balance the force of friction (Fig. 4–3). When the object moves at
constant speed, your pushing force is equal in magnitude to the friction force; but
these two forces are in opposite directions, so the net force on the object (the vector
sum of the two forces) is zero. This is consistent with Galileo’s viewpoint, for the
object moves with constant velocity when no net force is exerted on it.
Upon this foundation laid by Galileo, Isaac Newton (Fig. 4–4) built his great
theory of motion. Newton’s analysis of motion is summarized in his famous
“three laws of motion.” In his great work, the Principia (published in 1687),
Newton readily acknowledged his debt to Galileo. In fact, Newton’s first law 
of motion is close to Galileo’s conclusions. It states that
Every object continues in its state of r
