 enable them to
more successfully elude predators. Similarly, some predators may have characteristics that enable them to more
successfully capture prey. The natural selection of characteristics that promote the most successful predators and the
most elusive prey leads to coevolution of predator and prey. In other cases, two species may evolve so that mutual
benefits increase. In general, coevolution is the evolution of one species in response to new adaptations that appear
in another species. Some important examples of coevolution follow:
1. Secondary compounds are toxic chemicals produced in plants that discourage would-be herbivores.
 
Tannins, commonly found in oaks, and nicotine, found in tobacco, are secondary compounds that are toxic to
herbivores. In many cases, metabolic adaptations have evolved in herbivores that allow them to tolerate these toxins.
For example, monarch butterflies eat milkweed plants whose toxins accumulate in the bodies of the butterflies and
serve to prote
