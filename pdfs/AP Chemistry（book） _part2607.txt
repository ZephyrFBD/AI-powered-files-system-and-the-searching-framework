nerally does moving from left to right across a period. 
 (Section 8.4) For example, the difference in acidity of the period 2 elements is 
CH4 6 NH3 V H2O 6 HF. Because the C ¬H bond is essentially nonpolar, CH4 shows 
no tendency to form H+ and CH3 
- ions. Although the N¬H bond is polar, NH3 has a 
nonbonding pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom that dominates its chemistry, so NH3 
acts as a base rather than an acid.
The periodic trends in the acid strengths of binary compounds of hydrogen and the 
nonmetals of periods 2 and 3 are summarized in Figure 16.19.
