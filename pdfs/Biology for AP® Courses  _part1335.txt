ll birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female,
in which they are hemizygous.
Human Sex-linked Disorders
Sex-linkage studies in Morganâ€™s laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding X-linked recessive disorders in
humans, which include red-green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia. Because human males need to inherit only
one recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must
inherit recessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. When they inherit one recessive
X-linked mutant allele and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected.
Carrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X
chromosomes. However, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait,
