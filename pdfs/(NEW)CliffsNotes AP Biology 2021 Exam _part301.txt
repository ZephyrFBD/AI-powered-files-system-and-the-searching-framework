lso true because the homologous chromosome would have
the same genes but with possibly different alleles. In this case, both chromosomes carry the same genes, but the
alleles are different (A and B on one chromosome and a and b on its homologue). Taking both chromosomes
together, you get the genotype AaBb, and thus answer choice D is true. Answer choice C is false because even
though the chromosomes separate during meiosis to produce gametes that are AB and ab, crossing over can take
place, producing some gametes that are Ab and aB.
16. C. Begin by drawing a horizontal line with about 30 tick marks. Since K and J have a crossover frequency of 3,
write the letters K and J on two marks 3 ticks apart, near the middle. Next, add the letter L in two positions,8units to
the right of K and 8 units to the left of K. At this point of the solution, both positions are possible. Next, add the
letter M 12 units to the right of J and, again, 12 units to the left of J. Both are possible. Last, use th
