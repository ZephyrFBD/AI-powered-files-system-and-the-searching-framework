APOPTOSIS—PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH
Cells that are infected, damaged, or simply have come to the end of their
life span die by apoptosis, a genetically programmed series of events that
result in cell death. During this process, the DNA, organelles, and other
cytoplasmic components are systematically chopped up. The parts are
packaged in vesicles that are engulfed by special scavenger cells.
Apoptosis relies on several different cell-signaling pathways and signals
from outside, and sometimes from inside, the cells.

Cells carry out apoptosis for several reasons:
During embryonic development, when cells or tissues are no longer
needed, they die and are engulfed by neighboring cells. A familiar
example is provided by the cells in the tail of the tadpole, which
undergo apoptosis during frog metamorphosis.
The cell has sustained too much genetic damage that could lead to
cancer. This is common for epith
