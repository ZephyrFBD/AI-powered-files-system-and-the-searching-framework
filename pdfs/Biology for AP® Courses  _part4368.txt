N is large, (K-N)/K come close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped.
Thus, population growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity K. This model also allows for the
population of a negative population growth, or a population decline. This occurs when the number of individuals in the
population exceeds the carrying capacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative).
A graph of this equation yields an S-shaped curve (Figure 36.9), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than
exponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there
are few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases.
Finally, growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.
Role of Intraspecific Competition
The logistic model assumes that ev
