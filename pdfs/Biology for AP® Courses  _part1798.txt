3.23 The student can use representations to describe mechanisms of the regulation of
gene expression.
Cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and
cells donâ€™t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell
through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin
B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.
For cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell
has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, includi
