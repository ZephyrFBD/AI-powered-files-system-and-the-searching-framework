SOLUTION
Analyze We need to assess the intermolecular forces in these sub-
stances and use that information to determine the relative boiling 
points.
Plan The boiling point depends in part on the attractive forces 
in each substance. We need to order these substances according 
to the relative strengths of the different kinds of intermolecular 
attractions.
Solve The attractive forces are stronger for ionic substances than 
for molecular ones, so BaCl2 should have the highest boiling 
point. The intermolecular force
