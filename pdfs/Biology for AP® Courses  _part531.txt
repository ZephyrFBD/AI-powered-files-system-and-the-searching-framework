2.11 The student is able to construct models that connect the movement of molecules across
membrane with membrane structure and function.
A cellâ€™s plasma membrane defines the cell, outlines its borders, and determines the nature of its interaction with its
environment (see Figure 5.2 for a summary). Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in
controlled quantities. The plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white
blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma
membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which
is vital f
