II) A uniform narrow tube 1.70 m long is open at both ends.
It resonates at two successive harmonics of frequencies
275 Hz and 330 Hz. What is (a) the fundamental frequency,
and (b) the speed of sound in the gas in the tube?
40. (II) A pipe in air at 23.0°C is to be designed to produce 
two successive harmonics at 280 Hz and 320 Hz. How long
must the pipe be, and is it open or closed?
T = 22°C,

44. (III) The human ear canal is approximately 2.5 cm long. It
is open to the outside and is closed at the other end by the
eardrum. Estimate the frequencies (in the audible range) of
the standing waves in the ear canal. What is the relationship
of your answer to the information in the graph of Fig. 12–6?

*45. (II) Approximately what are the intensities of the first two
overtones of a violin compared to the fundamental? How
many decibels softer than the fundamental are the first and
second overtones? (See Fig. 12–15.)
