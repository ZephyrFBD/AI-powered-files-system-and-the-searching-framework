absolute temperature is a straight line that passes through the origin. Thus, to a
good approximation, the v
volume of a fixed quantity of gas is directly proportional
to the absolute temperature w
when the pressure is kept constant. This is known as
Charles’s law, and is written
[constant P]
A third gas law, known as Gay-Lussac’s law, after Joseph Gay-Lussac
(1778–1850), states that at constant v
volume, the absolute pressure of a fixed quantity
of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature:
[constant V]
The laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac are not really laws in the sense
that we use this term today (precise, deep, wide-ranging validity). They are really
only approximations that are accurate for real gases only as long as the pressure
and density of the gas are not too high, and the gas is not too close to liquefaction
(condensation). The term law applied to these three relationships has become
traditional, however, so we have stuck with that usage.
