a.
Guard cells allow carbon dioxide to enter and
exit the plant. Stomata regulate the opening and
closing of guard cells. If the cells didn’t
function, photosynthesis and transpiration would
cease, which would interfere with the necessary
continuous flow of water upward from roots to
leaves.
b.
Stomata allow oxygen to enter and exit the plant.
Guard cells regulate the opening and closing of
stomata. If the cells didn’t function,
photosynthesis would continue but transpiration
would cease, which would interfere with the
necessary continuous flow of water upward from
roots to leaves.

Guard cells allow carbon dioxide to enter and
