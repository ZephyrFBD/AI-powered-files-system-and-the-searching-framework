when it reached point B, what must be the potential dif-
ference between A and B?
12. (II) What is the speed of an electron with kinetic energy
(a) 850 eV, and (b) 0.50 keV?
13. (II) What is the speed of a proton whose ke is 4.2 keV?
14. (II) An alpha particle (which is a helium nucleus,
) is emitted in a radioactive decay with
What is its speed?
15. (II) An electric field greater than about 
causes
air to break down (electrons are removed from the atoms
and then recombine, emitting light). See Section 17–2 and
Table 17–3. If you shuffle along a carpet and then reach for
a doorknob, a spark flies across a gap you estimate to be
1 mm between your finger and the doorknob. Estimate the
voltage between your finger and the doorknob. Why is no
harm done?
