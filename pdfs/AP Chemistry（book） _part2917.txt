increases rapidly, a process called eutrophication (Figure 18.19). The processes by which 
plants decay consumes O2, and without sufficient oxygen, the water cannot sustain ani-
mal life.
The most significant sources of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in water are 
domestic sewage (phosphate-containing detergents and nitrogen-containing body 
wastes), runoff from agricultural land (fertilizers contain both nitrogen and phospho-
rus), and runoff from livestock areas (animal wastes contain nitrogen).

accumulation of dead and decaying plant 
matter in a body of water uses up the 
water’s oxygen supply, making the water 
unsuitable for aquatic animals.
Give It Some Thought
Which two elements are largely responsible for fresh water eutrophication?
Water Purification: Desalination
Because of its high salt content, seawater is unfit for human consumption and for 
most of the uses to which we put water. In the United States, the salt content of 
mun
