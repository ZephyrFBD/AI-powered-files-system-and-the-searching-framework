auses a decrease in internal pressure, and air is drawn into the lungs
because the internal pressure is less than the external pressure.
(D) Spiracles, openings in the exoskeleton of the insects, connect to
tracheal tubes that lead to the hemocoels where the diffusion of
respiratory gases occurs. The respiratory surface is internal.
(D) The breathing rate is controlled by the medulla in the brain,
which is primarily sensitive to CO2 levels in the blood. The other
choices are incorrect.
(A) From the lungs, blood flows into the left atrium via the
pulmonary vein.
(A) The pacemaker of the heart is the sinoatrial node. From the
sinoatrial node, the impulse passes to the atrioventricular node, then
to the bundle of His.
(B) When the pH becomes more acidic, hemoglobin has less affinity
for oxygen, so the hemoglobin will drop off some oxygen at the
cells that have become slightly acidic due to an accumulation of
CO2 from cell respiration.
(C) Diffusion occurs in the thin-walled capillaries wh
