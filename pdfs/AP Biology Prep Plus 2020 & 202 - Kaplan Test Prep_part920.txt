tatic pressure and osmotic pressure. Filtration occurs
when the hydrostatic pressure is greater than the osmotic pressure, and
reabsorption occurs when the osmotic pressure is greater than the hydrostatic
pressure.

56. Increasing blood pressure is the body’s response to tissues not receiving
suﬀicient oxygen and nutrients. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) increases
the permeability of cell membranes. Which of the following best explains
how MSM aﬀects cell pressure and fluid exchange?
Questions 58–60
The following diagram presents a simplified version of the nitrogen cycle.
MSM increases blood pressure to deliver suﬀicient oxygen and
nutrients to tissues.
(A)
MSM decreases blood pressure to balance cell pressure and
promotes transport of oxygen and nutrie
