Laws of Probability
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P (A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
If A and B are independent, then P (A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
Hardy-Weinberg Equations
 p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
p = frequency of allele 1 in a population
q = frequency of allele 2 in a population

 p + q = 1
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a
data set
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points
Range = value obtained by subtracting the smallest observation
(sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum)
Water Potential (Ψ)
Ψ = Ψp + Ψs
Ψp = pressure potential
Ψp = solute potential
The water potential will be equal to the solute potential of a solution in an open
container, since the pressure potential
