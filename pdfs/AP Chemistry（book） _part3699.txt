CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
The second type of stereoisomerism listed in Figure 23.19 is optical isomerism. 
Optical isomers, called enantiomers, are mirror images that cannot be superimposed 
on each other. They bear the same resemblance to each other that your left hand bears 
to your right hand. If you look at your left hand in a mirror, the image is identical to your 
right hand (Figure 23.22). No matter how hard you try, however, you cannot superimpose 
your two hands on each other. An example of a complex that exhibits this type of isom-
erism is the 3Co(en)343 +  ion. Figure 23.22 shows the two enantiomers of this complex 
and their mirror-image relationship. Just as there is no way that we can twist or turn our 
right hand to make it look identical to our left, so also there is no way to rotate one of 
these
