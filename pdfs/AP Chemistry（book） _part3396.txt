radiotracers are further illustrated by 
positron emission tomography (PET). PET is used for clinical diagnosis of 
many diseases. In this method, compounds containing radionuclides 
that decay by positron emission are injected into a patient. These 
compounds are chosen to enable researchers to monitor blood ﬂow, 
oxygen and glucose metabolic rates, and other biological functions. 
Some of the most interesting work involves study of the brain, which 
depends on glucose for most of its energy. Changes in how this sugar 
is metabolized or used by the brain may signal a disease such as can-
cer, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, or schizophrenia.
The radionuclides that are most widely used in PET are 
 
carbon-11 1t1>2 = 20.4  min2, ﬂuorine-18 1t1>2 = 110  min2, oxy-
gen-15 1t1>2 = 2  min2, and nitrogen-13 1t1>2 = 10 min2. Glucose, 
for example, can be labeled with carbon@11. Because the half-lives of 
positron emitters are so short, they must be generated on site using a 
cyclotron and the
