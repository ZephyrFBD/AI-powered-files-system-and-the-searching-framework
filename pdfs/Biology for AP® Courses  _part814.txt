 acids), and the Krebs cycle, after Hans Krebs, who first identified the steps in the
pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.
Citric Acid Cycle
Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria. Almost
all of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase,
which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop:
The last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of
redox, dehydration, hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP,
and reduced forms of NADH and FADH2 (Figure 7.10). This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and
FADH2 produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen. If this transfer
does not occur, t
