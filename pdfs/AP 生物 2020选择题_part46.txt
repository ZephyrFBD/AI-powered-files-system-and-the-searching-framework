ge-induced warming of arctic
tundra reduces average snow cover that
lighter-colored arctic foxes rely on for 
camouflage. Darker-colored arctic foxes 
are better suited to the exposed moss and 
grass habitat. 
(D) House sparrows that lay
smaller-than-average clutches of eggs
produce fewer viable offspring, while 
larger-than-average clutches of eggs result 
in malnourished chicks that have a higher 
mortality rate. 
51. Researchers have identified a molecule produced
by 
 turbinata, a marine
invertebrate, from which the drug trabectedin is
produced. Soft-tissue tumors treated with
trabectedin rapidly decrease in size. In a
preliminary study, healthy cells and tumor cells
sampled from skin cancer patients treated with
trabectedin were collected, and several
characteristics of the cells were observed. The
observed results of the study are shown in the
table.
