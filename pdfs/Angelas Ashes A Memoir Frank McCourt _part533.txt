 Get your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till 
 
 yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace. 
 
 She finds a rag and ties it around Alphie’s bottom for fear he might 
 
 shit all over the pram.Then she looks at us and wants to know why we’re 
 
 standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. 
 
 I’m afraid she’ll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it’s all right,we have 
 
 our clothes, they’re on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, 
 
 she says, put some sugar and water in the child’s bottle. She tells me I 
 
  
  
 have to push Alphie through the streets, she can’t manage the pram with 
 
 that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides ’tis a 
 
 disgraceful-looking object she’d be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She 
 
 takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you 
 
 can hardly see Alphie at all.
