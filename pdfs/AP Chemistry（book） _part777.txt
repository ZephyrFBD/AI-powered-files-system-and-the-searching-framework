 kJ 
for the combustion of 1 mol of propane. In part (a) of 
this exercise we determined that ∆H° = -3267 kJ for the 
combustion of 1 mol benzene. To determine the heat of 
combustion per gram of each substance, we use the molar 
masses to convert moles to grams:
 C3H81g2: 1-2220 kJ>mol211 mol>44.1 g2 = -50.3 kJ>g 
 C6H61l2: 1-3267 kJ>mol211 mol>78.1 g2 = -41.8 kJ>g
Comment Both propane and benzene are hydrocarbons. As a rule, 
the energy obtained from the combustion of a gram of hydrocar-
bon is between 40 and 50 kJ.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction
2 H2O21l2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2 + O21g2
using enthalpies of formation:
∆Hf°3H2O21l24 = -187.8 kJ>mol ∆Hf°3H2O1l24 = -285.8 kJ>mol
(a) -88.0 kJ 
(b) -196.0 kJ 
(c) +88.0 kJ 
(d) +196.0 kJ

▶Practice Exercise 2
Use Table 5.3 to calculate the enthalpy change for the com-
bustion of 1 mol of ethanol:
