In discussions that follow, the term rate means instanta-
neous rate unless indicated otherwise. The instantaneous rate at 
t = 0 is called the initial rate of the reaction. To understand the 
difference between average and instantaneous rates, imagine you 
have just driven 98 mi in 2.0 h. Your average speed for the trip is 
49 mi>hr, but your instantaneous speed at any moment during 
the trip is the speedometer reading at that moment.
Go Figure
Does the instantaneous rate increase, decrease, or remain 
the same as the reaction proceeds?
