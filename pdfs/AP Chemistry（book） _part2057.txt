Mass Percentage, ppm, and ppb
One of the simplest quantitative expressions of concentration is the mass percentage 
of a component in a solution, given by
 
Mass % of component =
mass of component in soln
total mass of soln
* 100 
[13.5]
Because percent means “per hundred,” a solution of hydrochloric acid that is 36% HCl by 
mass contains 36 g of HCl for each 100 g of solution.
We often express the concentration of very dilute solutions in parts per million 
(ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). These quantities are similar to mass percentage but 
use 106 (a million) or 109 (a billion), respectively, in place of 100, as a multiplier for the 
ratio of the mass of solute to the mass of solution. Thus, parts per million is defined as
 
ppm of component =
mass of component in soln
total mass of soln
* 106 
[13.6]
A solution whose solute concentration is 1 ppm contains 1 g of solute for each million 
11062 grams of solution or, equivalently, 1 mg of solute per kilogram
