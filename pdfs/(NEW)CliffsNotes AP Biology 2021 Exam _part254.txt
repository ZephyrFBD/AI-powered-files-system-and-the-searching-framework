fers to the inheritance of two dominant alleles (TT). In this condition, the dominant
trait is expressed. In the homozygous recessive condition, two recessive alleles are inherited (tt) and the recessive
trait is expressed. Heterozygous refers to the condition where the two inherited alleles are different (Ttâ€”it is normal
convention to write a pair of alleles with the dominant allele first). In this condition, only the dominant allele is
expressed.
7. The phenotype is the expression of an allele. Tall stems, blue eyes, and brown hair each represent the phenotype
of their respective alleles. On the other hand, the genotype represents the actual alleles. For example, TT describes
the genotype for the homozygous dominant condition. If T represents the allele for tall stems and t is the allele for
dwarf stems, the genotype Tt would express the phenotype of tall stems. To help you remember their meanings,
think gene s for genotype and ph ysical trait for phenotype (although phenotypes might
