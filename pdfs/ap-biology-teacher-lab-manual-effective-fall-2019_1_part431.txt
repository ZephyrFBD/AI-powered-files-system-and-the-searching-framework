Cell division is tightly controlled by complexes made of several specific proteins. 
These complexes contain enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which turn 
on or off the various processes that take place in cell division. CDK partners with a 
family of proteins called cyclins. One such complex is mitosis-promoting factor (MPF), 
sometimes called maturation-promoting factor, which contains cyclin A or B and cyclinÂ­
dependent kinase (CDK). (See Figure 2a.) CDK is activated when it is bound to cyclin, 
interacting with various other proteins that, in this case, allow the cell to proceed from 
G2 into mitosis. The levels of cyclin change during the cell cycle (Figure 2b). In most 
cases, cytokinesis follows mitosis.
