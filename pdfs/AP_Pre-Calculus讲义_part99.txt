alled the pole (or origin) 
and draw from O a ray (half-line) called the polar axis. 
 
Then each point P can be assigned polar coordinates P(r,  ), where 
r is the distance from O to P 
 is the angle

between the polar axis and the segment 
 
We use the convention that  is positive if measured in a counterclockwise direction from 
the polar axis or negative if measured in a clockwise direction. 
If r is negative, then P(r,  ) is defined to be the point that lies |r| units from the pole in the 
direction opposite to that given by  .

3.11.2 Relationship Between Polar and Rectangular Coordinates 
The connection between the two systems is illustrated in the figure below, where the polar 
axis coincides with the positive x-axis 
 
The formulas in the box are obtained from the figure using the definitions of the 
trigonometric functions and the Pythagorean Theorem.
