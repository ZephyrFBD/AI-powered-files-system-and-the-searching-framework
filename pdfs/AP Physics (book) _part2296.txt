nd out from the coil. What
would an observer watching the galvanometer see?
(a) No change (pointer stays on zero): without a battery there is no current to
detect.
(b) A small current flows while the magnet is inside the coil of wire.
(c) A current spike as the magnet enters the coil, and then nothing.
(d) A current spike as the magnet enters the coil, and then a steady small current.
(e) A current spike as the magnet enters the coil, then nothing (pointer at zero),
then a current spike in the opposite direction as the magnet exits the coil.

n Chapter 20, we discussed two ways in which electricity and magnetism are
related: (1) an electric current produces a magnetic field; and (2) a magnetic
field exerts a force on an electric current or on a moving electric charge. These
discoveries were made in 1820â€“1821. Scientists then began to wonder: if electric
currents produce a magnetic field, is it possible that a magnetic field can produce
an electric current? Ten years later the American
