the applicability of the species-area relationship when
estimating the loss of species. This work argues that the species-area relationship leads to an overestimate of extinction
rates. A better relationship to use may be the endemics-area relationship. Using this method would bring estimates down to
around 500 E/MSY in the coming century. Note that this value is still 500 times the background rate.
