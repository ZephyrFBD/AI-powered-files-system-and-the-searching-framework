 perfectly valid. But to avoid confusion, it is very important
to remember that the “action” force and the “reaction” force are acting on different
objects.
As evidence for the validity of Newton’s third law, look at your hand when
you push against the edge of a desk, Fig. 4–8. Your hand’s shape is distorted, clear
evidence that a force is being exerted on it. You can see the edge of the desk press-
ing into your hand. You can even feel the desk exerting a force on your hand;
it hurts! The harder you push against the desk, the harder the desk pushes back 
on your hand. (You only feel forces exerted on you; when you exert a force on
another object, what you feel is that object pushing back on you.)
