People who go fishing wear Polaroids to eliminate reflected glare from the
surface of a lake or stream and thus see beneath the water more clearly (Fig.24–47).
The amount of polarization in the reflected beam depends on the angle,
varying from no polarization at normal incidence to 100% polarization at an angle
known as the polarizing angle
† This angle is related to the index of refraction
of the two materials on either side of the boundary by the equation
(24;6a)
where 
is the index of refraction of the material in which the incident beam is
traveling, and 
is that of the medium beyond the reflecting boundary. If the
beam is traveling in air,
and Eq. 24–6a becomes
(24;6b)
The polarizing angle 
is also called Brewster’s angle, and Eqs. 24–6 Brewster’s
law, after the Scottish physicist David Brewster (1781–1868), who worked it out
experimentally in 1812. Equations 24–6 can be derived from the electromagnetic
wave theory of light. It is interesting th
