 A ¡  products is first order, the rate law is:
 
Rate = - 
∆3A4
∆t
= k3A4 
This form of a rate law, which expresses how rate depends on concentration, is called the 
differential rate law. Using the operation from calculus called integration, we see that this 
relationship can be transformed into an equation known as the integrated rate law for a 
first-order reaction that relates the initial concentration of A, 3A40, to its concentration 
at any other time t, 3A4t:
 
ln3A4t - ln3A40 = -kt or ln 
3A4t
3A40
= -kt 
[14.12]
The function “ln” in Equation 14.12 is the natural logarithm (Appendix A.2). Equa-
tion 14.12 can also be rearranged to
 
ln3A4t = -kt + ln3A40 
[14.13]
Check A good way to check our rate law is to use the concentra-
tions in experiment 2 or 3 and see if we can correctly calculate the 
rate. Using data from experiment 3, we have
Rate = k3A42 = 14.0 * 10-3 M-1 s-1210.200 M22
= 1.6 * 10-4 M>s
Thus, the rate law correctly reproduces the data, giving both the 
correct num
