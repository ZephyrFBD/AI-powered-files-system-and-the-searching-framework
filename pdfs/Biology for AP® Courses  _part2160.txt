ll fitness
(reproductive success) compared to the rest of the population. In other words, natural selection favors the most adaptive
variation for a given environment. If the fit phenotypes are evolving in a stable environment, natural selection results in
stabilizing selection, resulting in an overall decrease in the population’s variation. However, if environmental conditions
change, directional selection shifts a population’s variance toward a new and more favorable phenotype. Diversifying
selection results in increased variance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes.
Sexual selection results when one sex has more reproductive success than the other; as a result, males and females
experience different selective pressures, which often lead to distinct phenotypic differences, or sexual dimorphisms,
between the two. For example, male birds often exhibit more colorful plumage than female birds of the same species.
What is most important to recognize is that there is no perfect
