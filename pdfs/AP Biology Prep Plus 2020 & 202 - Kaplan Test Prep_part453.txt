ides at all and at what rate. Certain hormones
and other chemicals need to be present for a cell to divide. Cell division
can be controlled in tissue cultures by inhibiting protein synthesis or
aï¬€ecting nutrient availability. Cell division is reduced by crowding
through contact inhibition.
PHASES OF MITOSIS
Among the key aspects of mitosis are the following:
Chromosomes shorten and thicken in the nucleus, and the
nuclear membrane dissolves.
The mitotic spindle of microtubules is formed.
The contractile ring of actin develops around the center of the
cell.
For mitosis to work, a single pair of centrioles will copy themselves
during the S phase, and the two pairs will move to opposite poles of the
cell. These pairs of centrioles form the foundation for centrosomes,
microtubule organizing centers that will shoot linked tubulin proteins
across the cell as mitosis begins. Keep in mind, however, that the
centrioles themselves are not necessary for microtubules to form from
the centrosome are
