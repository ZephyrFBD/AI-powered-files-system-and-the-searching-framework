ganisms often depends on their ability to respond to changes in their environment. Organisms can
respond to environmental changes with behavioral or physiological mechanisms.
A change in the environment that triggers a response is called a stimulus. One example of a stimulus that can
trigger a response is change in day length. Some birds respond to changes in day length by migrating, a behavioral
response. Other animals may respond to changes in day length by slowing their metabolism to conserve energy, a
physiological response.
Some stimuli are communicated among organisms. Organisms send signals to each other in response to changes
in their environment. These signals can trigger changes in the behavior of other organisms. This communication
among organisms can occur through different types of signals:
■Audible signals—Birds use audible signals to send warnings to other birds and to attract mates. Some
primates use vocalizations to assert dominance or to warn of the presence of predat
