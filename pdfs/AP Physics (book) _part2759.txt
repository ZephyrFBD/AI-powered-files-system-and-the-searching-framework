ou understand the double-slit experiment
and interference.
2. Discuss the similarities, and differences, of double-slit inter-
ference and single-slit diffraction.
3. Describe why the various colors of visible light appear as
they do in Fig. 24–16, where red is at the top and violet at
the bottom, and in Fig. 24–26, where violet is closest to 
the central maximum and red is farthest from the central
maximum.
4. When can we use geometric optics as in Chapter 23, and
when do we need to use the more complicated wave model
of light discussed in Chapter 24? In particular, what are
the physical characteristics that matter in making this
decision?
5. A parallel beam of light containing two wavelengths,
420 nm and 650 nm, enters a borate flint glass equilateral
prism (Fig. 24–63). (a) What is the angle between the two
beams leaving the prism? (b) Repeat part (a) for a diffraction
grating with 
(c) Discuss two advantages of a
diffraction grating, including one that you see from your
results.
