ly from viruses, by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules on
the surface of infected cells. MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells, thus they are scarce on
red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated. The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins
from the infectious agents within the cell to T-cells; healthy cells will be ignored, while “non-self” or foreign proteins will
be attacked by the immune system. MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens (“non-self proteins”)
and on lymphocytes. MHC II molecules interact with helper T-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response, which
may include the inflammatory response.

Figure 33.6 Lymphocytes, such as NK cells, are characterized by their large nuclei that actively absorb Wright stain
and therefore appear dark colored under a microscope.
An infected cell (or a tumor cell) is usually
