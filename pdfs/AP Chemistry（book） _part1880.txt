3. The number of molecular orbitals in a molecule equals the number of atomic orbit-
als that combine to form molecular orbitals.
4. Adding electrons to a bonding molecular orbital strengthens bonding, while adding 
electrons to antibonding molecular orbitals weakens bonding.
The electronic structures of crystalline solids and small molecules have similari-
ties as well as differences. To illustrate, consider how the molecular orbital diagram for 
a chain of lithium atoms changes as we increase the length of the chain (Figure 12.22).
