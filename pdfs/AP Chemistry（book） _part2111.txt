r than dispersing in the water.
Hydrophobic colloids can also be stabilized by hydrophilic groups on their surfaces. 
Oil drops are hydrophobic, for example, and they do not remain suspended in water. 
Instead, they aggregate, forming an oil slick on the water surface. Sodium stearate (Fig-
ure 13.28), or any similar substance having one end that is hydrophilic (either polar or 
charged) and one end that is hydrophobic (nonpolar), will stabilize a suspension of oil in 
water. Stabilization results from the interaction of the hydrophobic ends of the stearate 
ions with the oil drops and the hydrophilic ends with the water.
Colloid stabilization has an interesting application in the human digestive sys-
tem. When fats in our diet reach the small intestine, a hormone causes the gallblad-
der to excrete a fluid called bile. Among the components of bile are compounds that 
have chemical structures similar to sodium stearate; that is, they have a hydrophilic 
(polar) end and a hydrophobic (n
