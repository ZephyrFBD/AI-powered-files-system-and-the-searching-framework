ylene glycol and 0.15 mol KBr in 150 g H2O.
 13.75  How many grams of ethylene glycol 1C2H6O22 must be 
added to 1.00 kg of water to produce a solution that freezes 
at -5.00 °C?
 13.76  What is the freezing point of an aqueous solution that boils 
at 105.0 °C?
 13.77  What is the osmotic pressure formed by dissolving 44.2 mg 
of aspirin 1C9H8O42 in 0.358 L of water at 25 °C?
 13.78  Seawater contains 34 g of salts for every liter of solution. 
Assuming that the solute consists entirely of NaCl (in fact, 
over 90% of the salt is indeed NaCl), calculate the osmotic 
pressure of seawater at 20 °C.
 13.79  Adrenaline is the hormone that triggers the release of extra 
glucose molecules in times of stress or emergency. A solu-
tion of 0.64 g of adrenaline in 36.0 g of CCl4 elevates the 
boiling point by 0.49 °C. Calculate the approximate molar 
mass of adrenaline from this data.

make detergents. A solut
