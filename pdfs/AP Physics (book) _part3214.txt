With what maximum precision can its position be determined?
60. An atomic spectrum contains a line with a wavelength
centered at 488 nm. Careful measurements show the line is
really spread out between 487 and 489 nm. Estimate the
lifetime of the excited state that produced this line.
61. An electron and a proton, each initially at rest, are acceler-
ated across the same voltage. Assuming that the uncertainty
in their position is given by their de Broglie wavelength,
find the ratio of the uncertainty in their momentum.
62. If the principal quantum number n were limited to the range
from 1 to 6, how many elements would we find in nature?
63. If your de Broglie wavelength were 0.50 m, h
