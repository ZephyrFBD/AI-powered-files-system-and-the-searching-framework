41. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS1) is a rare hereditary
disorder that leads to a predisposition to cancer. This
hereditary disorder is linked to mutations in the tumor
suppressor gene encoding the transcription factor p53. p53
acts at the G1 checkpoint. If damaged DNA is detected,
p53 halts the cell cycle. As p53 levels rise, the production
of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cell cycle.
A variant of Li-Fraumeni, called LFS2, is thought to occur
due to a mutation of the CHK2 gene, which is also a tumor
suppressor gene. CHK2 regulates the action of p53. Which
of the following cascades is most likely to occur in a
normal cell that does not contain the LFS mutation?
a.
