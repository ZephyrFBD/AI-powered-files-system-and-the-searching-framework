 of the upper arm, the radius and ulna of the forearm, eight bones
of the carpus, five bones of the metacarpus, and 14 bones of the phalanges.
An articulation is any place at which two bones are joined. The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb
and the only bone of the arm. It articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow. The forearm
extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones: the ulna and the radius. The radius is located along the
lateral (thumb) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow. The ulna is located on the medial aspect
(pinky-finger side) of the forearm. It is longer than the radius. The ulna articulates with the humerus at the elbow. The radius
and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other, which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation
of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb. The hand includes the eight bones of the carpus (wris
