es are
viruses that infect bacteria. They have two different modes of replication: the lytic cycle, where the virus replicates and
bursts out of the bacteria, and the lysogenic cycle, which involves the incorporation of the viral genome into the bacterial
host genome. Animal viruses cause a variety of infections, with some causing chronic symptoms (hepatitis C), some
intermittent symptoms (latent viruses such a herpes simplex virus 1), and others that cause very few symptoms, if any
(human herpesviruses 6 and 7). Oncogenic viruses in animals have the ability to cause cancer by interfering with the
regulation of the host cell cycle. Viruses of plants are responsible for significant economic damage in both agriculture and
plants used for ornamentation.
21.3 Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections
Viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. Many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which
stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing ma
