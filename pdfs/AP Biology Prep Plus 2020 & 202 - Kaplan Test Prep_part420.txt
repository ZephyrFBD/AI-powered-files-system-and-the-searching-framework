Photosynthesis is the energy foundation for almost all living
systems. In addition, photosynthesis provides almost all of the
oxygen present in the Earth’s atmosphere.
1.
All photosynthetic organisms use chloroplasts and
mitochondria to perform photosynthesis and cellular
respiration. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are
essentially reverse operations of each other.
2.
Photosynthesis has two main parts—the light cycle and the
dark cycle (the latter is usually called the Calvin or Calvin-
Benson cycle). Light reactions produce energy and dark
reactions make sugars. The light reactions occur in the interior
of the thylakoid, while the Calvin-Benson cycle occurs in the
stroma.
3.
Cellular respiration is an eﬀicient catabolic pathway and yields
ATP. Cellular respiration is an aerobic process. The metabolic
reactions of respiration occur in t
