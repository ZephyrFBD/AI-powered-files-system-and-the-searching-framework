12–1 Characteristics of Sound
1. (I) A hiker determines the length of a lake by listening for
the echo of her shout reflected by a cliff at the far end of the
lake. She hears the echo 2.5 s after shouting. Estimate the
length of the lake.
2. (I) A sailor strikes the side of his ship just below the water-
line. He hears the echo of the sound reflected from the ocean
floor directly below 2.0 s later. How deep is the ocean at this
point? Assume the speed of sound in sea water is 
(Table 12–1) and does not vary significantly with depth.
3. (I) (a) Calculate the wavelengths in air at 20°C for sounds in
the maximum range of human hearing, 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.
(b) What is the wavelength of an 18-MHz ultrasonic wave?
4. (II) On a warm summer day (31°C), it takes 4.80 s for an
echo to return from a cliff across a lake. On a winter day, it
takes 5.20 s. What is the temperature on the winter day?
5. (II) An ocean fishing boat is drifting just above a
