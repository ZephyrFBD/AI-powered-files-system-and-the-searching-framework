rchers studied ligand-receptor interactions and summarized
their data in the diagram below.

Chemical Principles Underlying RTK Activation, and

Based on the diagram, which of the following statements best
describes the activation of an RTK?
Ligands can bind either to monomers or dimers and, in each
case, fully activate tyrosine kinase phosphorylation.
(A)
Ligands can bind to monomers or dimers, but only the
ligand-dimer complex can be phosphorylated.
(B)
Only dimers bound to the ligand undergo extensive
phosphorylation, initiating the signaling cascade.
(C)
Monomers can form dimers without the ligand bound, can
become phosphorylated, and can start the signaling cascade
in the absence of a signal.
(D)
