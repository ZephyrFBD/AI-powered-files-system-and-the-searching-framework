(c) The structure with two double bonds minimizes formal charges 
and is probably the main contributor. (d) The N ¬ N distances will 
be equal and have the approximate length of a N ¬ N double bond, 
1.24 Å.

(c) Chlorine is less electronegative and less electron withdrawing 
than ﬂuorine. The B—N bond in NH3BCl3 is less polar than the B—N 
bond in NH3BF3.
