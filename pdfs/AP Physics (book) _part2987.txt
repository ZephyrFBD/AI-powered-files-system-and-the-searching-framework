muons pass through your body. If a muon is created 30 km
above the Earth’s surface, what minimum speed and kinetic
energy must the muon have in order to hit Earth’s surface?
A muon’s mean lifetime (at rest) is 
and its mass is
6. As a rough rule, anything traveling faster than about 0.1c
is called relativistic—that is, special relativity is a significant
effect. Determine the speed of an electron in a hydrogen
atom (radius 
) and state whether or not it 
is relativistic. (Treat the electron as though it were in a
circular orbit around the proton. See hint for Problem 46.)
