49. It has been accepted that life on the Earth started out as
single celled, simple organisms, which then evolved into
complex organisms. How did evolution proceed to
produce such a wide variety of living organisms from a
simple ancestor?
a.
Prokaryotes produced the fungi, then the protists
which then branches to plants and animals.

Protists evolved first, then the prokaryotes,
which branched into the fungi, plants, and
