70. (II) A uniform horizontal rod of mass M and length rotates
with angular velocity 
about a vertical axis through its
center. Attached to each end of the rod is a small mass m.
Determine the angular momentum of the system about the
axis.
71. (II) Suppose our Sun eventually collapses into a white dwarf,
losing about half its mass in the process, and winding up
with a radius 1.0% of its existing radius. Assuming the lost
mass carries away no angular momentum, (a) what would the
Sunâ€™s new rotation rate be? Take the
