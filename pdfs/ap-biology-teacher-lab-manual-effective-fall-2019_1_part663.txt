•  ENE-1.N: Explain how changes in energy availability affect populations and  
ecosystems.   
•  ENE-1.O: Explain how the activities of autotrophs and heterotrophs enable the flow 
of energy within an ecosystem. 
•  SYI-3.A: Explain the connection between variation in the number and types of 
molecules within cells to the ability of the organism to survive and/or reproduce in 
different environments. 
■ General Safety Precautions 
•  Cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) are listed as a pest species by the USDA. 
Therefore, no butterflies or larvae raised in the laboratory should be released to the 
wild. 
•  Euthanize the butterflies or larvae by freezing them when your investigation is 
complete. The plants and soil can simply be discarded. 
•  Disease outbreaks are common in cultured populations of organisms. Although 
the diseases associated with the organisms in this investigation are not dangerous 
to humans, it is important to maintain cleanliness in the laborator
