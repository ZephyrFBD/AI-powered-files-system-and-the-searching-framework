arge, and this charge draws it to the positively charged end of a water
molecule. Since a phospholipid has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region, it is an amphipathic
molecule. One side of a phospholipid loves to hang out with water, and the other side hates to.
Thus, the two fatty acid chains orient themselves away from water, while the phosphate portion orients itself toward
the water. Keep these properties in mind. Weâ€™ll see later how this orientation of phospholipids in water relates to the
structure and function of cell membranes.
Cholesterol
Cholesterol is another important type of lipid. Cholesterol is a four-ringed molecule that is found here and there in
membranes. It generally increases membrane fluidity, except at very high temperatures when it helps to hold things
together instead. Cholesterol is also important for making certain types of hormones and for making vitamin D. Here
are some examples:
Nucleic Acids
The fourth class of organic compounds is the nuclei
