The components of a given vector depend on the choice of coordinate axes.
You can often reduce the work involved in adding vectors by a good choice of
axes—for example, by choosing one of the axes to be in the same direction as one
of the vectors. Then that vector will have only one nonzero component.
Mail carrier’s displacement. A rural mail carrier leaves the
post office and drives 22.0 km in a northerly direction. She then drives in a direc-
tion 60.0° south of east for 47.0 km (Fig. 3–15a). What is her displacement from
the post office?
