t’s immune system will recognize the proteins on the incompatible organ as foreign and will
attack these foreign proteins. The attack will cause the organ to be rejected.
Plasma cells and CTLs are collectively called effector cells: they represent differentiated versions of their naïve
counterparts, and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells.
Mucosal Surfaces and Immune Tolerance
The innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system (affecting the
whole body), which is distinct from the mucosal immune system. Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue, which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive
components. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), illustrated in Figure 33.15, is a collection of lymphatic tissue
that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functio
