FIGURE 16–44 Electric field lines
passing through a closed surface.
The surface is divided up into many
tiny areas,
and so on,
of which only two are shown.
¢A1 , ¢A2, p ,
Charged spherical conducting shell. A thin spherical
shell of radius 
possesses a total net charge Q that is uniformly distributed on it,
Fig. 16–45. Determine the electric field at points (a) outside the shell, and 
(b) inside the shell.
APPROACH Because the charge is distributed symmetrically, the electric field
must be symmetric. Thus the field outside the shell must be directed radially
outward (inward if
) and must depend only on r.
SOLUTION (a) We choose
