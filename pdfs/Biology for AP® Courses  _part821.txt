Connection for APÂ® Courses
The electron transport chain (ETC) is the stage of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron acceptor of
the electrons removed during glucose metabolism in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. The ETC is located in membrane of
the mitochondrial cristae, an area with many folds that increase the surface area available for chemical reactions. Electrons
carried by NADH and FADH2 are delivered to electron acceptor proteins embedded in the membrane as they move toward
the final electron acceptor, O2, forming water. The electrons pass through a series of redox reactions, using free energy at
three points to transport hydrogen ions across the membrane. This process contributes to the formation of the H+ gradient
used in chemiosmosis. As the protons are driven down their concentration gradient through ATP synthase, ATP is generated
from AD
