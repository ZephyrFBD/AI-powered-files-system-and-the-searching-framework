ng the five-carbon chain, 
the name tells us that the ethyl group is attached to C3 and the 
methyl group is attached to C2.
Solve We begin by writing five C atoms attached by single bonds. 
These represent the backbone of the parent pentane chain:
C ¬C ¬ C ¬C ¬ C
We next place a methyl group on the second C and an ethyl 
group on the third C of the chain. We then add hydrogens to all 
the other C atoms to make four bonds to each carbon:
CH3
CH2
CH2CH3
CH3
CH
CH
CH3
The formula can be written more concisely as
CH3CH1CH32CH1C2H52CH2CH3
where the branching alkyl groups are indicated in parentheses.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
How many hydrogen atoms are in 2,2-dimethylhexane?
(a) 6 (b) 8 (c) 16 (d) 18 (e) 20
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the condensed structural formula for  
2,3-dimethylhexane.
Give It Some Thought
Are the C ¬ C bonds cyclopropane weaker than those in cyclohexane?
Reactions of Alkanes
Because they contain only C ¬C and C ¬H bonds, most alkanes are relatively unreac-
tive. At
