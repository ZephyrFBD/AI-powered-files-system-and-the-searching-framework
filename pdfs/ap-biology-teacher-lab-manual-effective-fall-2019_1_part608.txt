garose powder (a gelatinlike substance 
purified from seaweed) in a current-carrying buffer. The gel solidifies around a comb 
placed at one end, forming wells into which you can load DNA fragments. When an 
electrical current is passed through the gel, the RFLPs (fragments) migrate from one 
pole to the other. Gel electrophoresis can separate DNA fragments from about 200 to 
50,000 base pairs (bp). 
•  Why do DNA fragments migrate through the gel from the negatively charged pole to 
the positively charged pole? 
The general process of gel electrophoresis is illustrated in Figure 2.

Learning to Use Gel Electrophoresis 
To determine whose blood was on the classroom floor crime scene, you will need 
to be familiar with the techniques involved in creating genetic profiles using gel 
electrophoresis. The steps in the general procedure are described below
