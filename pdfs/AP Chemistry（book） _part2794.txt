OH-1aq2 is added? What 
concentration of OH-1aq2 is necessary to begin the precipi-
tation of each cation? 3Ksp = 1.8 * 10-11 for Mg1OH22, and 
Ksp = 4.8 * 10-20 for Cu1OH22.4

Qualitative Analysis  
for Metallic Elements
In this final section, we look at how solubility equilibria and complex-ion formation can 
be used to detect the presence of particular metal ions in solution. Before the development 
of modern analytical instrumentation, it was necessary to analyze mixtures of metals in

If a solution contained a mixture of Cu2 +1aq2 and Zn2 +1aq2 ions, 
would this separation scheme work? After which step would the 
first precipitate be observed?
