explanation for this behavior?
(a) Potassium salts are always soluble in water.
(b) The entropy of mixing must be unfavorable.
(c) The enthalpy of mixing must be small compared to the 
enthalpies for breaking up water–water interactions and 
K–Br ionic interactions.
(d) KBr has a high molar mass compared to other salts like 
NaCl.
Saturated Solutions; Factors Affecting Solubility 
(Sections 13.2 and 13.3)
 13.23  The solubility of Cr1NO323 # 9 H2O in water is 208 g per 100 g 
of water at 15 °C. A solution of Cr1NO323 # 9 H2O in water at 
35 °C is formed by dissolving 324 g in 100 g of water. When 
this solution is slowly cooled to 15 °C, no precipitate forms.
(a) Is the solution that has cooled down to 15 °C unsaturated, 
saturated, or supersaturated? (b) You take a metal spatula 
and scratch the side of the glass vessel that contains this 
cooled solution, and crystals start to appear. What has just 
happened? (c) At equilibrium, what mass of crystals do you 
expect to form?
