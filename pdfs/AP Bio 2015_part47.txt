ich of the following presents the most likely 
evolutionary explanation for the behaviors 
described? 
(A) The warning bark changes the behavior of the 
related prairie dogs nearby, allowing the 
prairie dogâ€™s family to have increased 
survival and reproductive success. 
(B) The barking prairie dog chooses to warn 
other prairie dogs, leading 
 to more prairie 
dogs living above ground. 
 
(C) The barking prairie dog is alerting unrelated 
prairie dogs to the predator, so it is not 
 
giving any advantage to its own relatives. 
(D) The failure of the individual to bark when 
 
surrounded by unrelated prairie dogs 
ensures survival of the individual.

 One model of a sustainable fisheries practice is 
for individual fish to be removed from a natural 
population at a rate equal to the highest possible 
growth rate of an ideal population. The graph 
above represents a population of bluefin tuna 
living along the Atlantic coast. At which labeled 
point in the graph is the population gr
