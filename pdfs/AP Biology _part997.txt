Which statement below best explains the results of this experiment
and provides the correct reasoning for why those results occurred?
The rate of photosynthesis is highest when a tube is exposed to
light in the 550 nm range because that wavelength of light
contains the greatest amount of energy.
The rate of photosynthesis is highest when a tube is exposed to
light in the 550 nm range because that wavelength of light
contains the least amount of energy.
The rate of photosynthesis is highest when a tube is exposed to
combined light in the 650 nm and 700 nm ranges because the
combination of the two wavelengths of light contains the
greatest amount of energy.
The rate of photosynthesis is highest when a tube is exposed to
combined light in the 650 nm and 700 nm ranges because there
are two photosystems in chloroplasts, each absorbing a
different wavel
