Shapes and polarity of polyatomic Molecules 
(Section 9.3)
 9.35 What is the distinction between a bond dipole and a molecu-
lar dipole moment?
 9.36  Consider a molecule with formula AX3. Supposing the A ¬ X 
bond is polar, how would you expect the dipole moment of 
the AX3 molecule to change as the X¬A ¬ X bond angle in-
creases from 100° to 120°?

 9.37 (a) Does SCl2 have a dipole moment? If so, in which direction 
does the net dipole point? (b) Does BeCl2 have a dipole mo-
ment? If so, in which direction does the net dipole point?
 9.38 (a) The PH3 molecule is polar. Does this offer experimental 
proof that the molecule cannot be planar? Explain. (b) It 
turns out that ozone, O3, has a small dipole moment. How is 
this possible, given that all the atoms are the sam
