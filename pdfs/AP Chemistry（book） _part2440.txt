CHAPTER 15 Chemical Equilibrium
When the temperature of a system at equilibrium is increased, the system  
reacts as if we added a reactant to an endothermic reaction or a product to an  
exothermic reaction. The equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes  
the excess reactant (or product), namely heat.
Give It Some Thought
Is vaporization an exothermic or endothermic process? Based on Le Châtelier’s 
principle, would you predict the vapor pressure of a gas will increase or decrease as 
the temperature increases?
In an endothermic reaction, such as Equation 15.25, heat is absorbed as reactants are 
converted to products. Th
