17. During aerobic cellular respiration, oxygen gas is 
consumed at the same rate as carbon dioxide gas 
is produced. In order to provide accurate 
volumetric measurements of oxygen gas 
consumption, the experimental setup should 
include which of the following? 
(A) A substance that removes carbon dioxide gas 
(B) A plant to produce oxygen 
(C) A glucose reserve 
(D) A valve to release excess water 
 
18. According to the data, the mice at 10∞C 
demonstrated greater oxygen consumption per 
gram of tissue than did the mice at 25∞C. This is  
most likely explained by which of the following 
statements? 
(A) The mice at 10∞C had a higher rate of ATP 
production than the mice at 25∞C. 
(B) The mice at 10∞C
