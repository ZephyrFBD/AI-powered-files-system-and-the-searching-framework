sponse. Once released from the adrenal gland into the
bloodstream, cortisol diffuses from blood plasma into saliva, enabling the collection of measurable
amounts of hormones from saliva samples. The table below gives cortisol concentrations in saliva
samples taken from two female Asian elephants over a six-day period during which the animals were
introduced to each other at a zoo. The baseline (normal) salivary cortisol level in elephants is 4â€“5
nanomoles per liter. Elephant 1 had previously lived alone and was flown in from Africa on Day 1 prior
to the introduction. The elephants were introduced to each other on Day 3.

19. Which selective advantage would these changing cortisol levels give this species of elephants?
(A) When new elephants meet in the wild, they will be less likely to fight and more likely to cooperate
