The number of decays per second, or decay rate R, is the magnitude of 
and is also called the activity of the sample. The magnitude (always positive) of a
quantity is often indicated using vertical lines. The magnitude of 
is written
and it is proportional to N (see Eq. 30–3b). So it too decreases expo-
nentially in time at the same rate (Fig. 30–10b). The activity of a pure sample at
time is 
(30;5)
where
is the activity at 
Equation 30–5 is also referred to as the radioactive decay law (as is
Eq. 30–4).
Half-Life
The rate of decay of any isotope is often specified by giving its “half-life” rather
than the decay constant 
The half-life of an isotope is defined as the time it
takes for half the original amount of parent isotope in a given sample to decay.
