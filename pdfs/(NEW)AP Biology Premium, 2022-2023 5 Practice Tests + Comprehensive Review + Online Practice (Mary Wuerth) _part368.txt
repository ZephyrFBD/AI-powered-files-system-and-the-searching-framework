The process of translation requires energy and involves three main steps in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes:
initiation of translation, elongation of the polypeptide chain, and termination of translation.
1. Initiation: The genetic code in mRNA is read in three base pair units called codons. Translation is initiated
when the rRNA in the ribosome pairs with the start codon (AUG). A tRNA with the complementary
anticodon (in this example, UAC) brings the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome, and the anticodon on
tRNA pairs with the codon on the mRNA. In this way, tRNA functions as an “adapter” molecule, linking the
correct amino acid with the correct codon on the mRNA. This process is called initiation and is shown in
Figure 16.3.

Each codon on mRNA codes for one amino acid, but multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. For example, the codons UCA, UCC,
UCG, and UCU all code
