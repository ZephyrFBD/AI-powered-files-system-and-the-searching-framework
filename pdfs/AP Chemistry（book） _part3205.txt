inverse relationship between the strengths of conjugate acids and bases. 
 (Section 16.2 
and Figure 16.3)
Check The cell potential is positive, as it must be for a voltaic cell.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider three voltaic cells, each similar to the one shown 
in Figure 20.5. In each voltaic cell, one half-cell contains a 
1.0 M Fe1NO3221aq2 solution with an Fe electrode. The con-
tents of the other half-cells are as follows:
Cell 1: a 1.0 M CuCl21aq2 solution with a Cu electrode
Cell 2: a 1.0  M NiCl21aq2 solution with a Ni electrode
Cell 3: a 1.0 M ZnCl21aq2 solution with a Zn electrode
In which voltaic cell(s) does iron act as the anode?  
(a) Cell 1 
(b) Cell 2 
(c) Cell 3 
(d) Cells 1 and 2 
(e) All three cells
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A voltaic cell is based on a Co2+>Co half-cell and a AgCl>Ag 
half-cell. (a) What half-reaction occurs at the anode?  
(b) What is the standard cell potential?
