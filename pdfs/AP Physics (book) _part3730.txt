Scale Factor (advanced)
The expansion of space can be described as a scaling of the typical distance between
two points or objects in the universe. If two distant galaxies are a distance 
apart at some initial time, then a time later they will be separated by a greater
distance 
The scale factor is the same as for light, expressed in Eq. 33–5a:
or
Thus, for example, if a galaxy has 
then the scale factor is now
times larger than when the light was emitted from that galaxy.
That is, the average distance between galaxies has become 4 times larger. Thus
the factor by which the wavelength has increased since it was emitted tells us by
what factor the universe (or the typical distance between objects) has increased.
