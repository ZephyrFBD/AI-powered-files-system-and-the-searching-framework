in a molecule. In contrast, molecules can rotate almost freely 
around the bond axis in single 1s2 bonds because this motion has 
no effect on the orbital overlap for a s bond. Rotation allows mol-
ecules with single bonds to twist and fold almost as if their atoms 
were attached by hinges.
Our vision depends on the rigidity of double bonds in reti-
nal. In its normal form, retinal is held rigid by its double bonds. 
Light entering the eye is absorbed by rhodopsin, and it is the en-
ergy of that light which is used to break the p@bond portion of the 
double bond shown in red in Figure 9.30. Breaking the double 
bond allows rotation around the bond axis, changing the geom-
etry of the retinal molecule. The retinal then separates from the 
opsin, triggering the reactions that produce a nerve impulse that 
the brain interprets as the sensation of vision. It takes as few as five 
closely spaced molecules reacting in this fashion to produce the 
sensation of vision. Thus, only five ph
