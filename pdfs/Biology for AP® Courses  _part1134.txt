l walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes
use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become
parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (Figure 10.9).
Figure 10.9 During cytokinesis in animal cells, a ring of actin filaments forms at the metaphase plate. The ring
contracts, forming a cleavage furrow, which divides the cell in two. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles coalesce at the former
metaphase plate, forming a phragmoplast. A cell plate formed by the fusion of the vesicles of the phragmoplast grows
from the center toward the cell walls, and the membranes of the vesicles fuse to form a plasma membrane that divides
the cell in two.

Use a set of pipe cleaners (or other materials as directed by your teacher) that you can use to model
chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis:

Each of the pipe cleaners represents a single, unreplicated chromosome. Each c
