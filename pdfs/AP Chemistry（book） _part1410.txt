itals 
can be hybridized to obtain different geometries, such as sp2 and sp3.
In BF3, for example, mixing the 2s and two of the 2p atomic orbitals yields three 
equivalent sp2 (pronounced “s-p-two”) hybrid orbitals (Figure 9.16). The three sp2 hybrid 
orbitals lie in the same plane, 120° apart from one another. They are used to make three 
equivalent bonds with the three fluorine atoms, leading to the trigonal-planar molecular 
geometry of BF3. Notice that an unfilled 2p atomic orbital remains unhybridized; it is ori-
ented perpendicular to the plane defined by the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, with one lobe 
above and one below the plane. This unhybridized orbital will be important when we 
discuss double bonds in Section 9.6.
An s atomic orbital can mix with all three p atomic orbitals in the same subshell. For 
example, the carbon atom in CH4 forms four equivalent bonds with the four hydrogen
