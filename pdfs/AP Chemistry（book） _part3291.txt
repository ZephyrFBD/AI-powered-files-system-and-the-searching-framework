You begin with the incomplete cell pictured here in which 
the electrodes are immersed in water.

(a) What additions must you make to the cell for it to gen-
erate a standard emf? (b) Which electrode functions as the 
cathode? (c) Which direction do electrons move through 
the external circuit? (d) What voltage will the cell generate 
under standard conditions? [Sections 20.3 and 20.4]
 
20.5  For a spontaneous reaction A1aq2 + B1aq2 ¡ A-1aq2 +
B+1aq2, answer the following questions:
(a) If you made a voltaic cell out of this reaction, what half- 
reaction would be occurring at the cathode, and what 
half-reaction would be occurring at the anode?
(b) Which half-reaction from (a) is higher in potential energy?
(c) What is the sign of E°
cell? [Section 20.3]
