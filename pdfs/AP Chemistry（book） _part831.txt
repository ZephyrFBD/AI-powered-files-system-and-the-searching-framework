e amount of heat transferred into or out of 
the system? (b) During a constant-pressure process, the sys-
tem releases heat to the surroundings. Does the enthalpy of 
the system increase or decrease during the process? (c) In a 
constant-pressure process, ∆H = 0. What can you conclude 
about ∆E, q, and w?
 5.35 Assume that the following reaction occurs at constant 
pressure:
 
 
2 Al1s2 + 3 Cl21g2 ¡  2 AlCl3(s)
 
 (a) If you are given ∆H for the reaction, what additional 
 
information do you need to determine ∆E for the process?
 
 (b) Which quantity is larger for this reaction? (c) Explain 
your answer to part (b).
(2) the piston is fixed so that it cannot move. (a) In which 
case does the gas have the higher temperature after addition 
of the electrical energy? (b) Identify the sign (positive, nega-
tive, or zero) of q and w in each case? (c) In which case is ∆E 
for the system (the gas in the cylinder) larger?
 5.28 Consider a system consisting of two oppositely charged 
spheres ha
