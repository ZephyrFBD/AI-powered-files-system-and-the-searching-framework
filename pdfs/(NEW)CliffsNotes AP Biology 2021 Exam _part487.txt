or plant responses to abiotic stimuli follow here:
1. Phototropism, the response to light, is achieved by the action of the hormone auxin. The process is described as
follows:
 
Auxin is produced in the apical meristem, the tip of the shoot where cell division and growth occurs. Auxin moves
down the shoot by active transport and generates growth by increasing the absorption of water. Auxin accomplishes
this by stimulating the
movement of H+ into the cell wall. The resulting decrease in pH
activates an enzyme that breaks down connections between cellulose fibers. This promotes the movement of water
into the cell, and the cell elongates as cell turgor increases.
When all sides of the apical meristem are equally illuminated, growth of the stem is uniform, and the stem grows
straight.
When the stem is unequally illuminated, auxin moves downward but concentrates on the shady side of the stem.
Auxin that would have normally accumulated on the sunny side ends up on the shady side.
