t cancer would alter this
process.
12. C
Learning Objective: 11.1
Cancer is defined principally as uncontrolled cell growth due to
dysregulation of the cell cycle, so the correct answer will most directly
address this mechanism. (C) does exactly this, so it is correct. (A)
assumes too much about the potential limitations of the immune
system, and neglects an explanation of why cancers tend to originate
at the site of viral infection, as opposed to some other part of the body.
(B) references disruption of the cell cycle, but a cell that cannot grow
or divide could not grow to create a tumor. Although viruses do divert
the host cell’s nutrients, this would not directly account for why cells at
the site of infection would become cancerous by growing and
multiplying faster than other cells, rendering (D) incorrect.
