If 
, ionization can not occur.
NOTE If the atom absorbed a photon of greater energy (wavelength shorter
than 22.8 nm), the atom could still be ionized and the freed electron would have
kinetic energy of its own.
In this Example 27–16, we saw that 
for the 
ion is four times more
negative than that for hydrogen. Indeed, the energy-level diagram for 
looks
just like that for hydrogen, Fig. 27–29, except that the numerical values for each
energy level are four times larger. Note, however, that we are talking here about
the
ion. Normal (neutral) helium has two electrons and its energy level
diagram is entirely different.
Hydrogen at 20°C. (a) Estimate the
average kinetic energy of whole hydrogen atoms (not just the electrons) at room
temperature. (b) Use the result to explain why, at room temperature, very few
H atoms are in excited states and nearly all are in the ground state, and hence
emit no light.
