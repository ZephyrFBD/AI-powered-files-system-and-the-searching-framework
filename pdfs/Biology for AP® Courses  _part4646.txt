e fish species at different trophic levels accumulate toxic substances brought
through the ecosystem by the primary producers. As illustrated in a study performed by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron (Figure 37.11), PCB concentrations increased
from the ecosystemâ€™s primary producers (phytoplankton) through the different trophic levels of fish species. The apex
consumer (walleye) has more than four times the amount of PCBs compared to phytoplankton. Also, based on results from
other studies, birds that eat these fish may have PCB levels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the
lake fish.
Figure 37.11 This chart shows the PCB concentrations found at the various trophic levels in the Saginaw Bay
ecosystem of Lake Huron. Numbers on the x-axis reflect enrichment with heavy isotopes of nitrogen (15N), which is a
marker for increasing trophic level. Notice that the fish in the higher trophic levels accumulate more
