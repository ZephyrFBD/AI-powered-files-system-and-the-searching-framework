Molecules in a breath
How many molecules in one breath? Esti-
mate how many molecules you breathe in with a 1.0-L breath of air.
APPROACH We determine what fraction of a mole 1.0 L is using the result of
Example 13–9 that 1 mole has a volume of 22.4 L at STP, and then multiply that
by 
to get the number of molecules in this number of moles.
SOLUTION One mole corresponds to 22.4 L at STP, so 1.0 L of air is
Then 1.0 L of air contains
(0.045 mol)A6.02 * 1023 moleculesmoleB L 3 * 1022 molecules.
(1.0 L)(22.4 Lmol) = 0.045 mol.

13–9 Kinetic Theory and the Molecular
Interpretation of Temperature
The analysis of matter in terms of atoms in continuous random motion is called
kinetic theory. We now investigate the properties of a gas from the po
