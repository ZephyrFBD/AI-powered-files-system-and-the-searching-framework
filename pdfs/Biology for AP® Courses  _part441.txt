e place in vacuoles. Enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of
proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. These enzymes are active at a much lower pH
than that of the cytoplasm. Therefore, the pH within lysosomes is more acidic than the pH of the cytoplasm. Many reactions
that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, so again, the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic
cell into organelles is apparent.
The Cell Wall
If you examine Figure 4.8b, the diagram of a plant cell, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called
the cell wall. The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell.
Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls. While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the
major organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose (Figure 4.16), a polysaccharide made up of glucose units. Have
