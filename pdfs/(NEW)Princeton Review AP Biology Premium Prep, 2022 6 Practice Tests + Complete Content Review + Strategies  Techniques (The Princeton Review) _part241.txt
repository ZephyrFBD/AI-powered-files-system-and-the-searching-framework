yl-CoA + 2CO2 + 2NADH
Are you keeping track of our carbons? Weâ€™ve now gone from two three-carbon molecules to two two-carbon
molecules. The extra carbons leave the cell in the form of CO2. Once again, two molecules of NADH are also
produced for each glucose you started with. This process of turning pyruvic acid into acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by an
enzyme complex called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
In the mitochondria, pyruvate is turned into acetyl-CoA and 1 NADH is made;
double this if you are counting per glucose.
Stage 3: The Krebs Cycle
The next stage is the Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle. Each of the two acetyl-coenzyme A
molecules will enter the Krebs cycle, one at a time, and all the carbons will ultimately be converted to CO2. This
stage occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria.
The Krebs cycle begins with each molecule of acetyl-CoA produced from the second stage of aerobic respiration
combining with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon molecule, to form a
