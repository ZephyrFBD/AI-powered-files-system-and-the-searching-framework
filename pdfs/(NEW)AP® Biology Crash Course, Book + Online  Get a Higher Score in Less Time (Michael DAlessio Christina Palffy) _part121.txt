 tumor-suppressor genes, exert negative control over cell division
processes, and when they are mutated, they may fail to keep cell growth under control.
The accumulation of mutated genes over an organismâ€™s lifetime can turn otherwise normal
cells into cancerous cells.
iv. Exposure to carcinogens and mutagens is the most likely cause of the somatic mutations that
contribute to cancer development, but mutagens may also cause germ cell mutations that are
carried by gametes.
Carcinogens are substances in the environment that increase the risk of cancer.
Most carcinogens are mutagens.
Mutagens are substances that cause mutations. Examples include tobacco, asbestos, x-rays,
ultraviolet light, and a host of other chemical substances in the environment.
v. Some viruses can contribute to cancer development by transferring oncogenes to host cells, or
causing mutations in proto-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes of host cells.
