usions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning
involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain
studies provide an example. In this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing a specific activity,
such as viewing images of food. The part of the brain that “lights up” during this activity is then predicted to be the part
controlling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. The “lighting up” of the various areas of the
brain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain. The resultant increase in
radioactivity is observed by a scanner. Then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.
Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reason, the pattern
of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to ind
