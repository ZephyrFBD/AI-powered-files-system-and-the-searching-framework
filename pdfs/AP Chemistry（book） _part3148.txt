 
(e) Use the data in the table to calculate ∆S° at 298 K 
for the vaporization of CS21l2. Is the sign of ∆S° as you 
would expect for a vaporization? (f) Using data in the 
table and your answer to part (e), estimate the boiling 
point of CS21l2. Do you predict that the substance will be 
a liquid or a gas at 298 K and 1 atm?

 Write the formation reaction for AgNO31s2. Based on 
this reaction, do you expect the entropy of the system to 
increase or decrease upon the formation of AgNO31s2? 
(b) Use ∆H°
f  and ∆G°
f  of AgNO31s2 to determine the 
entropy change upon formation of the substance. Is 
your answer consistent with your reasoning in part (a)? 
 
(c) Is dissolving AgNO3
