e in the center of the root. In (right) typical
monocots, the phloem cells and the larger xylem cells form a characteristic ring around the central pith.
Root Modifications
Root structures may be modified for specific purposes. For example, some roots are bulbous and store starch. Aerial roots

and prop roots are two forms of aboveground roots that provide additional support to anchor the plant. Tap roots, such as
carrots, turnips, and beets, are examples of roots that are modified for food storage (Figure 23.19).
Figure 23.19 Many vegetables are modified roots.
Epiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant. For example, the epiphytic roots of orchids develop a spongy
tissue to absorb moisture. The banyan tree (Ficus sp.) begins as an epiphyte, germinating in the branches of a host tree;
aerial roots develop from the branches and eventually reach the ground, providing additional support (Figure 23.20). In
screwpine (Pandanus sp.), a p
