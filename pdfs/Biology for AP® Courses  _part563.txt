quently leads to unconsciousness and
possibly coma because of the decrease in diffusion rate within the cells.
•
Solubility: As discussed earlier, nonpolar or lipid-soluble materials pass through plasma membranes more easily than
polar materials, allowing a faster rate of diffusion.
•
Surface area and thickness of the plasma membrane: Increased surface area increases the rate of diffusion, whereas a
thicker membrane reduces it.
•
Distance travelled: The greater the distance that a substance must travel, the slower the rate of diffusion. This places
an upper limitation on cell size. A large, spherical cell will die because nutrients or waste cannot reach or leave the

flattened, as with many single-celled eukaryotes.
