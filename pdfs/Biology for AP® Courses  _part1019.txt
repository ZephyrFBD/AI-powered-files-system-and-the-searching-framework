d.
A mutation must occur in the virus allowing the virus to infect a new host, and the virus must come into
contact with this host.
Cell-surface receptors are involved in most of the signaling in multicellular organisms. There are three general categories
of cell-surface receptors: ion channel-linked receptors, G-protein-linked receptors, and enzyme-linked receptors.
Ion channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass
through. To form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to
interact with the phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the
membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are
hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the
