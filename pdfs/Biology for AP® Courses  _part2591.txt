can be transplanted into germ-free (GF) mice to observe
the effects of diet in a controlled experiment of relatively
short duration. The microbiomes of healthy and
undernourished 6-month-old children were transplanted
into GF mice whose growth is graphed below. Growth in
both length and weight were reduced when the source of
the microbiome was the undernourished child (after
Blanton et al., Science, 2016). Both groups of mice were
provided with the same nutritional resources.
