Determining Solution Concentration by an Acid–Base Titration
One commercial method used to peel potatoes is to soak them in a NaOH solution for a short time and then remove the potatoes  
and spray off the peel. The NaOH concentration is normally 3 to 6 M, and the solution must be analyzed periodically. In one  
such analysis, 45.7 mL of 0.500 M H2SO4 is required to neutralize 20.0 mL of NaOH solution. What is the concentration of the  
NaOH solution?
Acids react with metal hydroxides to form water and a salt. 
Thus, the balanced equation for the neutraliz
