dent upon it. Good-quality cameras, microscopes, and other 
optical devices may contain six to ten thin lenses. Reflection from all these surfaces
can reduce the light level considerably, and multiple reflections produce a
background haze that reduces the quality of the image. By reducing reflection,
transmission and sharpness are increased.
A very thin coating on the lens surfaces can reduce reflections considerably.
The thickness of the coating is chosen so that light (at least for one wavelength)
reflecting from the front and rear surfaces of the film destructively interferes.
Destructive interference can occur nearly completely for one particular wavelength
depending on the thickness of the coating. Nearby wavelengths will at least 
partially destructively interfere, but a single coating cannot eliminate reflections
for all wavelengths. Nonetheless, a single coating can reduce total reflection 
from 4% to 1% of the incident light. Often the coating is designed to eliminate
the cent
