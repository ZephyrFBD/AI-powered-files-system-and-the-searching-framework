he cathode and anode, the concentra-
tions of reactants and products, and the temperature, which we will assume to be 
25 °C unless otherwise noted. In this section, we focus on cells that are operated 
at 25 °C under standard conditions. Recall from Table 19.2 that standard conditions 
include 1 M concentration for reactants and products in solution and 1 atm pressure 
for gaseous reactants and products. The cell potential under standard conditions is 
called either the standard cell potential or standard emf and is denoted E°

▲ Figure 20.7 Water analogy for electron flow. Just as water spontaneously flows downhill, electrons 
flow spontaneously from the anode to the cathode in a voltaic cell.
For the Zn–Cu voltaic cell in Figure 20.5, for example, the standard cell potential at 
25 °C is +1.10 V:
 
Zn1s2 + Cu2+1aq, 1 M2 ¡ Zn2+1aq, 1 M2 + Cu1s2  E°
