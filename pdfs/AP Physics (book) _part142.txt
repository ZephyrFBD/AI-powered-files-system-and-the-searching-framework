s less than zero. The sign of the displacement, and thus of the
average velocity, indicates the direction: the average velocity is positive for an
object moving to the right along the 
axis and negative when the object 
moves to the left. The direction of the average velocity is always the same as 
the direction of the displacement.
It is always important to choose (and state) the elapsed time, or time interval,
the time that passes during our chosen period of observation.
Runner’s average velocity. The position of a runner as a
function of time is plotted as moving along the x axis of a coordinate system.
During a 3.00-s time interval, the runner’s position changes from
to
as shown in Fig. 2–7. What is the runner’s average velocity?
APPROACH We want to find the average velocity, which is the displacement
divided by the elapsed time.
SOLUTION The displacement is
The elapsed time, or time interval, is given as
The average velocity 
(Eq. 2–2) is
The displacement and average velocity are
