computer chips is grown in large cylinders called 
“boules” that are 300 mm in diameter and 2 m in length, as 
shown. The density of silicon is 2.33 g>cm3. Silicon wafers 
for making integrated circuits are sliced from a 2.0-m boule 
and are typically 0.75 mm thick and 300 mm in diameter. 
 
(a) How many wafers can be cut from a single boule? 
 
(b) What is the mass of a silicon wafer? (The volume of a cyl-
inder is given by pr2h, where r is the radius and h is its height.)

 1.41  Use of the British thermal unit (Btu) is common in some 
types of engineering work. A Btu is the amount of heat 
 
required to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1°F. 
 
Calculate the number of joules in a Btu.
 1.42  A watt is a measure of power (the rate of energy change) equal 
to 1 J/s. (a) Calculate the number of joules in a kilowatt-hour. 
(b) An adult person radiates heat to the surroundings at 
about the same rate as a 100-
