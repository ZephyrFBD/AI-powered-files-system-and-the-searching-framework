bottom trophic level. When primary productivity is low, few trophic levels above it can be supported. In the absence
of predation by herbivores, primary producers expand without challenge. At some point, however, herbivores begin
to respond to the increasing availability of primary production, and herbivore populations expand. As herbivore
numbers increase, more primary producers are consumed, and their growth is checked. Then, predators respond to
increasing numbers of herbivores, limiting herbivore growth, which, in turn, allows growth of primary producers to
increase once again.
2. A top-down model describes how changes in the structure of trophic levels are regulated by changes in the top
trophic level. The model is essentially the opposite of the bottom-up model. For example, sea otters occupying the
top tier (as a keystone species described above) limit the number of sea urchins. With sea urchins in check, the
bottom trophic level of kelp forests increases in numbers. In contras
