thalpy of a system is what determines whether a pro-
cess is spontaneous. Thus, the formation of solutions is favored by the increase in entropy 
that accompanies mixing.
When molecules of different types are brought together, mixing occurs sponta-
neously unless the molecules are restrained either by sufficiently strong intermolecular 
forces or by physical barriers. Thus, gases spontaneously mix unless restrained by their 
containers because with gases intermolecular forces are too weak to restrain the mol-
ecules. However, when the solvent or solute is a solid or liquid, intermolecular forces 
become important in determining whether a solution forms. For example, although ionic 
bonds hold sodium and chloride ions together in solid sodium chloride 
 (Section 8.2), 
the solid dissolves in water because of the compensating strength of the attractive forces
