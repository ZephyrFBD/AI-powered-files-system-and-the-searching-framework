According to the model we design, indexes represent whether a country is 
sustainable. If index is less than 0.4, which means this country or one main factor of it 
is unsustainable.  
From the index we could know that Haitiâ€™s society, economy and ecology were 
all in unsustainable condition between 2005 and 2012 years. In conclusion, Haiti is an 
unsustainable country now. 
 
3.3 Third question: What to do to let Haiti become sustainable?    
    The answer is a 20 year sustainable development plan for Haiti.
