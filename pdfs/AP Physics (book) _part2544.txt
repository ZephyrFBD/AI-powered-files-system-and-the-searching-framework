he object seems farther away is that its image in the convex mirror is smaller
than it would be in a plane mirror, and we judge distance of ordinary objects 
such as other cars mostly by their size.
23–4 Index of Refraction
We saw in Chapter 22 that the speed of light in vacuum (like other EM waves) is
which is usually rounded off to
when extremely precise results are not required.
In air, the speed is only slightly less. In other transparent materials, such as
glass and water, the speed is always less than that in vacuum. For example, in water
light travels at about 
The ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed 
in a given material is called the index of refraction, n, of that material:
(23;4)
The index of refraction is never less than 1, and values for various materials are
given in Table 23–1. For example, since
for water, the speed of light 
in water is
As we shall see later, n varies somewhat with the wavelength of the light—except
in vacuum—so a particular wavelength is
