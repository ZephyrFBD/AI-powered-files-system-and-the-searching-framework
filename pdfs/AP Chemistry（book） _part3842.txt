More vigorous treatment results in substitution of a second nitro group into the molecule:
 
HNO3
NO2

 H2O
NO2

H2SO4

There are three isomers of benzene that contain two nitro groups—the 1,2- or ortho- 
isomer, the 1,3- or meta-isomer, and the 1,4- or para-isomer of dinitrobenzene:
NO2
NO2

In the reaction of Equation 24.11, the principal product is the meta isomer.
Bromination of benzene, carried out with FeBr3 as a catalyst, is another substitution

In a similar substitution reaction, called the Friedel–Crafts reaction, alkyl groups can 
be substituted onto an aromatic ring by reacting an alkyl halide with an aromatic com-
pound in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst:
 
CH3CH2
CH2CH3
