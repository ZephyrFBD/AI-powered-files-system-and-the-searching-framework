the membrane to be fluid, semipermeable, and to
require low energy to remain stable. The separation of the intracellular
and extracellular fluids is vital for cell communication and metabolism.
Waxes are lipids formed via dehydration synthesis, in which an ester
bond is formed between a long-chain alcohol (12–32 carbons) and a fatty
acid. Since waxes have hydrophobic properties, plants use them as
protective coatings to prevent losing excessive amounts of water and
drying out.
Steroids, though diﬀerent in structure than triglycerides and
phospholipids, are also considered lipids. Consisting of four fused rings
of carbon atoms and insoluble in water, sterol lipids form the basis of
steroid hormones. Cholesterol, for example, absorbs fat and is used to
produce hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin D.
PROTEINS
Making up half the total dry weight of cells, proteins function as
enzymes, structural materials, membrane transport, and signaling
molecules. Examples include lactas
