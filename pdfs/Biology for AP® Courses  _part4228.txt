and are the base of the food chain for most of the worldâ€™s fisheries.
Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone (Figure 35.21). Within the oceanic zone there is
thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents. Abundant plankton serve as the base of
the food chain for larger animals such as whales and dolphins. Nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less productive
part of the marine biome. When photosynthetic organisms and the protists and animals that feed on them die, their bodies
fall to the bottom of the ocean where they remain; unlike freshwater lakes, the open ocean lacks a process for bringing the
organic nutrients back up to the surface. The majority of organisms in the aphotic zone include sea cucumbers (phylum
Echinodermata) and other organisms that survive on the nutrients contained in the dead bodies of organisms in the photic
zone.
Beneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm, the deepwater region beyon
