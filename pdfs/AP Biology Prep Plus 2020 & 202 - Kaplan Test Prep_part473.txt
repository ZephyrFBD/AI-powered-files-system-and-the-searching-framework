ually. Both types
of reproduction lead to the production of spores, which are then
dissipated away from the parent organism via the wind or by latching
onto a passing animal. Fungi produce a large number of spores to
increase the likelihood that one of them will land in an environment that
will support its growth and survival.
Fungi reproduce asexually via fragmentation, budding, or spore
production. Fragmentation occurs when a fungal mycelium splits into
pieces, allowing each piece to grow into its own independent mycelium.
During budding, a large bulge forms on one side of the cell, the nucleus
divides, and the bud detaches from the parent cell. Spore production is
the most common form of asexual reproduction. The resulting spores are
genetically identical to the parent that produces them.
Fungal sexual reproduction begins with the production of two mating
types. If both of the mating types are present in the same mycelium, it is
termed homothallic, or self-fertile, reproduction. If
