he production of glucose, which supplies the plant with food, and
oxygen gas is a byproduct. (A) is thus correct. (B) is incorrect because
carbon dioxide is reduced and water oxidized. (C) is incorrect because
oxygen is not a food source. (D) is incorrect because it combines the
errors from (B) and (C).

A fatty acid molecule has a carboxylic acid group (COOH) that can
hydrogen bond with water molecules and a hydrocarbon chain that is
hydrophobic. The phosphate group (PO4), amino group (NH3), and
oxygen atoms on the fatty acid tails of phospholipids are all
hydrophilic, while the hydrocarbon chains are hydrophobic. As a
result, both of these molecules are capable of forming bilayers when
placed into water. Thus, (B)Â is correct. (A) is incorrect because fatty
acids do have a hydrophilic end. (C) is incorrect because fatty acids are
not completely hydrophilic and can form bilayers in water. (D)
conflates fatty acids with proteins.
