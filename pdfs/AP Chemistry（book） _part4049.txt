ed of an ozone 
molecule in the stratosphere is 306 m  >  s. 10.83 Statements 
 
(a) and (d) are true. 10.85 The order of increasing rate of effusion is 
2H37Cl 6  1H37Cl 6  2H35Cl 6  1H35Cl. 10.87 As4S6 
10.89 (a) Non-ideal-gas behavior is observed at very high pressures 
and low temperatures. (b) The real volumes of gas molecules and attrac-
tive intermolecular forces between molecules cause gases to behave 
nonideally. 10.91 Statement (b) is true. 10.93 (a) P = 4.89 atm  
(b) P = 4.69 atm (c) Qualitatively, molecular attractions are more 
important as the amount of free space decreases and the number of 
molecular collisions increases. Molecular volume is a larger part of the 
total volume as the container volume decreases. 10.95 From the value 
of b for Xe, the nonbonding radius is 2.72 Å. From Figure 7.7, the bond-
ing atomic radius of Xe is 1.40 Å. We expect the bonding radius of an 
atom to be smaller than its nonbonding radius, but our calculated value 
is nearly twice as large
