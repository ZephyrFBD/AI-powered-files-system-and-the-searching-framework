 mass 8.0 times
as great, were rotating at a speed of 1.0 revolution every
9.0 days. If it were to undergo gravitational collapse to a
neutron star of radius 12 km, losing of its mass in the pro-
cess, what would its rotation speed be? Assume the star is a
uniform sphere at all times. Assume also that the thrown-
off mass carries off either (a) no angular momentum, or
(b) its proportional share 
of the initial angular momentum.
91. A large spool of rope rolls on the ground with the end of
the rope lying on the top edge of the spool. A person grabs
the end of the rope and walks a distance , holding onto it,
Fig. 8–64. The spool rolls behind the person
without slipping. What length of rope unwinds
from the spool? How far
does the spool’s center of
mass move?

94. Most of our Solar System’s mass is contained in the Sun,
and the planets possess almost all of the Solar System’s
angular momentum. This observation plays a key role in
theories attempting to explain the formation of
