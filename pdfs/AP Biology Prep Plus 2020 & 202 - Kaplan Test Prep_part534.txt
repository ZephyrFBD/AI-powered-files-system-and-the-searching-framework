gnified at higher
trophic levels because each higher trophic level accumulates the
mercury that was absorbed at each lower trophic level. Tuna fish,
therefore, have accumulated mercury that the small fish accumulated
from the animal plankton that was accumulated from the
photosynthetic plankton. (B) correctly demonstrates this relationship.
The tuna fish have the highest concentrations of mercury, so (A) is
incorrect. Animal plankton have accumulated mercury from only a
single trophic level below them. Therefore, animal plankton do not
have the highest concentrations of mercury, making (C) incorrect.
Photosynthetic plankton have the lowest concentrations of mercury
since they accumulate mercury only from the ocean and not from any
trophic level below them. Therefore, (D) is incorrect.
