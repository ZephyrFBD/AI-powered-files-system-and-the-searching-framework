f this response, and that this communication affects
natural selection.
If there were no process that maintained variation in the
gene controlling the orange coloration then perhaps all
male guppies would symmetrically bright orange. Yet
variation remains.
B. A guppy is a small fish and small fish are eaten by
bigger fish. Make and justify a claim regarding the effect
of allelic variation on the stability of the guppy population.
Phenotype is an expression of the genotype and within a
population genotypic variation occurs. For a population to
maintain stability in a changing environment genetic
variation within the population provides selective
advantage at the population level.
C. Make and justify a claim regarding the effect of
genetic variation in guppies on the stability of an
ecosystem of which the guppy is a member.
The fluctuation of symmetry in body plan of an organism,
such as the asymmetry of guppy coloration, is unusual.
Large scale fluctuations where the fully developed
