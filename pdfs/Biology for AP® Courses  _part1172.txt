The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of
replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.16). Replication
of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double
strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As
the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared
the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of
a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of
other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cel
