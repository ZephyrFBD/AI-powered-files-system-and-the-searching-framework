plasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus.
Flagella and cilia, when present, are made of the protein tubulin arranged in "9 + 2" microtubule arrays.
2. Prokaryotic cells (prokaryotes) have the following characteristics: 
There is a single chromosome consisting of a short, circular DNA molecule. Some cells contain plasmids, smaller
circular DNA molecules, in addition to the major chromosome.
There is no nucleus.
 
There are no organelles, although various membranes might serve similar functions.
Flagella, when present, are made of the globular protein flagellin.
It is often useful to know the various methods that organisms use to obtain energy. For many organisms, especially
the prokaryotes, their method of energy acquisition is an important descriptive tool. There are two basic methods, as
follows:
1. Autotrophs manufacture their own organic molecules. To do this, photoautotrophs use light energy (as in
photosynthesis) and chemoautotrophs (chemolithoautotrophs) use energy obtained fro
