 92 natural elements, 96% of the mass of all living things is made up of just four of them: oxygen
(O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Other elements such as calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), potassium
(K), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), Chlorine (Cl), and magnesium (Mg) are also present, but in smaller quantities. These
elements make up most of the remaining four percent of a living thingâ€™s weight. Some elements are known as trace
elements because they are required by an organism only in very small quantities. Trace elements include iron (Fe),
iodine (I), and copper (Cu).
Where Are They Found?
Carbon and hydrogen and oxygen are found in all the macromolecules.
Nitrogen is found in proteins and nucleic acids. Phosphorus is found in nucleic
acids and some lipids.
SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
The smallest unit of an element that retains its characteristic properties is an atom. Atoms are the building blocks of
the physical world.
Within atoms, there are even smaller subatomic particles called
