atory proteins and allow regulatory proteins to
communicate.
Epigenetic changes can also affect gene expression in eukaryotes. Epigenetic changes can be reversible
modifications to the nucleotides of the DNA sequence, such as methylation (adding a methyl group) of nucleotides.
A methylated nucleotide is much less likely to be transcribed, so the cell can modify gene expression by changing
the level of methylation of the nucleotides in various genes.
The histone proteins around which DNA is packaged into chromosomes can also be epigenetically modified by
adding acetyl groups (acetylation) to the histone proteins. If histone proteins are acetylated, DNA will be more
loosely wound around the histone proteins, more accessible to RNA polymerase, and more likely to be expressed.
Euchromatin is DNA that is more loosely wound around the histone proteins, is more accessible to RNA
polymerase, and usually results in more expression of the genes in the euchromatin. DNA in chromosomes may be
tight
