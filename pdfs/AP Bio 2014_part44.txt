amorphosis in 
northern leopard frogs? 
(A) Place half of the fertilized eggs in a pool of 
water with the same concentration of 
atrazine as the contaminated pond and place 
the other half of the fertilized eggs in a pool 
of water that has no atrazine. Monitor the 
development of the embryos through 
metamorphosis into adulthood. 
(B) Place all of the fertilized eggs in a pool of 
pond water with the same concentration of 
atrazine as the contaminated pond and 
compare the number of frogs that reach 
metamorphosis to those that reach 
adulthood in the contaminated pond. 
(C) Allow all fertilized eggs to develop into 
adults. Expose one-third of the frogs to  
one-half of the concentration of atrazine  
in the contaminated pond and expose 
another one-third of the frogs to the  
same concentration of atrazine as the 
contaminated pond. Leave the last one-third 
of the frogs in water with no atrazine and 
note any adverse changes in the physical 
condition of the atrazine-treated frogs
