tals (the t2 set) and a higher- 
energy set of two degenerate orbitals (the e set). Visible light can cause 
a d-d transition, in which an electron is excited from a lower-energy 
d orbital to a higher-energy d orbital. The spectrochemical series lists 
ligands in order of their ability to increase the split in d-orbital ener-
gies in octahedral complexes.
Strong-field ligands create a splitting of d-orbital energies that 
is large enough to overcome the spin-pairing energy. The d electrons 
then preferentially pair up in the lower-energy orbitals, producing 
a low-spin complex. When the ligands exert a weak crystal-field, the 
splitting of the d orbitals is small. The electrons then occupy the 
higher-energy d orbitals in preference to pairing up in the lower- 
energy set, producing a high-spin complex. Transition metal ions from 
periods 5 and 6 have large crystal-field splitting energies and adopt 
low spin configurations in octahedral complexes.
Crystal-field theory also applies to
