hey are to other water molecules. The opposite is true for
mercury: the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces.

In tubes having very small diameters, liquids are observed to rise or fall rela-
tive to the level of the surrounding liquid. This phenomenon is called capillarity, and
such thin tubes are called capillaries. Whether the liquid rises or falls (Fig. 10–38)
depends on the relative strengths of the adhesive and cohesive forces. Thus water
rises in a glass tube, whereas mercury falls. The actual amount of rise (or fall)
depends on the surface tension—which is what keeps the liquid surface from
breaking apart.
