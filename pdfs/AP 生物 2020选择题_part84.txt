by adult corals at 32°C was 
approximately 14 nmol/mm2, and the DMSP produced by juveniles was 
approximately 3 nmol/mm2.
(D) 
Incorrect. This answer compares the DMSP in juveniles to adults 32°C 
rather than the reverse relationship.

(A) 
Incorrect. The passage states that the corals of the same species were 
grown in the same laboratory conditions.
(B) 
Correct. This experiment is also measuring the difference between the 
amount of DMSP produced by corals versus algae and corals together. 
It is also looking at the difference in DMSP produced by different-aged 
corals.
(C) 
Incorrect. This experiment is testing the
