s that are intimately tied to the processes of life. Life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an
organism’s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell’s cytoplasm. Special properties
of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive
properties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH. Understanding these characteristics of water
helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life.
Water’s Polarity
One of water’s important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water
molecules (H2O) form polar covalent bonds. While there is no net charge to a water molecule, the polarity of water creates
a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water’s properties of
attraction. Water’s charges are generated because oxygen is more electronegati
