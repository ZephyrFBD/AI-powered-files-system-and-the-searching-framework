The following are suggestions for the student-directed lab activities based on questions 
students ask during their preliminary study of the fruit flies. Their questions might 
include the following: Does the age of a fruit fly affect the speed of their negative geotactic 
response? What wavelengths of light stimulate a phototactic response in fruit flies? 
Possible investigations generated from students’ observations and questions include 
the following. However, it is suggested that students generate their own questions to 
explore. 
•  From an ingredient list, select substances (such as vinegar) that students think might 
be affecting fly behavior. Isolate the materials and give the flies a choice. 
•  Determine if the sex of the fly makes a difference in their choice. (An F1 population of 
flies with white-eyed males and red-eyed females could be made available.) 
•  Determine if the sight of the material makes a difference by covering up the cotton 
ball in parafilm. 
•  Fin
