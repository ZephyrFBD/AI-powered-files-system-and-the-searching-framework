This anomalous
behavior of water is of great importance for the survival of aquatic life during
cold winters.When water in a lake (or river) is above 4°C and begins to cool by contact 
with cold air, the water at the surface sinks because it is denser. It is replaced by
warmer water from below. This mixing continues until the temperature of the entire
lake reaches 4°C. As the surface water cools further, it remains on the surface
because it is less dense than the 4°C water below. Water thus freezes first at the
surface, and the ice remains on the surface since ice (specific
) is
less dense than water. The water at the bottom remains liquid unless it is so cold
that the whole body of water freezes. If water were like most substances, becoming
more dense as it cools, the water at the bottom of a lake would be frozen first.
gravity = 0.917
Lakes would freeze solid more easily because circulation would bring the warmer
water to the surface to be efficiently cooled. The complete freezing of
