henever we talk about speed, we necessarily bring in the notion of time. For 
example, the speed of a car is expressed as the change in the car’s position over a certain 
time interval. In the United States, the speed of cars is usually measured in units of miles 
per hour—that is, the quantity that is changing (position measured in miles) divided by 
a time interval (measured in hours).
Similarly, the speed of a chemical reaction—its reaction rate—is the change in the 
concentration of reactants or products per unit of time. The units for reaction rate are 
usually molarity per second 1M>s2—that is, the change in concentration measured in 
molarity divided by a time interval measured in seconds.
Let’s consider the hypothetical reaction A ¡ B, depicted in Figure 14.2. Each red 
sphere represents 0.01 mol of A, each blue sphere represents 0.01 mol of B, and the con-
tainer has a volume of 1.00 L. At the beginning of the reaction, there is 1.00 mol A, so the 
concentration is 1.00 mol
