nd lysosomes are all examples of membrane-bound
organelles that eukaryotes possess and are thus possible targets for
this drug.

Because multicellular organisms consist of more than one cell, their
cells usually take on specialized functions. Smooth ER play a large role
in the production of lipids and hormones, rough ER are important for
protein synthesis, Golgi bodies are important for protein packaging
and dissemination, lysosomes contain enzymes that break down
diﬀerent kinds of biomolecules, cell walls provide structural support
and rigidity, and cilia are important for cellular motility. Therefore, it is
possible to form hypotheses about the function of a specific cell based
on its concentration of these diﬀerent organelles. A cell that has an
abundant amount of rough ER and Golgi bodies is most likely to be
involved in protein production and packaging, which makes (B)
correct. The lack of cilia and moderate amount of mitochondria, which
can provide energy for movement, make
