work function— 
is required for the electrons to overcome the attractive forces holding them in 
 
the metal. If the photons striking the metal have less energy than the work function, 
the electrons do not acquire sufficient energy to escape from the metal. Increasing the 
intensity of the light source doesn’t lead to emission of electrons from the metal; only 
changing the frequency of the incoming light has that effect. The intensity (bright-
ness) of the light is related to the number of photons striking the surface per unit time 
but not to the energy of each photon. When the frequency is such that photons have 
energy greater than the work function of the particular metal, electrons are emitted; 
any excess energy of the photon is converted into kinetic energy of the emitted elec-
tron. Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 primarily for his explanation of 
the photoelectric effect.
