tion passes through a point on the
edge of the disk. Will the moment of inertia be the same,
larger, or smaller? Explain why.
10. Two inclines have the same height but make different
angles with the horizontal. The same steel ball rolls without
slipping down each incline. On which incline will the speed
of the ball at the bottom be greater? Explain.
11. Two spheres look identical and have the same mass. How-
ever, one is hollow and the other is solid. Describe an
experiment to determine which is which.
12. A sphere and a cylinder have the same radius and the same
mass. They start from rest at the top of an incline. (a) Which
reaches the bottom first? (b) Which has the greater speed at the
bottom? (c) Which has the greater total kinetic energy at the
bottom? (d) Which has the greater rotational kinetic energy?
