56. Only a fraction of DNA encodes proteins. The
noncoding portion of a gene is referred to as the intron.
The intron fraction depends upon the gene. Introns are rare
in prokaryotic and mitochondrial DNA; in human nuclear
DNA, this fraction is about 95%. The intron is transcribed
into mRNA, but this noncoding mRNA is edited out
before translation of the coding portion, or exon, of a gene.
The edited exon segments are then spliced together by a
spliceosome, a very large and complex collection of RNAs
and proteins.
Although introns do not encode proteins, they have
functions. In particular, they amplify expression of the
exon, although the mechanism is unknown. When introns
are very long, which is common among mammalian genes
with roles in development, they can significantly extend
the time required to complete transcription. Analysis of
genes common to different plant and animal species shows
many shared intronic positions and base sequences,
although in some organisms, such as yea
