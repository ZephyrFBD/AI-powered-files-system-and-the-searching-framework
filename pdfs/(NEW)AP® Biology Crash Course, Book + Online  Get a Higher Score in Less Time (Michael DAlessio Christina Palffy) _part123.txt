 host.
4. During the lysogenic cycle, the virus replicates its genome without killing the host and forms
prophage (incorporation of the viral DNA into the host chromosome).
D. Viruses are efficient at rapid evolution and acquiring new phenotypes. The wide variety of possible hosts,
and in turn, the enormous possibilities of chromosomes and their respective genes through which a virus
can replicate itself all contribute to viruses’ abilities to possess the potential for expansive genetic
variations.
E. HIV, the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a retrovirus; it uses an
enzyme called reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA from an RNA strand and infects T4 helper cells.
F. Prion is the protein infectious particle or misfolded protein that converts other normal proteins into
mutant form; it is also the causative agent for “mad cow disease.”
IV.
Variation Due to Sexual Reproduction
A. Sexual reproduction produces genetic variation in three ways: independent a
