nergy phosphorylates
ATP. ATP made this way is called oxidative phosphorylation.
Choices A and B describe glycolysis. Choice C describes oxidative
phosphorylation at the ATP synthase channel. However, the ATP
synthase channel is not shown in this figure. (ENE-1)
(B) Oxygen, which is very strongly electronegative, pulls the
electrons through the ETC. This flow of electrons is exergonic and
powers the pumping of protons (ions) against a gradient. (ENE-1)
(A) When ATP levels in the cytoplasm are high, PFK is inhibited.
The reverse is also true. The only graph that shows the correct
relationship is the graph for choice A. (ENE-3)
(B) This choice is the essence of how ATP is produced during
oxidative phosphorylation. Protons flow down a gradient through
the ATP synthase channel. The force of that flow powers the
phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. (ENE-1)
(B) Oxygen pulls electrons down a gradient in the ETC. This process
is exergonic and therefore releases energy. The pumping of protons
