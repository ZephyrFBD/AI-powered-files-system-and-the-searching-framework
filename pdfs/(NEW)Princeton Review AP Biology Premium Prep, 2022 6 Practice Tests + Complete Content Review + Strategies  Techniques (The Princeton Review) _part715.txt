Iguanodon had one common ancestor with Hypsilophodon before Hypsilophodon diverged. Iguanodon
had two with Tenontosaurus because one came from where Tenontosaurus diverged and they both share
the common ancestor with Hypsilophodon. By that logic, Iguanodon has three common ancestors with
Zalmoxes, four with Dryosaurus, and five with Camptosaurus. It will also share those five common
ancestors with the other species on the tree, because everything above Camptosaurus still shares those
original five. The higher levels also share the ancestor that existed when Iguanodon diverged. Either way,
six species share at least four common ancestors with Iguanodon. Remember, donâ€™t count Iguanodon
itself.

Higher order protein structure depends on the original amino acid sequence, (B), the interactions between
the side chains of the amino acids, (C), and the interactions between other polypeptides, (D). Ester
linkages are not the linkages between proteins.
