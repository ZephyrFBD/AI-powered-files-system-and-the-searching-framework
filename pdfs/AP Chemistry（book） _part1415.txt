id orbitals is greater than the amount returned by forming bonds with the six 
fluorine atoms. Theoretical calculations suggest that the sulfur 3d orbitals do not partici-
pate to a significant degree in the bonding between sulfur and the six fluorine atoms, and 
that it would not be valid to describe the bonding in SF6 in terms of six hybrid orbitals. 
The more detailed bonding model needed to discuss the bonding in SF6 and other hyper-
valent molecules requires a treatment beyond the scope of a general chemistry text. For-
tunately, the VSEPR model, which explains the geometrical properties of such molecules 
in terms of electrostatic repulsions, does a good job of predicting their geometries.
This discussion reminds us that models in science are not reality but rather are our 
attempts to describe aspects of reality that we have been able to measure, such as bond 
distances, bond energies, molecular geometries, and so on. A model may work well 
up to a certain point but not beyond i
