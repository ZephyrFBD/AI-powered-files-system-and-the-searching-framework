pressure is increased by addition 
of N21g2, (d) the volume is increased, (e) the temperature is decreased?
Sample Exercise 15.12
 Using Le Châtelier’s Principle to Predict Shifts in Equilibrium
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a series of changes to be made to a system at 
equilibrium and are asked to predict what effect each change will 
have on the position of the equilibrium.
Plan Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to determine the effects 
of each of these changes.
Solve
(a) The system will adjust to decrease the concentration of the 
added N2O4, so the equilibrium shifts to the right, in the 
direction of the product.
(b) The system will adjust to the removal of NO2 by shifting to the 
side that produces more NO2; thus, the equilibrium shifts to 
the right.
(c) Adding N2 will increase the total pressure of the system, but 
N2 is not involved in the reaction. The partial pressures of NO2 
and N2O4 are therefore unchanged, and there is no shift in the 
position of the equilibrium.
