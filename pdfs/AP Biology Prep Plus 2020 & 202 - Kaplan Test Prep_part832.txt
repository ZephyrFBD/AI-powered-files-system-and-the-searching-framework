Dynamics Investigation
Using a model ecosystem, this investigation explores how matter and
energy flow, the roles of producers and consumers, and the complex
interactions between organisms. First, estimate the net primary
productivity of Wisconsin Fast Plants growing under lights, and then
determine the flow of energy from the plants to cabbage white butterflies
as the larvae consume cabbage-family plants.
Remember that the source of almost all energy on Earth is the Sun. Free
energy from sunlight is captured by producers that convert the energy to
oxygen and carbohydrates through photosynthesis. The net amount of
energy captured and stored by the producers in a system is the system’s
net productivity. Net productivity is calculated by assuming the change in
biomass of a plant is due to uptake and use of energy.
