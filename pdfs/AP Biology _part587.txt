ating behavior even dictates morphological
characteristics. Among polygynous species, such as elk, one male
inseminates many females and the males are larger and more highly
ornamented. This difference in appearance between males and females is
called sexual dimorphism. In animal species where the female mates with
more than one male, known as polyandrous species, the female is the
showier of the two.
EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR
Some behaviors are simply controlled by a gene or a set of genes. Think of
spiderwebs. Each web is characteristic of a particular species. Since the
adult spider dies before the eggs hatch, a spider cannot learn to build a
particular web from its parent. So the control of the behavior—spinning a
web—must be genetic.
To understand the ultimate cause of a behavior, one must look at the
behavior in terms of what selective advantage it confers on the individual
or group. An interesting behavior that exemplifies this is altruism.
