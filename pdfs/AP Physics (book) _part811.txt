8–3 Rolling Motion (Without Slipping)
The rolling motion of a ball or wheel is familiar in everyday life: a ball rolling
across the floor, or the wheels and tires of a car or bicycle rolling along the pave-
ment. Rolling without slipping depends on static friction between the rolling object
and the ground. The friction is static because the rolling object’s point of contact
with the ground is at rest at each moment
