trate that each medium can support growth.
A mutation in the sequence of nucleotide bases aﬀects the sequence of amino acids.
In enzyme synthesis, a change in amino acid sequence alters protein structure and function.
Grow wild type Neurospora on minimal medium and
minimal medium with each supplement
To demonstrate wild type Neurospora grows on each
medium
(c) Using the data in the table, identify the intermediates of the arginine pathway on the
template provided. (3 points maximum)
Identification (1 point for each of the 3 intermediates)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
(d) Provide reasoning for the intermediates on the pathway. (3 points maximum)
Reasoning (1 point each, 3 points maximum)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
If a mutant grows in supplemented minimal medium, it suggests that the supplement is a
product of the pathway disrupted by the mutant. Mutant 4 grows if given arginine, citrulline,
and argininosuccinate but not or
