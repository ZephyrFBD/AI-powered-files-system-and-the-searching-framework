47. Cancer comprises many different diseases with a
common cause: uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer is a
complex response to a host of environmental mutagens as
well as the accumulation of random mutations. Since the
“war on cancer” began in 1971, the death rate due to
cancer has changed very little despite the discovery of
several tumor suppressor genes, including p53.

A.
Briefly describe the multiple functions of p53,
including the role of p53 in apoptosis.
B.
A principle of biology is that “form follows
function.” The protein p53, which has multiple
functions, is named for its molecular
mass—approximately 53 kDa. This is not a large
polymer by comparison with other proteins; for
example, ATP synthase, which has only one
function, has a molecular mass of approximately
550 kDa. Based on analogies to processes
involved in cellular signaling, create a model(s)
to explain how so many functions can be
supported by a single, relatively si
