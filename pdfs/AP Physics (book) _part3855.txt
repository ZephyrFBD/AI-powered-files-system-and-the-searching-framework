ugh the two atoms
would give rise to very little energy since the moment of inertia is so small). The
molecules can have rotational as well as translational kinetic energy.
It is useful to introduce the idea of degrees of freedom, by which we mean
the number of independent ways molecules can possess energy. For example,
a monatomic gas has three degrees of freedom, because an atom can have velocity
along the x, y, and z axes. These are considered to be three independent motions
because a change in any one of the components would not affect the others.
A diatomic molecule has the same three degrees of freedom associated with trans-
lational kinetic energy plus two more degrees of freedom associated with rotational
kinetic energy (Fig. D–1), for a total of five degrees of freedom.
