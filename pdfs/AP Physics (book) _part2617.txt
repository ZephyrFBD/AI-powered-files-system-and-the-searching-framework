 focal length is 28.9 cm, what is the index of
refraction of the lens material?
*65. (I) A planoconvex lens (Fig. 23–31a) with
is to
have a focal length of 16.3 cm. What is the radius of curva-
ture of the convex surface?
*66. (II) A symmetric double convex lens with a focal length of
22.0 cm is to be made from glass with an index of refraction
of 1.52. What should be the radius of curvature for each
surface?
*67. (II) A prescription for an eyeglass lens calls for 
diop-
ters. The lensmaker grinds the lens from a “blank” with
and convex front surface of radius of curvature
of 30.0 cm. What should be the radius of curvature of the
other surface?
*68. (III) An object is placed 96.5 cm from a glass lens 
with one concave surface of radius 22.0 cm and one convex
surface of radius 18.5 cm. Where is the final image? What
is the magnification?
