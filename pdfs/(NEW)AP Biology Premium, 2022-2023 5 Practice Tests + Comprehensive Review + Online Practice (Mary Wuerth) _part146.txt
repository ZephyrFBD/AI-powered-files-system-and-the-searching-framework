t. Because water flows from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, water will
be constantly flowing from the higher water potential in the freshwater environment into the paramecium. If this
were unregulated, excess water would build up inside the paramecium and eventually the cell would burst. To
counter this, paramecia have a specialized organelle, a contractile vacuole, in which this excess water entering the
cell is stored and then pumped out of the cell. This allows the paramecium to maintain its internal solute
concentration.
The cells in a saltwater fish have a lower solute concentration and a higher water potential than their marine
environment. In this scenario, water would be constantly flowing out of the fish cells (which have a higher water
potential) into the saltwater surrounding the fish (which has a lower water potential). To counteract this, the
saltwater fish is constantly drinking large quantities of saltwater. The fish retains the water,
