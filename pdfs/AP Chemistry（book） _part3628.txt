 22.80  Although the ClO4
- and IO4
- ions have been known for a 
long time, BrO4
- was not synthesized until 1965. The ion was 
synthesized by oxidizing the bromate ion with xenon diﬂu-
oride, producing xenon, hydroﬂuoric acid, and the perbro-
mate ion. (a) Write the balanced equation for this reaction. 
(b) What are the oxidation states of Br in the Br-containing 
species in this reaction?
 22.81  Write a balanced equation for the reaction of each of the 
following compounds with water: (a) SO21g2, (b) Cl2O71g2, 
(c) Na2O21s2, (d) BaC21s2, (e) RbO
