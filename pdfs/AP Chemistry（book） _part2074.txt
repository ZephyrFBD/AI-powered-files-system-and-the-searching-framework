xtent, or a greater extent than adding 1 mol of C6H12O6 to 1 kg

Glycerin 1C3H8O32 is a nonvolatile nonelectrolyte with a density of 1.26 g>mL at 25 °C. Calculate the vapor pressure at 25 °C 
of a solution made by adding 50.0 mL of glycerin to 500.0 mL of water. The vapor pressure of pure water at 25 °C is 23.8 torr 
(Appendix B), and its density is 1.00 g>mL.
Solve
To calculate the mole fraction of water 
in the solution, we must determine the 
number of moles of C3H8O3 and H2O:
Analyze Our goal is to calculate the vapor pressure of a solution, 
given the volume of solute and solvent and the density of the 
solute.
Comment The vapor pressure of the solution has been lowered by 
23.8 torr - 23.2 torr = 0.6 torr relative to that of pure water. The 
vapor–pressure lowering can be calculated directly using Equa-
tion 13.11 together with the mole fraction of the solute, C3H8O3:  
∆P = XC3H8O3P°
H2O = 10.0242123.8 torr2 = 0.57 torr. Notice that 
the use of Equation 13.11 gives one
