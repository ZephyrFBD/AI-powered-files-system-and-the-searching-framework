In your lab notebook, record data, answers to questions, and any questions that arise 
during this part of the activity. 
Step 1 Form lab teams, as instructed by your teacher. Familiarize yourself with sterile 
technique, materials and lab equipment, and safety procedures for handling bacteria and 
decontaminating the work area. 
Step 2 Label one closed microcentrifuge tube (micro test tube) “+ plasmid” and one tube 
“-plasmid.” (What do the “+” and “-” symbols mean?) Label both tubes with your group’s 
number (e.g., G2), and place them in the microcentrifuge tube holder/float. 
Step 3 Carefully open the tubes and, using a 100–1000 μL bulb pipette with a sterile tip, 
transfer 250 μL of the ice cold transformation solution (CaCl2) into each tube. (Note that 
“μl” and “μL” are al
