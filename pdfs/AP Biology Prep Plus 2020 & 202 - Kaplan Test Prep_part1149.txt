inues to go up over time. This
suggests that protein X stimulates transcription of the operon through a
positive feedback loop, potentially through its ability to bind the X operon
promoter. In this question, the researcher is using E. coli cells that make a
mutant version of protein X that can no longer bind the X operon
promoter, indicating an inability to induce transcription. When wild-type
protein X, which can bind the X operon promoter, is added to the mutant
E. coli, an initial increase in transcription of the mutant protein X would be
expected, eliminating (B) and (C). However, the amount of mutant protein
X would eventually level oﬀ because the mutant protein made by the
mutant E. coli cells would not be able to sustain a positive feedback loop,
which makes (A) incorrect and matches (D).

When protein X is added into the system in Experiment 1, protein X levels
continue to rise aȇerward, suggesting protein X induces transcription of
the X operon in a positive feedback loo
