Proteins are long chains of different sequences of the 20 amino acids that each contain an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl
group (-COOH), and a variable group. (Think of how many protein “words” can be made with 20 amino acid “letters”).
Each amino acid is linked to its neighbor by a peptide bond formed by a dehydration reaction. A long chain of amino acids
is known as a po
