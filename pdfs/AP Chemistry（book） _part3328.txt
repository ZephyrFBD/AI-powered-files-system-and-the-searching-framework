+1.12 V. (a) By 
using data in Appendix E, calculate the standard emf of this 
voltaic cell. (b) Will the concentration of Ni2+1aq2 increase 
or decrease as the cell operates? (c) What is the initial con-
centration of Ag+1aq2 in the Ag+-Ag half-cell?
 
[20.102]  A voltaic cell is constructed that uses the following half-cell 
reactions:
Cu+1aq2 + e- ยก Cu1s2
I21s2 + 2 e-
 ยก 2 I-1aq2
The cell is operated at 298 K with 3Cu+4 = 0.25 M and 
3I-4 = 0.035 M. (a) Determine E for the cell at these con-
centrations. (b) Which electrode is the anode of the cell? 
(c) Is the answer to part (b) the same as it would be if the cell 
were operated under standard conditions? (d) If 3Cu+4 were 
equal to 0.15 M, at what concentration of I- would the cell 
have zero potential?

Using data from Appendix E, calculate the equilibrium 
constant for the disproportionation of the copper(I) ion at 
room temperature:
2 Cu+1aq2 ยก Cu2+1aq2 + Cu1s2.
