ections for the magnetic field 
correspond to the two possible values for the 
spin quantum number, ms. The magnetic 
fields that emanate from materials, like iron, 
arise because there are more electrons with 
one spin direction than the other.
*As we discussed earlier, the electron has both particle-like and wave-like properties. Thus, the pic-
ture of an electron as a spinning charged sphere is, strictly speaking, just a useful pictorial represen-
tation that helps us understand the two directions of magnetic field that an electron can possess.
tells us, however, that there can be at most two electrons in any single orbital. Thus, the 
orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy, with no more than two electrons per orbital. For 
example, consider the lithium atom, which has three electrons. (Recall that the number 
of electrons in a neutral atom equals its atomic number.) The 1s orbital can accommo-
date two of the electrons. The third one goes into the next lowest-energy orbi
