even at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 13–23).
The intersection of the three curves (in Fig. 13–22) is the triple point. For
water this occurs at
and
It is only at the
triple point that the three phases can exist together in equilibrium. Because the
triple point corresponds to a unique value of temperature and pressure, it is pre-
cisely reproducible and is often used as a point of reference. For example, the
standard of temperature is usually specified as exactly 273.16 K at the triple point
of water, rather than 273.15 K at the freezing point of water at 1 atm.
Notice that the solid-liquid 
curve for water (Fig. 13–22) slopes upward to
the left. This is true only of substances that expand upon freezing: at a higher pres-
sure, a lower temperature is needed to cause the liquid to freeze. More commonly,
substances contract upon freezing and the 
curve slopes upward to the right,
as shown for carbon dioxide 
in Fig. 13–23.
The phase transitions we have been discussing are the common ones. S
