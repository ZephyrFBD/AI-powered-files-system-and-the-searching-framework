nthesis and cellular respiration. The neuron,
however, uses Na+ and K+ to establish a gradient. It is also important to recall that ions cannot diffuse across the lipid
bilayer of the cell membrane and must use transport proteins; in this case, the transport proteins are voltage-gated Na+ and
K+ channels.
At rest, the Na+/K+ pump, powered by ATP, maintains this gradient, known as resting membrane potential. In response
to a stimulus, such as an odorant molecule, membrane potential changes, and an action potential is generated along
the membrane as the voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels open sequentially, causing the membrane to depolarize. In
depolarization, the inside of the membrane becomes more positive than the outside as Na+ flows to the inside.
Repolarization occurs when K+ flows across the membrane to the outside. In myelinated neurons, action potentials “jump”
between gaps of unmyelinated axons (nodes of Ranvier), a phenomenon called saltatory conduction.
