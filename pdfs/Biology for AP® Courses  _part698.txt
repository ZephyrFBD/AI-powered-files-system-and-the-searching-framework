ther molecule via a process called phosphorylation.
The phosphorylated molecule is at a higher energy state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated form and free energy
is released to substrates to perform work during this process. Phosphorylation is an example of energy transfer between
molecules.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big
Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® Exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
