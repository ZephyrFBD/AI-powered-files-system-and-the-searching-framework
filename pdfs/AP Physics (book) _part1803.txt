ion of charge in the paper, and explain why attrac-
tion occurs.
6. Contrast the net charge on a conductor to the “free
charges” in the conductor.
7. Figures 16–7 and 16–8 show how a charged rod placed near
an uncharged metal object can attract (or repel) electrons.
There are a great many electrons in the metal, yet only
some of them move as shown. Why not all of them?
8. When an electroscope is charged, its two leaves repel each
other and remain at an angle. What balances the electric
force of repulsion so that the leaves don’t separate further?
9. The balloon in Fig. 16–48 was rubbed on a student’s hair.
Explain why the water drip curves instead of falling
vertically.
Questions
12. We are not normally aware of the gravitational or electric
force between two ordinary objects. What is the reason in
each case? Give an example where we are aware of each
one and why.
13. Explain why the test charges we use when measuring elec-
tric fields must be small.
