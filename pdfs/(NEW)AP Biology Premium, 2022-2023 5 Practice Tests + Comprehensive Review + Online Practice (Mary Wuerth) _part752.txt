sity-independent factor. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are all density-dependent factors and are
therefore incorrect.
57. (B) Both species are competing for the same food source (nutrient-rich sap from the host plant), so this is an
example of interspecies competition. Choice (A) is incorrect because intraspecies competition is when members
of the same species compete for a resource. Mutualism is when both species benefit. F. formicaria is harmed by
the presence of F. geocia, so choice (C) is incorrect. Both Fordinae species are parasites of the host plants but
not of each other, so choice (D) is incorrect.
58. (D) Both Fordinae species are parasites on the host plant because they obtain nutrition from the host plant but
provide no benefit to the host plant. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect, as explained in the answer
explanation to Question 57.
59. (B) Catfish declined by over 90% after the introduction of the carp. Bass decreased by about 50%, so choice
(A) is incorrect. Steelhead
