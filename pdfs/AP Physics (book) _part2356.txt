rite, and is too slow to use as RAM. Instead, flash memory
can be used in place of a hard drive as general storage in computers and tablets,
and may be called a “solid state device” (SSD). Flash is also used for flash drives,
memory cards (such as SD cards), thumb drives, cell phone and portable player
memory, and external computer memory.
Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) is a recent development, involving (again)
magnetic properties. One cell (storing one bit) consists of two tiny ferromagnetic
plates (separated by an insulator), one of which is permanently magnetized.
The other plate can be magnetized in one direction or the other, for a “1” or
a “0”, by current in nearby wires. Cell size is a bit large, but MRAM is fast and
nonvolatile (no power and no refresh needed) and therefore has the potential to
be used as any type of memory.
