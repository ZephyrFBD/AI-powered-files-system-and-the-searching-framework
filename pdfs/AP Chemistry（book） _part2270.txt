CHAPTER 14 Chemical Kinetics
So far we have considered only three reaction mechanisms: one for a reaction that 
occurs in a single elementary step and two for simple multistep reactions where there is 
one rate-determining step. There are other more complex mechanisms, however. If you 
take a biochemistry class, for example, you will learn about cases in which the concentra-
tion of an intermediate cannot be neglected in deriving the rate law. Furthermore, some 
mechanisms require a large number of steps, sometimes 35 or more, to arrive at a rate law 
that agrees with experimental data!
14.7 ∣ Catalysis
A catalyst is a substance that changes the speed of a chemical reaction without under-
going a permanent chemical change itself. Most reactions in the body, the atmosphere, 
and the oceans occur with
