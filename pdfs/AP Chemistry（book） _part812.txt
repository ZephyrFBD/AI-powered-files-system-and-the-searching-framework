ch is the energy that an object possesses by vir-
tue of its position relative to other objects. An electron in motion 
near a proton has kinetic energy because of its motion and po-
tential energy because of its electrostatic attraction to the proton.
Chemical energy originates largely from electrostatic in-
teractions at the atomic level. Energy must be supplied to break 
chemical bonds leading to an increase in potential energy. Con-
versely, energy is released when chemical bonds form as the po-
tential energy decreases.
THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS (SECTION 5.2) When 
we study thermodynamic properties, we define a specific amount 
of matter as the system. Everything outside the system is the sur-
roundings. When we study a chemical reaction, the system is gen-
erally the reactants and products. A closed system can exchange 
energy, but not matter, with the surroundings. The internal en-
ergy of a system is the sum of all the kinetic and potential ener-
gies of its component par
