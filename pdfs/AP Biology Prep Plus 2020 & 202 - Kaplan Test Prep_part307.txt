sent signal
transduction pathway persists because the pathway results in a stable
population that is able to survive and reproduce. Otherwise, the selective
pressure will cause the population to undergo natural selection and
evolve. For instance, a mutation that alters the phenotype of an organism
will spread in a population if the mutation enhances the behavior, fitness,
and reproduction of the organism.
Signal transduction pathways of hormones (specifically peptide
hormones) generally involve the binding of a hormone to a cell-surface
receptor, which induces a conformational change in the receptor protein
and sets oﬀ an intracellular cascade to alter the cell’s behavior in some
way. Cell-surface receptors come in three diﬀerent forms: ion-channel-
linked, G-protein-linked, and enzyme-linked.
Ion-channel-linked receptors are also called ligand-gated channels. These
membrane-spanning proteins undergo a conformational change when a
ligand binds to them so that a “tunnel” is opened throu
