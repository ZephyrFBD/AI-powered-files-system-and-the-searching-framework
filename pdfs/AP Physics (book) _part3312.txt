In a p-type semiconductor, a hole is
(a) a region in the molecular structure where an atom is
missing.
(b) an extra electron from one of the donor atoms.
(c) an extra positively charged particle in the molecular
structure.
(d) a region missing an electron relative to the rest of the
molecular structure.
8. The electrical resistance of a semiconductor may 
decrease with increasing temperature because, at elevated
temperature, more electrons
(a) collide with the crystal lattice.
(b) move faster.
(c) are able to jump across the energy gap.
(d) form weak van der Waals bonds.
9. Which of the following would not be used as an impurity in
doping silicon?
(a) Germanium.
(b) Gallium.
(c) Boron.
(d) Phosphorus.
(e) Arsenic.
10. Why are metals good conductors?
(a) Gaining a tiny bit of energy allows their electrons to
move.
(b) They have more electrons than protons, so some of
the electrons are extra and free to move.
(c) They have more protons than electrons, so some of
the protons are extra and
