Insecticide resistance occurs as a result of directional selection. Because traits of individuals vary in a population,
some individuals may possess some degree of resistance to the insecticide. These few individuals survive and
produce offspring, most of whom will inherit the insecticide-resistance trait. After several generations of directional
selection, the population will consist of nearly all insecticide-resistant individuals.
The peppered moth provides an example of directional selection of moth color from a light to a dark color. Before
the industrial revolution, the light form of the moth was well camouflaged among the light-colored lichens that grew
on tree barks around London. Since color variation is known to exist in other moths, the dark form of the moth

advent of the industrial revolution, soot killed the pollution-sensiti
