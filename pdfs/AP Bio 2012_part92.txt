the DNA molecules between the hydrogen bonds connecting the two strands. 
DNA polymerase “reads” each template strand in the 3'-to-5' direction and 
assembles the growing DNA chain in a 5'-to-3' direction. The “leading” strand 
is produced continuously, but on the “lagging” strand, Okazaki fragments are 
produced and are connected by ligase to produce the daughter molecule.
