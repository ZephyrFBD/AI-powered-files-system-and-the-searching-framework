tions (or “waves”), as shown in Fig. 17–37.
Each of the deflections corresponds to the activity of a particular part of the heart
beat (Fig. 10–42). The P wave corresponds to contraction of the atria. The QRS
group corresponds to contraction of the ventricles as the depolarization follows 
a very complicated path. The T wave corresponds to recovery (repolarization) of
the heart in preparation for the next cycle.
The ECG is a powerful tool in identifying heart defects. For example, the right
side of the heart enlarges if the right ventricle must push against an abnormally large
load (as when blood vessels become hardened or clogged). This problem is readily
observed on an ECG, because the S wave becomes very large (negatively). Infarcts,
which are dead regions of the heart muscle that result from heart attacks, are also
detected on an ECG because they reflect the depolarization wave.
