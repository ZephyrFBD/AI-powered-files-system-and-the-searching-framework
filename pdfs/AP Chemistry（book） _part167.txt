n alternate form of energy, 
heat. Therefore, the potential energy stored as chemical energy 
must decrease.
(c) The amount of work done to pump the water to a height of  
75 m can be calculated using Equation 1.1:
w = F * d = (m * g) * d
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Platinum, Pt, is one of the rarest of the metals. Worldwide  
annual production is only about 130 tons. Platinum has a density 
of 21.4 g>cm3. If thieves were to steal platinum from a bank using 
a small truck with a maximum payload capacity of 900 lb, how 
many 1 L bars of the metal could they take?  
(a) 19 bars (b) 2 bars (c) 42 bars (d) 1 bar (e) 47 bars
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) Calculate the density of a 374.5-g sample of copper if it has a 
volume of 41.8 cm3. (b) A student needs 15.0 g of ethanol for an 
experiment. If the density of ethanol is 0.789 g>mL, how many 
milliliters of ethanol are needed? (c) What is the mass, in grams, 
of 25.0 mL of mercury 1density = 13.6 g>mL2?
Because a joule is not a very large amount
