Figure 2.23 Methane has a tetrahedral geometry, with each of the four hydrogen atoms spaced 109.5Â° apart.
As the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or
combinations of both. Furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and
each type of bond affects the geometry of the molecule in a specific way. This three-dimensional shape or conformation of
the large molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function.
Hydrocarbon Chains
Hydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and may be branched or unbranched.
Furthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple
covalent bonds, illustrated in Figure 2.24. The hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different
