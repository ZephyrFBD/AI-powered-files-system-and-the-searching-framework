d consequences for organisms in ponds or lakes that
freeze in the winter. The layer of ice on the surface of the lake helps protect the organisms below from
temperature extremes in the atmosphere, increasing their chances of surviving the cold winter. If ice were
denser than liquid water, the ice would sink, leaving the remaining water in the lake exposed and vulnerable to
more freezing and increasing the likelihood that the lake would freeze solid during the winter. This would
result in fewer organisms in the lake surviving the winter.
Acting as a great solvent for other polar molecules and for ions: Water has a partially positive end and a
partially negative end. Thus, water can readily dissolve ionic compounds (see Figure 3.5) and other polar
molecules. This makes water an excellent solvent for many biological molecules.

pH
pH (or “power of hydrogen”) measures the concentration of H+ ions in a solution. The formula for pH is the
