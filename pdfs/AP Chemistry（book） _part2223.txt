From Equation 14.17, we see that t1>2 for a first-order rate law does not depend on the 
initial concentration of any reactant. Consequently, the half-life remains constant through-
out the reaction. If, for example, the initial concentration of a reactant is 0.120 M it will be 
1
210.120 M2 = 0.060 M after one half-life. After one more half-life passes, 
the concentration will drop to 0.030 M, and so on. Equation 14.17 also 
indicates that, for a first-order reaction, we can calculate t1>2 if we know k 
and calculate k if we know t1>2.
The change in concentration over time for the first-order rearrange-
ment of gaseous methyl isonitrile at 199 Â°C is graphed in Figure 14.10. 
Because the concentration of this gas is directly proportional to its pressure 
during the reaction, we have chosen to plot pressure rath
