 exercise, you investigate factors that influence the rate of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can be summarized
by the following reaction.
CO2 + H2O + light → CH2O + O2
 
To determine the rate of this reaction, you can measure the disappearance of
 
CO2or the accumulation of O2. Both of these gases fill the air spaces
among the spongy mesophyll of leaves. You must consider, however, that while photosynthesis is occurring in the
leaf, some parts of the leaf may be generating energy through aerobic respiration. Thus, the gases that fill the air
spaces are being altered by a concurrent process of respiration:
CH2O + O2 → CO2 + H2O + ATP
 
Measuring O2accumulation, then, is a measurement of net photosynthetic
 
activity:
 
O2 production = gross photosynthesis – respiration = net photosynthesis
Part I: Determining the Rate of Photosynthesis
To measure the rate of net photosynthesis, you record the rate that
 
submerged pieces of leaves rise in water as O2accumulates in their air
 
spaces. Fo
