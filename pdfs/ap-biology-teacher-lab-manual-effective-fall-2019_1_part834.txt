I lies higher 
than that for Process II. This is in accord with the facts as we have seen them, namely, 
that Process I is faster and so has a greater slope or higher value for the steepness. 
Second, notice that both curves are perfectly flat. Naturally, because the progress curves 
for the two processes were both perfectly straight lines, having everywhere the same 
slope, the rate of steepness graph must show exactly the same thing, that is, that the rate 
or steepness is everywhere the same. 
On the other hand, consider the graph in Figure A.13, which represents the 
disappearance of A in yet another reaction, Process III.
