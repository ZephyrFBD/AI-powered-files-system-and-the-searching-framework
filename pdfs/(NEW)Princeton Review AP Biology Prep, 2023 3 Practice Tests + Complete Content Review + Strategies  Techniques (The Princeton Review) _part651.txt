ice (A) describes
parasitism, and (B) describes commensalism. Choice (D) is an example of altruistic behavior.
37. D
Beta cells secrete insulin. Binding of antibodies to the beta cells in the pancreas will halt the production of
insulin, which will lead to an increase in blood glucose levels. Therefore, eliminate (A), (B), and (C).
38. C
The graph does show a drought, but it says nothing about genetic variation. It is true that the rainfall could
affect evolution of the population, but the graph doesnâ€™t address evolution. It shows only the decrease in
biomass. Choice (C) is the best answer since it addresses how the environmental effects ripple through the
levels of the ecosystem. Invasive species do not need an unoccupied niche, and that is not shown in the graph.
39. A
The biomass seems to correlate fairly well with the rainfall. Therefore, a rainfall higher than any recorded
would give a biomass higher than any recorded. The axis on the right shows the biomass. With a rainfall of
