eapprove all research proposals. 
•  Students should never place research organisms in extremely stressful situations  
(e.g., high temperatures). 
•  The USDA lists cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) as a pest species. Therefore, no 
butterflies or larvae raised in the laboratory should be released to the wild. 
•  Euthanize the butterflies or larvae by freezing them when your investigation is  
complete. The plants and soil can simply be discarded.  
•  Disease outbreaks are common in cultured populations of organisms. Although 
the diseases associated with the organisms in this investigation are not dangerous 
to humans, it is important to maintain cleanliness in the laboratory and of your 
experimental equipment in order to minimize the risk of diseases impacting the 
study. 
•  Long-term culturing for plants or butterflies requires cleanliness. Be sure to clean 
all culturing chambers and wipe them down with dilute Clorox (and then dry the 
chambers completely) before starti
