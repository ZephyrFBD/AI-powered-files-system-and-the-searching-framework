iety of insects and their range of habitat and ecological influence is an example of adaptive radiation
on a grand scale. 13. A. Evolution does not occur for an individual. Only groups of individuals (of the same species)
evolve.
Grid-In Questions
1. Answer: 0.7
 
The information given in the question is summarized as follows:
 
q2 = 0.09 = white sheep (homozygous recessives)
 
p2 + 2pq = 0.91 = black sheep (homozygous dominants and heterozygotes)
 
Then, calculate the square root of q2= 0.09, using your calculator if necessary:
q = 0.3 or 30%
p = 1 − q = 0.7 (since p + q = 1)
The question asks for the frequency (not the percentage) rounded to the nearest tenth, so you should enter 0.7 into
the answer grid.
 
2. Answer: .65
 
First, add up all the individuals to find the size of the population: 169 + 182
 
+ 49 = 400. Then, p2= 169 ÷ 400 = 0.4225. Take the square root of p2to
 
find p = 0.65. Be sure to enter your answer as a percentage in decimal form into the answer grid: .65 or 0.65
