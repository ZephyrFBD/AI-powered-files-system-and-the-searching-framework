e. You must be careful not to know (or reveal) the results of the experiments, 
but rather be genuinely interested in student discoveries and conclusions. The classroom 
atmosphere should be one where students feel comfortable to observe, hypothesize, 
predict, and explore new concepts. You must consider any constraints, such as the 
following: 
•  Space: Where, when, and how will the experiment be performed? Space is often 
the limiting factor for student-directed, inquiry-based experiences, especially when 
students extend the lab and begin to ask their own questions. Determine if parts of 
the experiment can be performed outside the classroom. For example, plants can be 
grown at home and brought in for the experiment in order to save space. 
•  Experimental organism(s): The experimental organism needs to be readily available. 
For example, insects can be caught or cultured, and plants can be grown on site. Many 
classrooms have resources for mice or snakes, but be aware of regulati
