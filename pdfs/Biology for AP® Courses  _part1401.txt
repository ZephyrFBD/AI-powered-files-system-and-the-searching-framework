types with high (H), intermediate (I),
and low (L) melanosome production. Use the second grid
to represent an F2 generation from the offspring of the first
cross. Use annotation to show the phenotype.

B. Draw sister chromatids at anaphase II for both parents
in the F1 generation and annotate your drawing to identify
each genotype of the gametes using the cells of the Punnett
square.
C. Explain which of Mendel’s laws is violated by
codominance.
D. Suppose that these data were available to evaluate the
claim that the wild-type and mutant forms of SLC24A5 are
codominant:

Complete the table. Explain the values expected in terms
of the genotype of the offspring.
E. Using a c2 statistic at the 95% confidence level,
evaluate the claim that the wild-type and mutant forms of
SCLO24A5 are codominant. The definition of the statistic
