with the closest common ancestor are the BucconidaeÂ and the
Galbulidae, (B). All the other choices feature groups with less recent
common ancestors.

In the cladogram, the branch that diverges to form the Sarcopterygii
and the Actinopterygii is labeled Osteichthyes, so it is true that an
Osteichthyean was the common ancestor of those two clades. (D) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect because the Sarcopterygii branch extends
to the end of the cladogram, suggesting that members of this clade
still exist. (B) is incorrect because the Percomorpharia and the
Ovalentariae are relatively close on the cladogram, with a recent
common ancestor. (C) is incorrect because the Actinopterygii has many

more branches in the cladogram (and thus greater diversity) than the
Sarcopterygii.

Unusual traits are more likely to develop once in a common ancestor
than to develop independently on multiple occasions. Thus, it is more
