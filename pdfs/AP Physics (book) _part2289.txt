magnetic field B. The particles are
accelerated to higher speeds each time they pass through
the gap between the metal “dees,” where there is an electric
field E. (There is no electric field inside the hollow metal
dees where the electrons move in circular paths.) The 
electric field changes direction each half-cycle, owing 
to an ac voltage
so that the particles 
are increased in speed at each passage through the gap.
(a) Show that the frequency f of the voltage must be
where q is the charge on the particles and 
m their mass. (b) Show that the kinetic energy of the 
particles increases by 
each revolution, assuming that
the gap is small. (c) If the radius of the cyclotron is 2.0 m 
and the magnetic field
strength is 0.50 T, what
will be the maximum
kinetic energy of
accelerated protons
in MeV?
