2. Pharynx. When food is swallowed and passed into the throat, or pharynx, a flap of tissue, the epiglottis, blocks
the trachea so that solid and liquid material enter only the esophagus.
3. Esophagus. Food moves through the esophagus, a tube leading to the stomach, by muscular contractions called
peristalsis.
4. Stomach. The stomach secretes gastric juice, a mixture of digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid (HCl), and
serves a variety of functions, as follows:
Storage. Because of its accordion-like folds, the wall of the stomach can expand to store 2 to 4 L of material.
Mixing. The stomach mixes the food with water and gastric juice to produce a creamy medium called chyme.
Physical breakdown. Muscles churn the contents of the stomach,physically breaking food down into smaller
particles. In addition, HCl from the gastric juice denatures (or unfolds) proteins and loosens the cementing
substances between cells of the food. Also, the HCl kills most bacteria that may accompany th
