between the Cs+ and I - ions in CsI. As a result, the lattice energy 
of NaF should be greater than that of CsI. In order of increasing 
energy, therefore, we have CsI 6 NaF 6 CaO.
Check Table 8.1 confirms our predicted order is correct.

CHAPTER 8 Basic Concepts of Chemical Bonding
given type of ionic compound, lattice energy decreases as we go down a group. Figure 8.5 
illustrates this trend for the alkali chlorides MCl (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and the sodium 
halides NaX 1X = F, Cl, Br, I2.
Electron Configurations of Ions  
of the s- and p-Block Elements
The energetics of ionic bond formation helps explain why many ions tend to have 
 
noble-gas electron configurations. For example, sodium readily loses one electron to 
form Na+, which has the same electron configuration as Ne:
Na   1s22s22p63s1 = 3Ne43s1
Na+   1s22s22p6  = 3Ne4
Even though lattice energy increases with increasing ionic charge, we never find 
ionic compounds that contain Na2 +  ions. The second electron remov
