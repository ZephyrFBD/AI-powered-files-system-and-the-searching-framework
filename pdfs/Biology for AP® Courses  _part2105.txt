wn to have been very low, implying the absence
of an ozone layer to filter high-energy ultraviolet (uv)
radiation.
•
Ammonia decomposes when it absorbs high-energy
uv radiation, but diatomic nitrogen does not.
Models of the abiotic synthesis of biomolecules suffer
from a “chicken and egg” dilemma. Proteins are needed to
synthesize DNA and RNA, and DNA and RNA are needed
to synthesize proteins. Which molecules came first?
B. In light of the following observations, evaluate the
hypothesis that nucleotides arose from a prebiotic
mixture.
•
Nuclei acids are not found in experiments like those
of Miller and Urey.
•
Purines and pyrimidines decompose at high
temperature, and Earth was bombarded by meteors
and comets during the Hadean eon.
•
Bonds in the purine and pyrimidine rings of nucleic
acids are broken by high-energy uv radiation.
•
Carl Sagan and colleagues synthesized ATP from a
mixture of adenosine, ribose, and phosphate when
exposed to uv radiation.
•
Ribose has never been synthesiz
