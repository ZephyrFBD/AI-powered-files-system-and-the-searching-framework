probability of aB and the probability of ab.
AP EXPERT NOTE
The Two Laws of Mendelian Inheritance
Law of Segregation—This describes the separation of alleles in
the parent genotype during the process of gametogenesis. There
can be a maximum of only two diﬀerent alleles in a single diploid
parent; half the gametes get one allele and the other half get the
other allele.
Law of Independent Assortment—This suggests that diﬀerent
genes sort into diﬀerent gametes, independently of each other.
For example, the sorting of alleles for eye color is not aﬀected by
the sorting of alleles for hair color. These laws explain the 3 : 1 and
9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratios of phenotypes observed in monohybrid and
dihybrid crosses.
Once you can figure out what gametes will be produced from which
individuals, you can figure out the genotypes of oﬀspring from a Punnett
square. The following is a simple cross between two hete
