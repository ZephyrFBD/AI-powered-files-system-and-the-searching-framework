†Differences in the final digit can depend on whether you keep all digits in your calculator for v
(which gives  
), or if you use  
(which gives  
). Both results
are valid since our assumed accuracy is about 
(see Section 1–4).

In uniform circular motion, the speed is
constant, but the acceleration is not zero
Moon’s centripetal acceleration. The Moon’s nearly circu-
lar orbit around the Earth has a radius of about 384,000 km and a period T of
27.3 days. Determine the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth.
APPROACH Again we need to find the velocity v in order to find 
SOLUTION In one orbit around the Earth, the Moon travels a distance 
where
