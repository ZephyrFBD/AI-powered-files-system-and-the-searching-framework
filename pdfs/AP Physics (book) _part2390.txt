s law: a coil
of wire is made to rotate uniformly by mechanical means in a
magnetic field, and the changing flux through the coil induces
a sinusoidal current, which is the output of the generator.

Summary
A motor, which operates in the reverse of a generator, acts
like a generator in that a back emf is induced in its rotating coil.
Because this back emf opposes the input voltage, it can act to
limit the current in a motor coil. Similarly, a generator acts
somewhat like a motor in that a counter torque acts on its
rotating coil.
A transformer, which is a device to change the magnitude
of an ac voltage, consists of a primary coil and a secondary coil.
The changing flux due to an ac voltage in the primary coil
induces an ac voltage in the secondary coil. In a 100% efficient
transformer, the ratio of output to input voltages 
equals the ratio of the number of turns 
in the secondary to
the number 
in the primary:
