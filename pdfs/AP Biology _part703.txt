 cell membrane through “leak channels” in resting neurons. In
order for the nerve to fire, a stimulus must be strong enough to overcome
the resting threshold or resting potential. The larger the resting
potential, the stronger the stimulus must be to cause the nerve to fire.

Gated Channels
Neurons have gated ion channels that open or close in response to a
stimulus and play an essential role in the transmission of electrical
impulses. These channels allow only one kind of ion, such as sodium or
potassium, to flow through them. If a stimulus triggers a sodium ion gated
channel to open, sodium ions flow into the cytoplasm, resulting in a
decrease in polarization to about –60 mV (from –70 mV). The membrane
becomes somewhat depolarized, so it is easier for the nerve to fire. In
contrast, if a potassium ion gated channel is stimulated, the membrane
potential increases and the membrane becomes hyperpolarized, to about –
75 mV, so that it is harder
