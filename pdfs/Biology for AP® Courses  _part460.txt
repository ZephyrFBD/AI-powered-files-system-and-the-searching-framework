 occurs when the endoplasmic
reticula of cardiac muscle cells do not function properly. As a result, an insufficient number of calcium ions
are available to trigger a sufficient contractile force.
Cardiologists (cardi- = “heart”; -ologist = “one who studies”) are doctors who specialize in treating heart
diseases, including heart failure. Cardiologists can make a diagnosis of heart failure via physical

We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the
vesicles go? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport
