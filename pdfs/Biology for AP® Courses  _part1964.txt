ation of favorable traits in succeeding generations. Thus, evolution by natural selection explains both the unity
and diversity of life.
Convergent evolution occurs when similar traits with the same function evolve in multiple species exposed to similar
selection pressure, such as the wings of bats and insects. In divergent evolution, two species evolve in different directions
from a common point, such as the forelimbs of humans, dogs, birds, and whales. Although Darwinâ€™s theory was
revolutionary for its time because it contrasted with long-held ideas (for example, Lamarck proposed the inheritance of
acquired characteristics), evidence drawn from many scientific disciplines, including the fossil record, the existence of
homologous and vestigial structures, mathematics, and DNA analysis supports evolution through natural selection. It is
also important to understand that evolution continues to occur; for example, bacteria that evolve resistance to antibiotics or
plants that become resis
