14–2 Internal Energy
The sum total of all the energy of all the molecules in an object is called its 
internal energy. (Sometimes thermal energy is used to mean the same thing.) We
introduce the concept of internal energy now since it will help clarify ideas about heat.
Distinguishing Temperature, Heat, and Internal Energy
Using the kinetic theory, we can make a clear distinction between temperature,
heat, and internal energy. Temperature (in kelvins) is a measure of the average
kinetic energy of individual molecules (Eq. 13–8). Internal energy refers to the
total energy of all the molecules within the object. (Thus two equal-mass hot ingots of
iron may have the same temperature, but two of them have twice as much internal
energy as one does.) Heat, finall
