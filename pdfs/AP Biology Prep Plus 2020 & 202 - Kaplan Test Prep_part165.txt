mitosis and meiosis. Eukaryotes include protists, fungi, plants,
and animals. These cells are large and move via a variety of
methods including flagella and cilia.
3.
Cell membranes are made up of a lipid bilayer that includes a
hydrophobic and a hydrophilic region. Specific structures
embedded within the membrane help to facilitate transport.
4.
The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning it allows
certain things through while keeping others out. Water diﬀuses
across the membrane from areas of lesser to greater solute
concentration (osmosis). While certain things can cross the
membrane in the processes of diﬀusion or facilitated diﬀusion,

which do not require energy, others require the expenditure of
energy for active transport against the concentration gradient.
