ove the first elec-
tron from a neutral atom. For example, the first ionization energy for the sodium atom is 
the energy required for the process
 
Na1g2 ยก Na+1g2 + e- 
[7.2]
The second ionization energy, I2, is the energy needed to remove the second electron, 
and so forth, for successive removals of additional electrons. Thus, I2 for the sodium atom 
is the energy associated with the process
 
Na+1g2 ยก Na2+1g2 + e- 
[7.3]
Variations in Successive Ionization Energies
The magnitude of the ionization energy tells us how much energy is required to remove 
an electron; the greater the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an elec-
tron. Notice in Table 7.2 that ionization energies for a given element increase as succes-
sive electrons are removed: I1 6 I2 6 I3, and so forth. This trend makes sense because 
with each successive removal, an electron is being pulled away from an increasingly pos-
itive ion, requiring increasingly more energy.
