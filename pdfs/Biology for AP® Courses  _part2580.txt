fy the claim of the third model by i) rejecting the
two alternative claims, using the fact that growth rate
depends on the availability of resources and considering
that regulation of expression at a critical volume would
require measurement of total volume by the cell, and ii)
arguing that adding a constant volume before each cell
division would narrow the cell size distribution.
B. Design a plan to test both the most recent model and
the timer model.
79. Gram-negative bacteria have an inner cytoplasmic
membrane separated by a peptidoglycan layer from a
second outer membrane. In addition, transport proteins
called efflux pumps span this double membrane and
actively eliminate chemicals such as antibiotics that pass
through porins on the outer membrane. These efflux
pumps can confer multi-drug resistance, a situation that is
threatening human health.
A. Explain how combining a drug that disrupts ATP
synthesis in bacteria with antibiotics is a possible strategy
for the treatment of bacte
