The otters were then protected by the international fur seal treaty, which banned sea otter hunting. The sea otter 
population has rebounded to nearly three thousand individuals today. 
Otters live in kelp forests and eelgrass beds and feed on crabs and shellfish (Figure 1). Most herbivores in the 
habitat eat algae that grows on the eelgrass and not the eelgrass itself. If there is too much algae, the eelgrass does 
not receive enough light for photosynthesis. As the otter population has increased, the eelgrass habitat has increased.

Recently, however, scientists have noticed the presence of two nonnative, predatory invertebrate species that may be 
colonizing the Elkhorn Slough, which would have been too cold for them three decades ago. Scientists have also 
observed that otters in the area are experiencing increased mortality because of an increase in harmful algal blooms, 
which occur as
