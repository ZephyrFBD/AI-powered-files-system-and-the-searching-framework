∣ Resonance Structures
We sometimes encounter molecules and ions in which the experimentally deter-
mined arrangement of atoms is not adequately described by a single dominant Lewis struc-
ture. Consider ozone, O3, which is a bent molecule with two equal O ¬O bond lengths

electronegative than C or S. Therefore, we expect any neg-
ative formal charge to reside on the N atom (guideline 2). 
For these two reasons, the middle Lewis structure is the 
dominant one for NCS-.
double bonds should you draw in the Lewis structure?
(a) 0 (b) 1 (c) 2 (d) 3 (e) 4
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The cyanate ion, NCO-, has three possible Lewis structures.  
(a) Draw these three structures and assign formal charges in 
each. (b) Which Lewis structure is dominant?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The sulfate ion, SO4 2-, can be drawn in many ways. If you 
minimize formal charge on the sulfur, how many S “ O
