 nucleotides over
and over again (Figure 9-3). This allows elongation of the lagging strand to continue and prevents the loss of DNA
in replicated chromosomes. Telomerase is active in young cells, but its activity declines as the cell ages, eventually
ceasing activity in most cells. Once telomerase activity stops, the chromosome becomes shorter with each
replication event and eventually important DNA at the end of the chromosome is lost, resulting in nonviable
daughter cells. The loss of telomerase activity has been implicated in the aging of cells.

DNA Repair
DNA replication is not perfect. Errors happen. Various mechanisms, however, are present to repair the errors,
including the following:
1. Proofreading of a newly attached base to the growing replicate strand is carried out by DNA polymerase. DNA
polymerase checks to make sure that each newly added nucleotide correctly base-pairs with the template strand. If it
does not, the nucleotide is removed and replaced with the c
