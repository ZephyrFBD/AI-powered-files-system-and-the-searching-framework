Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use energy from sunlight to make sugar.
In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, electrons are passed down a chain, and
the energy molecules ATP and NADPH are produced. Water is also split into hydrogen and oxygen.
In the light-independent reactions, sugar is made in the Calvin-Benson Cycle (Calvin cycle) by using energy
from ATP and NADPH, and the carbon from CO2.
Cellular respiration consumes oxygen and produces a lot of ATP energy for the cell, using NADH and FADH2
as electron carriers. There are four stages to cellular respiration:
glycolysis
formation of acetyl-CoA via the PDC
Krebs cycle
oxidative phosphorylation
Anaerobic respiration occurs when cells lack oxygen to act as a final electron acceptor. In this process, the
pyruvates generated by glycolysis are broken down by fermentation to produce lactic acid or ethanol and NAD+,
which permits glycolysis to continue and provide the 2 ATP it mak
