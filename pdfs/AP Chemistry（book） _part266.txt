he returned to England as a faculty member at Manchester University, where he did his 
famous a-particle scattering experiments, described below.
Rutherford showed that the paths of a and b radiation are bent by an electric field, 
although in opposite directions; while g radiation is unaffected by the field (Figure 2.7). 
 
From this finding he concluded that a and b rays consist of fast-moving electrically 
charged particles. In fact, b  
particles are nothing more than high-speed electrons that 
can be considered the radioactive equivalent of cathode rays. Because of their negative 
 
charge, they are attracted to a positively charged plate. The a particles have a positive 
charge and are attracted to a negative plate. In units of the charge of the  
electron, 
 
b  
particles have a charge of 1- and a particles a charge of 2+. Each a particle has a mass 
about 7400 times that of an electron. Gamma radiation is high-energy el
