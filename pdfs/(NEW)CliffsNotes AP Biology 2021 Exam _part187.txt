s can be coordinated to
produce a single cellular response.
Following are descriptions for four kinds of receptor proteins—three membrane receptors and one intracellular
receptor—and the signal transduction pathways they initiate. Table 6-1 summarizes the descriptions. You should be
prepared to describe at least one of these receptor proteins in detail in a free-response question on the AP exam. In
other cases, questions may provide you with a full description of a pathway and ask you to use the descriptions to
make conclusions. Familiarity with all four kinds of receptor proteins will work in your favor.
Also note that some of the examples of these pathways are pursued in more detail in subsequent chapters.

Gated Ion Receptors
A gated ion receptor is a transmembrane protein that contains a gated channel, that is, a channel that opens and
closes in response to a specific signal. When open, the channel allows a specific ion to pass through. A ligand-gated
ion receptor responds
