 deuterium per 80 L of water). The simple proton–proton
reaction of Eq. 31–6a, which could use a much more plentiful source of fuel,
has such a small probability of occurring that it cannot be considered a possi-
bility on Earth.
Although a useful fusion reactor has not yet been achieved, considerable
progress has been made in overcoming the inherent difficulties. The problems are
associated with the fact that all nuclei have a positive charge and repel each other.
However, if they can be brought close enough together so that the short-range
attractive strong nuclear force can come into play, it can pull the nuclei together
and fusion can occur. For the nuclei to get close enough together, they must have
large kinetic energy to overcome the electric repulsion. High kinetic energies are
readily attainable with particle accelerators (Chapter 32), but the number of parti-
cles involved is too small. To produce realistic amounts of energy, we must deal
with matter in bulk, for which high k
