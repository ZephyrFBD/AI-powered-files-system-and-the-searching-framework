ed would increase until
the back emf equaled the input voltage. When there is a mechanical load, the speed
of the motor may be limited also by the load. The back emf will then be less than
the external applied voltage. The greater the mechanical load, the slower the motor
rotates and the lower is the back emf (
Eq. 21–5).
e r v,
Back emf in a motor. The armature windings of a dc motor
have a resistance of 
The motor is connected to a 120-V line, and when the
motor reaches full speed against its normal load, the back emf is 108 V. Calculate
(a) the current into the motor when it is just starting up, and (b) the current when
the motor reaches full speed.
APPROACH As the motor is just starting up, it is turning very slowly, so there
is negligible back emf. The only voltage is the 120-V line. The current is given by
Ohm’s law with 
At full speed, we must include as emfs both the 120-V
applied emf and the opposing back emf.
SOLUTION (a) At start up, the current is controlled by the 120 V ap
