The Ogallala Aquifer, also referred to as the High 
Plains Aquifer, is an enormous underground body 
of water lying beneath the Great Plains of the 
United States. One of the world’s largest aquifers, 
it covers an area of approximately 450,000 km2
1170,000 mi22 encompassing portions of eight 
states: South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colo-
rado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. 
(Figure 18.18). The water-saturated depth of the 
underground aquifer ranges from as little as 1 m to 
more than 300 m. The total volume of water stored 
in the aquifer is more than that of Lake Huron.
Anyone who has ﬂown over the Great Plains 
is familiar with the view of huge circles made by 
the center pivot irrigators nearly covering the land. 
The center post irrigation system, developed in the 
post–World War II era, permitted application of 
water onto large areas. As a result, the Great Plains 
became one of the most produ
