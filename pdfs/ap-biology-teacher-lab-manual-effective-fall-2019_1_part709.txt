 processes help plants regulate the 
amount of water lost through transpiration? How do plants maintain the balance 
between the transport of CO2 and O2 and the amount of water lost through 
transpiration?

You will then design an experiment to investigate one of these questions or a question of 
your own. As a supplemental activity, you can examine microscopically thin sections of 
stems, identify xylem and phloem cells, and relate the function of these vascular tissues 
to observations made about the structure of these cells. 
The investigation also provides an opportunity for you to apply and review concepts 
you have studied previously, including the relationship between cell structure and 
function; osmosis, diffusion, and active transport; the movement of molecules and ions 
across cell membranes; the physical and chemical properties of water; photosynthesis; 
and the exchange of matter between biological systems an
