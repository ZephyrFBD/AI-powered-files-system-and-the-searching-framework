capture its grandeur as well as this

To make an accurate analysis of a stone arch is quite difficult in practice.
But if we make some simplifying assumptions, we can show why the horizontal
component of the force at the base is less for a pointed arch than for a round 
one. Figure 9â€“31 shows a round arch and a pointed arch, each with an 8.0-m
span. The height of the round arch is thus 4.0 m, whereas that of the pointed arch
is larger and has been chosen to be 8.0 m. Each arch supports a weight of
which, for simplicity, we have divided into two
parts (each
) acting on the two halves of each arch as shown. To be in
equilibrium, each of the supports must exert an upward force of 
For
rotational equilibrium, each support also exerts a horizontal force,
at the
base of the arch, and it is this we want to calculate. We focus only on the right half
of each arch. We set equal to zero the total torque calculated about
