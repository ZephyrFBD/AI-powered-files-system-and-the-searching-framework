’s the enzyme activity—the thing that’s affected by pH. Let’s label the y-axis
“Rate of Reaction.” Now we’re ready to plot the values on the graph. Based on our knowledge of enzymes, we know
that for most enzymes the functional range of pH is narrow, with optimal performance occurring at or around a pH
of 7.
Now you should interpret your graph. If the pH level decreases from a neutral pH of 7, the reaction rate of the
enzyme will decrease. If the pH level increases, the rate of reaction will also decrease. Don’t forget to include a
simple explanation of your graph.
Additional quantitative and graphing skills will be discussed at length in a later chapter of this text. There you will
learn how to include statistics and hypothesis testing in your free-response questions and how best to present data
using graphs.
UNDERSTAND CONTROL GROUPS IN EXPERIMENTS
Almost every experiment will have at least one group that represents the normal/unchanged/neutral version of the
independent variable. Th
