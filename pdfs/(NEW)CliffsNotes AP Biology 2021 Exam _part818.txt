5. A statistical analysis. If an analysis is not requested in the question,
you should still suggest an appropriate analysis (e.g., χ2).
Investigation 13: Enzyme Catalysis
In this investigation, the effect of a catalyst on the rate of a reaction is measured. The reaction investigated is the
breakdown of hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) into H2O and O2. Two kinds of enzymes catalyze the decomposition of H2O2—catalase and peroxidase.
Catalase decomposes H2O2directly, whereas peroxidase decomposes H2O2using an organic
reducing agent. These reactions are compared in the first two equations below. The letter A represents the organic
substance.
 
One option in this investigation is to use peroxidase with the organic
 
reducing agent guaiacol. In the presence of peroxidase, H2O2is broken down to H2O as four molecules of guaiacol
are converted to tetraguaiacol
(third equation above). Because guaiacol is colorless and tetraguaiacol is orange-brown, the amount of product
produced can be m
