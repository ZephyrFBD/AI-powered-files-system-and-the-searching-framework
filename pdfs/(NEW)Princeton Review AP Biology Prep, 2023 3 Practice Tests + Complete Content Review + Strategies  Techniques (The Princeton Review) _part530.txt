ructure. By binding outside the active site, it must be an allosteric inhibitor, eliminating (A) and (C). Because
the inhibitor is binding outside the active site, it is not competing with the substrate for binding, so it is
considered a noncompetitive inhibitor.

Enzymes are biological catalysts, which lower the activation energy (the energy threshold that must be met to
proceed from reactant to product). The reaction coordinate diagram must reflect a decrease in the activation
energy, eliminating (C). Furthermore, the enzyme does not alter the energy of the reactants or products,
eliminating (A) and (D).

B
Based on the pathway provided, consumption of one glucose and two ATP results in production of four ATP.
In other words, each glucose results in a net gain of two ATP. Therefore, two glucose molecules would result
in a net gain of four ATP.

In fermentation, pyruvic acid is converted into either ethanol or lactic acid. During this process, NADH is
recycled into NAD+.
