e your teacher check your design. When 
you have an approved design, run your experiment and record your results. Do your 
experimental results support your predictions? 
■ Procedure 2: Modeling Diffusion and Osmosis 
You are in the hospital and need intravenous fluids. You read the label on the IV bag, 
which lists all of the solutes in the water. 
•  Why is it important for an IV solution to have salts in it? 
•  What would happen if you were given pure water in an IV? 
•  How would you determine the best concentration of solutes to give a patient in need 
of fluids before you introduced the fluids into the patient’s body? 
In this experiment, you will create models of living cells using dialysis tubing. Like 
cell membranes, dialysis tubing is made from a material that is selectively permeable 
to water and some solutes. You will fill your model cells with different solutions and 
determine the rate of diffusion.
