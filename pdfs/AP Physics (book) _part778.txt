Problem 62.
*63. (II) A 52-kg woman and a 72-kg man stand 10.0 m apart on
nearly frictionless ice. (a) How far from the woman is their CM?
(b) If each holds one end of a rope, and the man pulls on 
the rope so that he moves 2.5 m, how far from the woman
will he be now? (c) How far will the man have moved when
he collides with the woman?
