sum of the individual probabilities. So the frequency of heterozygotes would be the sum of these
two events pq + pq = 2pq.
Practice with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
Now try some practice problems.
1. In cats, long hair is recessive to short hair. A large, randomly mating population of cats is in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. In this population, 32% of the cats have long hair. What percentage of the population are
heterozygous for short hair?
Start with the recessive phenotype, long hair, whose frequency is equal to q2: q2 = 0.32. Taking the square
root of both sides of the equation gives you q = 0.57. Since the sum of p and q equals 1, p = 1 – q = 1 – 0.57
= 0.43. The frequency of heterozygotes equals 2pq, so the heterozygotes = 2(0.43)(0.57) = 0.49 = 49%.
2. In pigs, erect ears are dominant to drooping ears. In a pig population that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
82% of the individuals have erect ears. What is the frequency of heterozygotes in this population?
Since there are two geno
