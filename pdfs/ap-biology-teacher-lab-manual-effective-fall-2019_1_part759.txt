the 
fruit flies in Figure 2. Can you identify which ones are female and which ones are male?  
Focus on the abdomen of the flies to note differences.

Step 1 Using fruit fly cultures, carefully toss 10 to 20 living flies into an empty vial. Be sure 
to plug the vial as soon as you add the flies. Do not anesthetize the flies before this or any 
of the behavior experiments. 
Step 2 When flies are tossed, they are tapped into an empty vial. Tap a culture vial (push 
the vial down on a solid surface several times) on the table to move the flies to the 
bottom of the vial. Quickly remove the foam or cotton top and invert an empty vial over 
the top of the culture vial. Invert the vials so that the culture vial is on the top and the 
empty vial is on the bottom, and tap the flies into the empty container by tapping it on 
a solid surface several times. Be sure to hold the vials tightly to keep them together. Y
