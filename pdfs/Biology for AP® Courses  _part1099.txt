ligand. When k is small, the likelihood of binding is low,
even when the concentration of ligand is high. To initiate a
new stimulus response cycle for the receptor, the ligand
must dissociate. Larger values of k mean that the receptor
is more likely to be occupied and thus unavailable to bind
another ligand.
Some ligand-binding systems have multiple binding sites.
For example, hemoglobin binds four oxygen molecules,
whereas myoglobin has only a single binding site. When
multiple binding sites are present, the presence of an
already-bound ligand can cooperatively affect the binding
of other ligands on the same protein. For hemoglobin, the
binding is positively cooperative. The affinity of oxygen
for heme increases as the number of bound oxygen
molecules increases.
A.
Describe the features in the graph above for
hemoglobin that demonstrate positive
cooperativity.
B.
The insulin receptor (IR) is a tyrosine kinase
receptor that has two sites to which insulin can
attach. IR is negatively c
