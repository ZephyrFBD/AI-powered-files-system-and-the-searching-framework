Starch and glycogen are more similar in structure than either is to
cellulose. Humans do not have the necessary enzyme to break the
bonds connecting glucose molecules in cellulose, even though some
organisms do have these enzymes. (A) is thus correct. (B) is incorrect
because the glucose monomers are identical in all three polymers. (C)
is incorrect because some herbivorous mammals (e.g., cows, horses,
and goats) are capable of digesting cellulose, due to the symbiotic
bacteria that inhabit their digestive tracts. (D) is incorrect because
cellulose does not have more associated water molecules than other
glucose polymers and because it is not necessarily larger than the
others.
