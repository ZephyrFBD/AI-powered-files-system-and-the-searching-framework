linear, causing the overall molecule to be linear.
 
Plan To determine the polarity of the molecule, we must ex-
amine the polarity of the individual bonds and the overall 
geometry of the molecule.
Solve Because the molecule is linear, we expect the two dipoles 
created by the polarity in the carbonâ€“nitrogen bond to cancel 
each other, leaving the molecule with no dipole moment.

CHARACTERISTICS OF GASES (SECTION 10.1) Substances that 
are gases at room temperature tend to be molecular substances with 
low molar masses. Air, a mixture composed mainly of N2 and O2, is 
the most common gas we encounter. Some liquids and solids can also 
exist in the gaseous state, where they are known as vapors. Gases are 
compressible; they mix in all proportions because their component 
molecules are far apart from each other.
PRESSURE (SECTION 10.2) To describe the state or condition of a gas, 
we must specify four variables: pressure (P), volume (V), tempera
