up for this cladogram. Species 1 does not possess any of the characters (A,
B, C, and D) that differentiate species 2, 3, 4, and 5. Thus, species 1 is the least closely related to the other species in
the cladogram, and assumed to be the most ancestral species. As a result, species 1 is the outgroup. The remaining
members of the cladogram, the ingroup, are the subject of the analysis.
9. D. Of all the answer choices, the two species in choice D, species 4 and 5, are the most closely related because
they have the greatest number of shared characters. They have three shared charactersâ€”A, B, and C. Species 1 and
3 have no shared characters, species 2 and 5 have 1 shared character (character A), and species 3 and 5 have two
shared characters (characters A and B). Furthermore, species 4 and 5 differ by only 1 character, whereas species 1
and 3 differ by 2 (A and B), species 2 and 5 differ by 3 (B, C, and D), and species 3 and 5 differ by 2 (C and D).
10. D. The cladogram indicates that spec
