ylation describes the transfer of electrons from
 
NADH and FADH2 to electron acceptors that pump H+ across the inner
 
mitochondrial membrane. Oxygen is required as the final electron
 
acceptor of these electrons. However, no CO2 is involved. In contrast, all the remaining answer choices describe
processes that release CO2. Note that answer choices B and D describe the same process.
Grid-In Question
1. Answer: −3.3
For the overall reaction, Δ G is the sum of the ΔG values of both reactions, or 4.0 + (−7.3) = −3.3 kcal/mol. The
negative sign is important—it indicates that, together, the coupled reactions are exergonic and that the reaction is
spontaneous.

Questions
1. In the absence of O2, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation
cannot proceed and NADH accumulates. As a result, there is no NAD+ available for glycolysis. Fermentation
regenerates NAD+ from NADH, and this NAD+ can be used in glycolysis to generate ATP.
2. The two
