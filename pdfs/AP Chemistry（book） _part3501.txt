 in studying reactions of compounds containing 
hydrogen. A compound is “labeled” by replacing one or more ordinary hydrogen atoms 
with deuterium or tritium at specific locations in a molecule. By comparing the loca-
tions of the label atoms in reactants and products, the reaction mechanism can often be 
inferred. When methyl alcohol 1CH3OH2 is placed in D2O, for example, the H atom of the 
O ¬H bond exchanges rapidly with the D atoms, forming CH3OD. The H atoms of the 
CH3 group do not exchange. This experiment demonstrates the kinetic stability of C ¬H 
bonds and reveals the speed at which the O ¬H bond in the molecule breaks and re-forms.
Properties of Hydrogen
Hydrogen is the only element that is not a member of any family in the periodic table. 
Because of its ls1 electron configuration, it is generally placed above lithium in the table. 
However, it is definitely not an alkali metal. It forms a positive ion much less readily than 
any alkali metal. The ionization energy of the h
