and without the protozoa, it would not be able to
obtain energy from its food (cellulose from the wood it chews and eats). The protozoa and the bacterial symbionts benefit
by having a protective environment and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite. Lichens
have a mutualistic relationship between fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria (Figure 36.27b). As these symbionts
grow together, the glucose produced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure
of the lichen protects the algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae.

Figure 36.27 (a) Termites form a mutualistic relationship with symbiotic protozoa in their guts, which allow both
organisms to obtain energy from the cellulose the termite consumes. (b) Lichen is a fungus that has symbiotic
photosynthetic algae living inside its cells. (credit a: modification of work by Scott Bauer, USDA; credit b:
