linked by peptide bonds
long chain of monosaccharides; may be branched or unbranched
linear sequence of amino acids in a protein
biological macromolecule composed of one or more chains of amino acids
type of nitrogenous base in DNA and RNA; adenine and guanine are purines
type of nitrogenous base in DNA and RNA; cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines
association of discrete polypeptide subunits in a protein
single-stranded, often internally base paired, molecule that is involved in protein synthesis
RNA that ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes during protein
synthesis and catalyzes the formation of the peptide linkage
long-chain of hydrocarbon with single covalent bonds in the carbon chain; the number of hydrogen
atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized
regular structure formed by proteins by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxygen
atom of one amino acid residue and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom of another amino acid resid
