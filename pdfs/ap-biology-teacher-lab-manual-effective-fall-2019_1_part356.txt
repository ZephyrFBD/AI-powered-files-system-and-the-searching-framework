 do 
accurately by oneself but relatively easy to do and much more precise with a digital video 
camera or a group of students). In this case, a PAR meter was used to measure PAR flux, 
and a shop light with an 8-inch reflector and a 100-watt equivalent compact fluorescent 
bulb created the light source. Since the rise of each disk was measured (not the
method), an estimated Standard Error could be calculated, although the reciprocal of 
time for each leaf disk to rise was still plotted. 
There is one data point that was excluded — for very bright light (>1,000 micromoles 
per square meter per second). The disks were so close to the bulb that the temperature of 
the water rose, affecting the results. To avoid this problem, consider introducing the idea 
of a water heat filter to students investigating similar variables. 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Once students have mastered the floating disk technique, they will design an experiment 
to test another variabl
