Includes heterotrophs and autotrophs
Ameba and paramecium are heterotrophs
Euglena are primarily autotrophic with red eyespots and
chlorophyll to carry out photosynthesis
Protozoans like ameba and paramecium are classified by how
they move
Mobility by varied methods: ameba—pseudopods; paramecium
—cilia; euglena—flagella
Some carry out conjugation, a primitive form of sexual
reproduction
Some cause serious diseases like amebic-dysentery an
