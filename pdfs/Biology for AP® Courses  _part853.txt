 of long-term energy storage in animals. Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids.
Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need. Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the
glucose catabolism pathways. Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which continues through glycolysis.
Fatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation that takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts
their fatty acid chains into two carbon units of acetyl groups. The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA
that proceeds into the citric acid cycle.
