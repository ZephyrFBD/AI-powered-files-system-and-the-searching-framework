 1.93  You are assigned the task of separating a desired granular ma-
terial with a density of 3.62 g>cm3 from an undesired granu-
lar material that has a density of 2.04 g>cm3. You want to do 
this by shaking the mixture in a liquid in which the heavier 
material will fall to the bottom and the lighter material will 
float. A solid will float on any liquid that is more dense. Using 
an Internet-based source or a handbook of chemistry, find 
the densities of the following substances: carbon tetrachlo-
ride, hexane, benzene, and diiodomethane. Which of these 
liquids will serve your purpose, assuming no chemical in-
teraction takes place between the liquid and the solids?
