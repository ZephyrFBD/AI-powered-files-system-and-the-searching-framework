ains ribosomes,
tRNAs, amino acids, enzymes, and translation factors. She isolates
several types of macromolecules from pancreatic cells and
incubates them with the wheat germ extract.
Based on this information, the insulin will only be produced when
DNA from pancreatic cells is added to the mixture
(A)
ribosomes from pancreatic cells are added to the mixture
(B)
mRNA from pancreatic cells is added to the mixture
(C)
both DNA and mRNA from pancreatic cells are added to the
mixture
(D)
4. Several point mutations in a DNA sequence changed the mRNA
transcript encoded by a gene as shown below.
Original sequence:
