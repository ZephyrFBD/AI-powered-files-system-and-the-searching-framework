These are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the Red List. The list is not complete, but it describes 380
extinct species of vertebrates after 1500 AD, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing.
Estimates of Present-Time Extinction Rates
Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation.
The extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some
other way. But there are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are
undescribed.
The background extinction rate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (E/MSY). For example, assuming
there are about ten million species in existenc
