 forces like the normal force and friction, are today
considered to be due to the electromagnetic force acting at the atomic level. For
example, the force your fingers exert on a pencil is the result of electrical repulsion
between the outer electrons of the atoms of your finger and those of the pencil.

FIGURE 5;34 Question 10.
An object moving in a circle of radius r with constant speed v is
said to be in uniform circular motion. It has a radial acceleration
that is directed radially toward the center of the circle (also
called centripetal acceleration), and has magnitude
(5;1)
The velocity vector and the acceleration vector 
are continu-
ally changing in direction, but are perpendicular to each other
at each moment.
A force is needed to keep an object revolving in a circle,
and the direction of this force is toward the center of the circle.
This force could be due to gravity (as for the Moon), to tension
in a cor
