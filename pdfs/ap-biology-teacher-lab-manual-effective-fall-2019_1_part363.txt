ir spaces of the spongy mesophyll, and the leaf disk will once again become buoyant 
and rise in a column of water. Therefore, the rate of photosynthesis can be indirectly 
measured by the rate of rise of the leaf disks. However, there’s more going on in the leaf 
than that! You must also remember that cellular respiration is taking place at the same 
time as photosynthesis in plant leaves. (Remember that plant cells have mitochondria, 
too!) What else could be going on that might affect this process? Aerobic respiration 
will consume oxygen that has accumulated in spongy mesophyll. Consequently, the 
two processes counter each other with respect to the accumulation of oxygen in the 
air spaces of the spongy mesophyll. So now you have a more robust measurement tool 
— the buoyancy of the leaf disks is actually an indirect measurement of the net rate of 
photosynthesis occurring in the leaf tissue.
