As in Example 3–6,
SOLUTION With
and
(see Example 3–6), we use
the y version of Eq. 2–11b with
and obtain
We rearrange this equation into standard form
so we can
use the quadratic formula:
The quadratic formula (Appendix A–4) gives
The second solution would correspond to a time prior to the kick, so it doesn’t
apply. With
for the time at which the ball touches the ground, the
horizontal distance the ball traveled is (using
from Example 3–6):
Our assumption in Example 3–6 that the ball leaves the foot at ground level
would result in an underestimate of about 1.3 m in the distance our punt traveled.
x = vx 0t = (16.0 ms)(2.53 s) = 40.5 m.
