energy of the system (negative ∆E).
We can use these ideas to write a useful algebraic expression of the first law of ther-
modynamics. When a system undergoes any chemical or physical change, the accompa-
nying change in internal energy, ∆E, is the sum of the heat added to or liberated from the 
system, q, and the work done on or by the system, w:
 
∆E = q + w 
[5.4]
When heat is added to a system or work is done on a system, its internal energy increases. There-
fore, when heat is transferred to the system from the surroundings, q has a positive value. 
Adding heat to the system is like making a deposit to the energy account—the energy of 
the system increases (Figure 5.7). Likewise, when work is done on the system by the sur-
roundings, w has a positive value. Conversely, both the heat lost by the system to the sur-
roundings and the work done by the system on the surroundings have negative values; 
that is, they lower the internal energy of the system. They are energy withdrawals a
