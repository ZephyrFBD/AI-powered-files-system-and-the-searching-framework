m mechanics.
Although we won’t go into the detailed mathematics of quantum mechanics,
we will discuss the main ideas and how they involve the wave and particle
properties of matter to explain atomic structure and other applications.
28–2 The Wave Function and Its
Interpretation; the Double-Slit Experiment
The important properties of any wave are its wavelength, frequency, and ampli-
tude. For an electromagnetic wave, the frequency (or wavelength) determines
whether the light is in the visible spectrum or not, and if so, what color it is. We
also have seen that the frequency is a measure of the energy of the corresponding
photon,
(Eq. 27–4). The amplitude or displacement of an electromagnetic
wave at any point is the strength of the electric (or magnetic) field at that point,
and is related to the intensity of the wave (the brightness of the light).
