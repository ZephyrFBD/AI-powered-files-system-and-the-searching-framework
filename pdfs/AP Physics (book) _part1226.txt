er a time , each 
part of the wave (indeed, the whole wave “shape”) has moved to the right a dis-
tance v . Figure 11–48 shows the wave at
as a solid curve, and at a later
time as a dashed curve. Consider any point on the wave at
say, a crest 
at some position x. After a time , that crest will have traveled a distance v , so 
its new position is a distance v greater than its old position. To describe this 
crest (or other point on the wave shape), the argument of the sine function must
have the same numerical value, so we replace x in Eq. 11–21 by
(11;22)
Said another way, if you are on a crest, as increases, x must increase at the same
rate so that
remains constant.
For a wave traveling along the x axis to the left, toward decreasing values of x,
v becomes
