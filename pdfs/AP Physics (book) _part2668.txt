†Depending on the total number of slits, there may or may not be complete cancellation for such an
angle, so there will be very tiny peaks between the main maxima (see Fig. 24–25b), but they are usually
much too small to be seen.
If white light strikes a grating, the central 
maximum will be a sharp
white line. But for all other orders, there will be a distinct spectrum of colors spread
out over a certain angular width, F
