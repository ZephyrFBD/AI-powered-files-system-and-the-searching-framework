rats
had food available on the third day and every day thereafter. The results were that the control rats, Group I, learned quickly,
and figured out how to run the maze in seven days. Group III did not learn much during the three days without food, but
rapidly caught up to the control group when given the food reward. Group II learned very slowly for the six days with no
reward to motivate them, and they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it
took two days longer to learn the maze.
Figure 36.43 Group I (the green solid line) found food at the end of each trial, group II (the blue dashed line) did not
find food for the first 6 days, and group III (the red dotted line) did not find food during runs on the first three days.
Notice that rats given food earlier learned faster and eventually caught up to the control group. The orange dots on the
group II and III lines show the days when food rewards were added to the mazes.
