r /s. For example, a frequency 
of 698 megahertz (MHz), a typical frequency for a cellular telephone, could be written 
as 698 MHz, 698,000,000 Hz, 698,000,000 s - 1, or 698,000,000>s.

▲ Figure 6.1 Water waves. The movement 
of a boat through the water forms waves. 
The regular variation of peaks and troughs 
enables us to sense the motion of the waves 
away from the boat.

The frequency is the number 
of complete waves passing 
any point per second.
▲ Figure 6.2 Water waves. The wavelength 
is the distance between two adjacent peaks 
or two adjacent troughs.

If wave (a) has a wavelength of  
2.0 m and a frequency of 1.5 * 108

▲ Figure 6.3 Electromagnetic waves. Like 
water waves, electromagnetic radiation can 
be characterized by a wavelength. Notice 
that the shorter the wavelength, l, the 
greater the frequency, n. The wavelength 
in (b) is half as l
