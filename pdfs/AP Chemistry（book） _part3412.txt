cerns about the 
proliferation of atomic weapons.
Uranium-235 ﬁssion was ﬁrst achieved during the late 1930s by 
Enrico Fermi and coworkers in Rome and shortly thereafter by Otto 
Hahn and coworkers in Berlin. Both groups were trying to produce 
transuranium elements. In 1938, Hahn identiﬁed barium among 
his reaction products. He was puzzled by this observation and ques-
tioned the identiﬁcation because the presence of barium was so unex-
pected. He sent a letter describing his experiments to Lise Meitner, a 
former coworker who had been forced to leave Germany because of 
the anti-Semitism of the Third Reich and had settled in Sweden. She 
surmised that Hahn’s experiment indicated a nuclear process was 
occurring in which the uranium-235 split. She called this process 
nuclear fission.
Meitner passed word of this discovery to her nephew, Otto Frisch, 
a physicist working at Niels Bohr’s institute in Copenhagen. Frisch 
repeated the experiment, verifying Hahn’s observations, and found
