13. An organism has the two chromosomes shown in the following figure.
A student claims that exposure to UV light prior to meiosis will increase the frequency of genetic
recombination during meiosis. Gamete-producing cells from this organism are placed into two groups. One
group is not exposed to UV light, and the other group is exposed to UV light prior to undergoing meiosis. The
gametes produced at the end of meiosis and the frequencies of those gametes are shown in the following table.
Gamete
Frequency of Gametes in Cells Not Exposed to UV Light
Frequency of Gametes in Cells Exposed to UV Light

(a) Identify and explain the stage of meiosis during which genetic recombination occurs.
(b) Identify the independent variable and the dependent variable in this experiment.
(c) Using the data,
