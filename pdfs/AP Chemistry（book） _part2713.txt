 the lungs, where it passes into 
the red blood cells and binds to Hb. When the blood reaches tissue in 
which the concentration of O2 is low, the equilibrium concentrations 
in Equation 17.11 shift to the left and O2 is released.
During periods of strenuous exertion, three factors work together 
to ensure delivery of O2 to active tissues. The role of each factor can 
be understood by applying Le Châtelier’s principle to Equation 17.11:
1. O2 is consumed, causing the equilibrium concentrations to 
shift to the left, releasing more O2.
2. Large amounts of CO2 are produced by metabolism, which in-
creases 3H+4 and causes the equilibrium concentrations to shift 
to the left, releasing O2.
3. Body temperature rises. Because Equation 17.11 is exothermic, 
the increase in temperature shifts the equilibrium concentra-
tions to the left, releasing O2.
In addition to the factors causing release of O2 to tissues, the decrease 
in pH stimulates an increase in breathing rate, which furnishes more
