t. Are ye 
 
 Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they 
 
 want to know,Are ye gangsters or cowboys? 
 
 A big boy sticks his face up to mine. I’m asking ye a question, he 
 
 says.Are ye gangsters or cowboys? 
 
 I tell him I don’t know and when he pokes his finger into my chest 
 
 Malachy says, I’m a gangster, Frank’s a cowboy.The big boy says,Your 
 
 little brother is smart and you’re a stupid Yank. 
 
 The boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he 
 
 pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me 
 
 the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and 
 
 punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head 
 
 on the ground but there’s a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and 
 
 I’m pulled away from him. 
 
 Mr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he’s whacking me 
 
 across the legs.You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior 
 
 you brought from Americ
