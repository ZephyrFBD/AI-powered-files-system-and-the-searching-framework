mperature? (c) Which 
factor is most sensitive to changes in temperature—the 
frequency of collisions, the orientation factor, or the frac-
tion of molecules with energy greater than the activation 
energy?
 14.52 (a) In which of the following reactions would you expect 
the orientation factor to be least important in leading 
to reaction: NO + O ¡ NO2 or H + Cl ¡ HCl?  
(b) Does the orientation factor depend on temperature?
 14.53 Calculate the fraction of atoms in a sample of argon gas at 
400 K that has an energy of 10.0 kJ or greater.
 14.54 (a) The activation energy for the isomerization of methyl 
isonitrile (Figure 14.6) is 160 kJ>mol. Calculate the frac-
tion of methyl isonitrile molecules that has an energy 
equal to or greater than the activation energy at 500 K. 
(b) Calculate this fraction for a temperature of 520 K. 
What is the ratio of the fraction at 520 K to that at 500 K?
 14.55 The gas-phase reaction Cl1g2 + HBr1g2 ¡ HCl1g2 + Br1g2 
has an overall energy change of -6
