diffuses across the synaptic
cleft.
2. Action potential is generated on sarcolemma and throughout the Ttubules. Receptors on the sarcolemma
initiate a depolarization event and action potential. The action potential travels along the sarcolemma throughout the
transverse system of tubules.
3. Sarcoplasmic reticulum releases Ca2+. As a result of the action
 
potential throughout the transverse system of tubules, the sarcoplasmic
 
reticulum releases Ca2+.
 
4. Myosin cross bridges form. The Ca2+ released by the sarcoplasmic
reticulum binds to troponin molecules on the actin helix, prompting tropomyosin molecules to expose binding sites
for myosin cross-bridge formation. If ATP is available, muscle contraction begins.
Humans and other vertebrates have three kinds of muscles:
 
1. Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and causes movements of the body.
2. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of blood vessels and the digestive tract, where it serves to advance the
movement of substances. Due to
