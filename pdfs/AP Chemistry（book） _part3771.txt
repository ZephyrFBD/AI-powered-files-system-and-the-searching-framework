many there are. (a) tetrahedral 3Cd(H2O)2Cl24, (b) square-pla-
nar 3IrCl2(PH3)24-, (c) octahedral 3Fe(o@phen)2Cl24+.
 23.44  Determine if each of the following complexes exhibits 
geometric isomerism. If geometric isomers exist, deter-
mine how many there are. (a) 3Rh(bipy)(o@phen)243+, 
(b) 3Co(NH3)3(bipy)Br42+, (c) square-planar 3Pd(en)(CN)24.
 23.45  Determine if each of the following metal complexes is 
chiral and therefore has an optical isomer: (a) tetrahedral 
[Zn(H2O)2Cl2], (b) octahedral trans-[Ru(bipy)2Cl2], (c) octa-
hedral cis-[Ru(bipy)2Cl2].
 23.46  Determine if each of the following metal complexes is chi-
ral and therefore has an optical isomer: (a) square planar 
[Pd(en)(CN)2], (b) octahedral [Ni(en)(NH3)4]2+, (c) octahe-
dral cis-[V(en)2ClBr].
