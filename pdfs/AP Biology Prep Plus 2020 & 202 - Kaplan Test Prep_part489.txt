ikely to influence hair color.
(D) is incorrect because gene flow can only alter the allelic frequencies
of a population as a whole but cannot change the genotypes of
existing members of a population, such as the parents described in the
question stem.
6. A
Learning Objective: 11.4
Crossing over shuﬀles alleles into new patterns, producing genetic
diversity (A). It does not create random point mutations, so (B) is
incorrect. (C) is incorrect because crossing over does not prevent
heterozygosity, which is a measure of allele diversity in a population.
(D) is incorrect because crossing-over ensures that nuclei are variable,
not that they have the same DNA.
7. C
Learning Objective: 11.4
Most diﬀering alleles are the result of single nucleotide changes, (C).
(A) is incorrect because only small changes are necessary to change
the function of a protein. (B) is incorrect because information is stored
on chromosomes as DNA sequences. (D) is incorrect because the exact
same DNA sequence could n
