on the negative charge is in the same direction as
the field.
(b) The field points toward the positive charge, and the
force on the negative charge is in the opposite direction
to the field.
(c) The field points away from the positive charge, and the
force on the negative charge is in the same direction as
the field.
(d) The field points away from the positive charge, and the
force on the negative charge is in the opposite 
direction to the field.
6. As an object acquires a positive charge, its mass usually
(a) decreases.
(b) increases.
(c) stays the same.
(d) becomes negative.
7. Refer to Fig. 16â€“32d. If the two charged plates were moved
until they are half the distance shown without changing the
charge on the plates, the electric field near the center of the
plates would
(a) remain almost exactly the same.
(b) increase by a factor of 2.
(c) increase, but not by a factor of 2.
(d) decrease by a factor of 2.
(e) decrease, but not by a factor of 2.
8. We wish to determine the electric f
