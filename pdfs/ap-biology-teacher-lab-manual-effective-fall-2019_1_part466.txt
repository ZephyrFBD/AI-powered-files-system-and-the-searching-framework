n the investigation, and have them explain how each affects genetic diversity. 
These mechanisms include crossing over, independent assortment, segregation, 
nondisjunction, and random fertilization. 
5. Do your students know what the basis is for genetic variability? The answer is in DNA 
sequence differences caused by mutations. These mutations can be caused either by 
damage to the DNA (usually from radiation or chemicals) or by a cell’s making a 
mistake as it copies its DNA. Most of the time, these “copy errors” are repaired.
