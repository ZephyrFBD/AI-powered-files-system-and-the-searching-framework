immune system more
effective. The immune system is also efficient
because each antibody need to have its own
gene.
b.
There are so many different antibody molecules
that can be made, each of which can non-
specifically target a particular pathogen to
destroy it. This non-specificity makes the
immune system more effective. The immune
system is also efficient because each antibody
does not need to have its own gene.
