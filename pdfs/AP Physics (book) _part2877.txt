*63. (II) (a) Suppose for a conventional X-ray image that the
X-ray beam consists of parallel rays. What would be the
magnification of the image? (b) Suppose, instead, that the
X-rays come from a point source (as in Fig. 25–41) that is
15 cm in front of a human body which is 25 cm thick, and
the film is pressed against the person’s back. Determine
and discuss the range of magnifications that result.

64. A pinhole camera uses a tiny pinhole instead of a 
lens. Show, using ray diagrams, how reasonably sharp
images can be formed using such a pinhole camera. In
particular, consider two point objects 2.0 cm apart that are
1.0 m from a 1.0-mm-diameter pinhole. Show that on a
piece of film 7.0 cm behind the pinhole the two objects
produce two separate circles that do not overlap.
