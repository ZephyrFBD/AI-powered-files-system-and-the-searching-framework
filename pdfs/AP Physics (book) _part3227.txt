ucleus is partly shielded at this point by the 12 inner electrons. Thus,
the outer electron of a sodium atom will be more strongly attracted by the 
of
the chlorine atom than by the 
of its own atom. This, combined with the
strong attraction between the two ions when the extra electron stays with the 
produces the charge distribution of Fig. 29–3, and hence the ionic bond.

FIGURE 29–4 In a neutral sodium
atom, the 10 inner electrons shield
the nucleus, so the single outer
electron is attracted by a net charge
of ±1e.

12 electrons in the inner shells and subshells.
Four of the five 3p electrons are shown in
doughnut-shaped clouds (seen in cross section
