c membrane. 
(2 points maximum; LO 3.45) 
Neurotransmitters bind to receptor molecules.
Neurotransmitters open ion channels. 
Neurotransmitters change membrane potential/ allow depolarization to occur/generate  
an action potential. 
(b) Based on the information provided above, explain how TTX most likely interferes with  
the transmission of information across synapses. (2 points maximum; LO 3.39, 2.28, 3.43) 
NOTE: Points are earned in a single row only. 
Evidence (1 point) 
Reasoning (1 point) 
No action potential in neurons 
Na+ cannot flow across neuronal membranes 
No reaction in postsynaptic cell 
No Ca++ released to trigger migration or fusion of vesicles 
containing neurotransmitters  
No neurotransmitter released
