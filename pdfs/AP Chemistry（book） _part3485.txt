hat the Curies may not have had at the time of their discovery?
(c) Suppose you had a 1-yr time period in order to measure the 
half-life of radium and related  
elements. You have some pure 
samples and a device that measures radioactivity quantita-
tively. Could you determine the half-life of the elements in the 
samples? Would you have different  
experimental constraints 
depending on whether the half-life were 10 yr or 1000 yr?
(d) Before its negative health effects were better understood, small 
amounts of radium salts were used in “glow in the dark” watches, 
such as the one shown here. The glow is not due to the radioac-
tivity of radium directly; rather, the radium is combined with 
a 
luminescent 
substance, 
such as zinc sulfide, which 
glows when it is exposed 
to radiation. Suppose you 
had pure samples of radium 
and zinc sulfide. How could 
you determine whether the 
glow of zinc sulfide is due to 
alpha, beta, or gamma radi-
ation? What type of device 
could you design
