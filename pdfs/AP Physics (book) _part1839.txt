CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17;1
Because the electric potential difference is defined as the potential energy
difference per unit charge, then the change in potential energy of a charge q
when it moves from point a to point b is
(17;3)
That is, if an object with charge q moves through a potential difference 
its
potential energy changes by an amount 
For example, if the potential dif-
ference between the two plates in Fig. 17–1 is 6 V, then a 
charge moved
from point b to point a will gain 
of electric potential energy.
(And it will lose 6 J of electric potential energy if it moves from a to b.) Similarly,
a
charge will gain
, and so on. Thus, electric potential
difference is a measure of how much energy an electric charge can acquire in a
given situation. And, since energy is the ability to do work, the electric potential
difference is also a measure of how much work a given
