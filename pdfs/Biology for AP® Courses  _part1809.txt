Clinical Trial Coordinator
A clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes
coordinating patient schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track
patients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and
accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. A
clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing degree, or other certification. People
who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator.
These jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctorâ€™s offices also conduct clinical trials
and may hire a coordinator.
