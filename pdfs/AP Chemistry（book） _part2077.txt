hable from one another. Real solutions best approx-
imate ideal behavior when the solute concentration is low and solute and solvent have 
similar molecular sizes and take part in similar types of intermolecular attractions.
Many solutions do not obey Raoult’s law exactly and so are not ideal. If, for instance, 
the solvent–solute interactions in a solution are weaker than either the solvent–solvent 
or solute–solute interactions, the vapor pressure tends to be greater than that predicted 
by Raoult’s law. When the solute–solvent interactions in a solution are exceptionally 
strong, as might be the case when hydrogen bonding exists, the vapor pressure is lower 
than that predicted by Raoult’s law. Although you should be aware that these departures 
from ideality occur, we will ignore them for the remainder of this chapter.
Boiling-Point Elevation
In Sections 11.5 and 11.6, we examined the vapor pressures of pure substances and how 
to use them to construct phase diagrams. How does the
