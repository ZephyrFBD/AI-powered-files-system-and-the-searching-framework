error bars did not overlap. Thus, the difference in the two Visit
2 bars is statistically significant, and the results for that visit
demonstrate that exercise helps memory (meaning that there is

related to memory).
The null hypothesis is that “Exercising before taking a memory

test.” I would fail to reject the null hypothesis for Visit 1
because the differences between the two groups are not
statistically significant. In other words, there is no difference on
the memory task whether the subject exercised before the task
or not. (It is incorrect to
