Strategies
5.A: Perform 
mathematical 
calculations, including
a. Mathematical 
equations in the 
curriculum.
b. Means.
c. Rates.
d. Ratios.
e. Percentages. 
Calculate one or more of 
the components of Hardy-
Weinberg equation.
Calculate the mean of a 
data set.
Calculate the rate of a 
reaction.
Calculate a ratio.
Calculate a percent change.
Have students complete 
a teacher-selected 
Hardy-Weinberg lab. 
Students can use their 
data to predict changes 
in gene frequencies in the 
population they studied.
Error Analysis
5.B: Use confidence 
intervals and/or error 
bars (both determined 
using standard errors) 
to determine whether 
sample means are 
statistically different.
Draw standard error bars,  
± 1 SEM or ±2 SEM.
Draw error bars for the 95% 
confidence interval.
Determine if there is overlap 
between the bars of two or 
more sample means. 
After completing an 
investigation such as the 
Diffusion and Osmosis 
lab, collect class data.
