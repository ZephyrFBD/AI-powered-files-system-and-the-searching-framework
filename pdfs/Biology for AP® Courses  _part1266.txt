irs on the spindle. Metaphase
II has a single line of chromosomes on the
spindle. Pair of chromosomes are pulled apart
and migrate towards the poles in anaphase I,
while in anaphase II sister chromatids separate.
Telophase I reconstitutes the nucleus and loosens
the chromosomes, while telophase II mimics
telophase I.
d.
Prophase I condenses the chromosomes and
eliminates the nuclear membrane. The
microtubules arrange in a spindle. Prophase II
mimics prophase I. Metaphase I occurs when
chromosomes appear in homologous pairs on the
spindle. During Metaphase II, the chromosomes
line up in a double line across the spindle. Each
pair of chromosomes is pulled apart and migrate
towards the poles in anaphase I, while in
anaphase II sister chromatids separate.
Telophase I reconstitutes the nucleus and loosen
the chromosomes, while telophase II mimics
telophase I.
17. Though the stages of meiosis have the same names as
the stages of mitosis, they exhibit fundamental differences.
