eacts with silica. The inter-
halogens are compounds formed between two different halogen ele-
ments. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine form a series of oxyacids, in 
which the halogen atom is in a positive oxidation state. These com-
pounds and their associated oxyanions are strong oxidizing agents.
OXYGEN AND THE OTHER GROUP 6A ELEMENTS (SECTIONS 22.5 
 
AND 22.6) Oxygen has two allotropes, O2 and O3 (ozone). Ozone is 
unstable compared to O2, and it is a stronger oxidizing agent than O2. 
Most reactions of O2 lead to oxides, compounds in which oxygen is 
in the -2 oxidation state. The soluble oxides of nonmetals generally 
produce acidic aqueous solutions; they are called acidic anhydrides 
or acidic oxides. In contrast, soluble metal oxides produce basic solu-
tions and are called basic anhydrides or basic oxides. Many metal ox-
ides that are insoluble in water dissolve in acid, accompanied by the 
formation of H2O.
Peroxides contain OÂ¬O bonds and oxygen in the -1 oxida-
tion state. Pe
