(Section 21.1)
radionuclide A radioactive nuclide. (Section 21.1)
radiotracer A radioisotope that can be used to trace the path of 
an element in a chemical system. (Section 21.5)
Raoult’s law A law stating that the partial pressure exerted by 
solvent vapor above the solution, P
solution, equals the product of 
the mole fraction of the solvent, Xsolvent, and the vapor pressure 
of the pure solvent, P°
solvent. P
solution = XsolventP°
solvent. (Section 13.5)
rare earth element See lanthanide (rare earth) element. 
(Sections 6.8 and 6.9)
rate constant A constant of proportionality between the 
reaction rate and the concentrations of reactants that appear in 
the rate law. (Section 14.3)
rate-determining step The slowest elementary step in a reaction 
mechanism. (Section 14.6)
rate law An equation that relates the reaction rate to the 
concentrations of reactants (and sometimes of products also).
