 object always exerts a
force on the first object which is equal in magnitude but oppo-
site in direction:

where 
is the force on object B exerted by object A.
The tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion
is called inertia. Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object.

Weight refers to the gravitational force on an object, and is
equal to the product of the object’s mass m and the acceleration
of gravity 
(4;3)
Force, which is a vector, can be considered as a push or pull;
or, from Newton’s second law, force can be defined as an action
capable of giving rise to acceleration. The net force on an object
is the vector sum of all forces acting on that object.
When two objects slide over one another, the force of 
friction that each object exerts on the other can be written
approximately as
where 
is the normal force
(the force each object exerts on the other perpendicular to their
contact surfaces), and 
is the coefficient of kineti
