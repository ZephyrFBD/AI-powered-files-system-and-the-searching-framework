Ribose has a left/right symmetry, and the right-
handed form occurs in Earth organisms.
Continuing with the analogy, if neither the chicken nor the
egg came first, then both must have arisen together. Some

regard simultaneous innovations in both catalysis and
information storage and retrieval as too improbable. In
samples of meteorites, both amino acids and nucleic acids
have been found. The amino acids are mixtures of left- and
right-handed symmetries, although some have shown a
significant bias toward the left-handed form (J. Elisa et al.,
ACS Central Science, 2016). The arrival from space of the
seeds of biomolecules is called panspermia. Carl Sagan
(1966) and Francis Crick (1973), one of the first to
describe the structure of DNA, regarded panspermia as the
only plausible origin of life on Earth. In fact, their belief
was in directed panspermia, the intentional seeding by
