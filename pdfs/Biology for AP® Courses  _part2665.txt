d takes up water or the soil hydrates. Ψm cannot be manipulated by the plant and
is typically ignored in well-watered roots, stems, and leaves.
Movement of Water and Minerals in the Xylem
Solutes, pressure, gravity, and matric potential are all important for the transport of water in plants. Water moves from an
area of higher total water potential (higher Gibbs free energy) to an area of lower total water potential. Gibbs free energy is
the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work. This is expressed as ΔΨ.
Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface. It is the main driver of water
movement in the xylem. Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leaf–atmosphere interface; it creates
negative pressure (tension) equivalent to –2 MPa at the leaf surface. This value varies greatly depending on the vapor
pressure deficit, which can be negligible at high relative humidity (RH) and substantial at low R
