aven now with 
 
 his brother and his sister and isn’t that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver 
 
 is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next 
 
  
  
 to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. 
 
 She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, 
 
 that we can’t be in graveyards in the dark. 
 
 Grandma whispers to Aunt Aggie,Who’ll put the child in the cof- 
 
 fin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won’t.That’s the job for the mother. 
 
 Uncle Pat hears them. I’ll put the child in the coffin, he says. He 
 
 limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam’s shoulders. She looks 
 
 up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I’ll put the child in the cof- 
 
 fin,Angela. 
 
 Oh, Pat, she says. Pat. 
 
 I can do it, he says. Sure he’s only a small child an’ I never lifted a 
 
 small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I 
 
 won’t drop him,Angela. I won’t. Honest to God, I won’t.
