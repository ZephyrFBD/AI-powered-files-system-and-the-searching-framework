infinity symbol 1∞2 indicates that the 
alcohol is completely miscible with the solvent.

In glucose, the OH groups enhance 
the aqueous solubility because of 
their ability to hydrogen‐bond 
with H2O.
Cyclohexane, C6H12, which 
has no polar OH groups, is 
essentially insoluble in water.

▲ Figure 13.10 The correlation of molecular 
structure with solubility.
Vitamins have unique chemical structures that affect their solubil-
ities in different parts of the human body. Vitamin C and the B vi-
tamins are soluble in water, for example, whereas vitamins A, D, E, 
and K are soluble in nonpolar solvents and in fatty tissue (which is 
nonpolar). Because of their water solubility, vitamins B and C are 
not stored to any appreciable extent in the
