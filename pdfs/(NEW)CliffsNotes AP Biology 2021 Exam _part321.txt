eotides earlier in its synthesis.
The growing Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand, however, still has its RNA primer attached, because a primer
must initiate each new fragment. The details of DNA replication are summarized here. Numbers correspond to
events illustrated in Figure 9-2:
1. Helicase unwinds the DNA, producing a replication fork (1A, 1B). Single-strand binding proteins prevent the
single strands of DNA from recombining (1C). Topoisomerase removes twists and knots that form in the double-
stranded template as a result of the unwinding induced by helicase (1D).
2. Primase (2A) initiates DNA replication at special nucleotide sequences (called origins of replication) with short
segments of RNA nucleotides, called RNA primers (2B).
3. DNA polymerase attaches to the RNA primers and begins elongation, the adding of DNA nucleotides to the
complementary strand. 4. The leading complementary strand is assembled continuously toward the replication
fork as the double-helix DNA uncoil
