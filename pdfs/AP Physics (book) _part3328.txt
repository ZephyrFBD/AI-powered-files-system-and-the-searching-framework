rms of radioactivity, and how radioactive
decay can be used in a variety of fields to
determine the age of old objects, from bones and
trees to rocks and other mineral substances, and
obtain information on the history of the Earth.
Shown is one version of a Chart of the Nuclides.
Each horizontal row has a square for each known
isotope (nuclide) of one element with a particular
Z value (
number of electrons in the neutral
atom
number of protons in the nucleus). At the
far left is a white box with the average atomic
weight (or a range if uncertain) of the naturally
occurring isotopes of that element. Each vertical
column contains nuclides with the same neutron
number N. For 
(to right of pencil), starting at
the bottom, there is a lone neutron, then above 
it 
, then 
and 
. Each square is color coded:
black means a stable nuclide. Radioactive nuclides
are blue green for 
decay, pink for 
decay or
electron capture ( ) such as 
, yellow for 
decay, and so on. Thus 
and 
are stable but
