They’re old. Who gives a damn?
I have exposed in the books for decades the Cult plan to cull the
world’s old people and even to introduce at some point what they
call a ‘demise pill’ which at a certain age everyone would take and
be out of here by law. In March, 2021, Spain legalised euthanasia and
assisted suicide following the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg
and Canada on the Tiptoe to the demise pill. Treatment of old people
by many ‘care’ homes has been a disgrace in the ‘Covid’ era. There
are many, many, caring staﬀ – I know some. There have, however,
been legions of stories about callous treatment of old people and
their families. Police were called when families came to take their
loved ones home in the light of isolation that was killing them. They
became prisoners of the state. Care home residents in insane, fascist
Ontario, Canada, were not allowed to leave their room once the
‘Covid’ hoax began. UK staﬀ have even wheeled elderly people
away from windows
