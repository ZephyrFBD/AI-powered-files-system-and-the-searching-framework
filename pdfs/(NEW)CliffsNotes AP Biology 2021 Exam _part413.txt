lymorphism). For example, some predators form a
“search image,” or standard representation of their prey. By standardizing on the most common form of its prey, the
predator optimizes its search effort. The prey that is rare, however, escapes predation.
Not all variation has selective value. Instead, much of the variation observed, especially at the molecular level in
DNA and proteins, is neutral variation. For example, the differences in fingerprint patterns among humans
represent neutral variation. In many cases, however, the environment to which the variation is exposed determines
whether a variation is neutral or whether it has selective value.
Humans impact the evolutionary potential of many species by reducing the size of their populations and decreasing
genetic variation. When genetic variation decreases, populations lack the variation necessary to respond to selection
pressures imposed by changing environments.
Monocultures in agriculture reduce genetic variation because only a
