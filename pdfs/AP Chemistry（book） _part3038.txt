us molecules leads to a 
decrease in the entropy of the system.
Predict whether ∆S is positive or negative for each process, assuming each occurs at constant temperature:
(a) H2O1l2 ¡ H2O1g2
(b) Ag+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 ¡ AgCl1s2
(c) 4 Fe1s2 + 3 O21g2 ¡ 2 Fe2O31s2
(d) N21g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 NO1g2
Sample Exercise 19.3 
Predicting the Sign of ∆S
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given four reactions and asked to predict the sign 
of ∆S for each.
Plan We expect ∆S to be positive if there is an increase in tempera-
ture, increase in volume, or increase in number of gas particles. 
The question states that the temperature is constant, and so we 
need to concern ourselves only with volume and number of 
particles.
Solve
(a) Evaporation involves a large increase in volume as liquid 
changes to gas. One mole of water (18 g) occupies about 18 mL 
as a liquid, and if it could exist as a gas at STP it would occupy 
22.4 L. Because the molecules are distributed throughout a 
much larger volume in the gaseous state, an
