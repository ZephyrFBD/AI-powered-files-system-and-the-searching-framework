 mg/kg of cocaine 
(that is, 3.0 mg cocaine per kg of animal mass), the concen-
tration of dopamine in their brains increases by 0.75 mM af-
ter 60 seconds. Calculate how many molecules of dopamine 
would be produced in a rat (average brain volume 5.00 mm3) 
after 60 seconds of a 3.0 mg/kg dose of cocaine. 
 4.101 Hard water contains Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, which interfere 
with the action of soap and leave an insoluble coating on 
the insides of containers and pipes when heated. Water soft-
eners replace these ions with Na+. Keep in mind that charge 
balance must be maintained. (a) If 1500 L of hard water con-
tains 0.020 M Ca2+ and 0.0040 M Mg2+, how many moles of 
Na+ are needed to replace these ions? (b) If the sodium is 
added to the water softener in the form of NaCl, how many 
grams of sodium chloride are needed?
 4.102 Tartaric acid, H2C4H4O6, has two acidic hydrogens. The acid 
is often present in wines and a salt derived from the acid pre-
cipitates from solution as the wine ag
