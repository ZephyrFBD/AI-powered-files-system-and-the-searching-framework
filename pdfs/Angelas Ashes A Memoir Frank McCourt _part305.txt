up to me with her white 
 
 teeth and her dancer’s dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures 
 
 that are supposed to come from olden times and she says,Give me 
 
 your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I’m dizzy 
 
 and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to 
 
 cry but I’m saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes 
 
 hoosh hoosh. 
 
 Mrs. O’Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, 
 
 you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous.Next week, 
 
 boys and girls, and don’t forget the sixpence for the little black boy. 
 
 Boys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs 
 
 and out the door hoping my pals won’t see me with boys who wear kilts 
 
 and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.
