could then be sepa-
rated by filtration (Figure 1.12). We would have to use other chemical reactions, which we 
will learn about later, to transform the dissolved iron back into metal.
An important method of separating the components of a homogeneous mixture 
is distillation, a process that depends on the different abilities of substances to form 
gases. For example, if we boil a solution of salt and water, the water evaporates, forming a 
gas, and the salt is left behind. The gaseous water can be converted back to a liquid on the 
walls of a condenser, as shown in Figure 1.13.
Give It Some Thought
Which of these changes are physical and which are chemical? Explain.
(a) Plants make sugar from carbon dioxide and water.
(b) Water vapor in the air forms frost.
(c) A goldsmith melts a nugget of gold and pulls it into a wire.
