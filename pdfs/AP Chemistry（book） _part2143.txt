CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
 13.47  A sulfuric acid solution containing 571.6 g of H2SO4 per 
liter of solution has a density of 1.329 g>cm3. Calculate 
 
(a) the mass percentage, (b) the mole fraction, (c) the mo-
lality, (d) the molarity of H2SO4 in this solution.
 13.48  Ascorbic acid 1vitamin C, C6H8O62 is a water-soluble vita-
min. A solution containing 80.5 g of ascorbic acid dissolved 
in 210 g of water has a density of 1.22 g>mL at 55 Â°C. Calcu-
late (a) the mass percentage, (b) the mole fraction, (c) the 
molality, (d) the molarity of ascorbic acid in this solution.
 13.49  The density of acetonitrile 1CH3CN2 is 0.786 g>mL and 
the density of methanol 1CH3OH2 is 0.791 g>mL. A solu-
tion is made by dissolving 22.5 mL of CH3OH in 98.7 mL of 
CH3CN. (a) What is the mole fraction of methanol in the 
solution? (b) What is the molality of the solution? (c) As-
suming that the volumes
