 Paul Society to see if there’s any 
 
 chance of getting furniture.The man says he’ll give us a docket for a 
 
 table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we’ll have to go to a secondhand 
 
 furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture 
 
 home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins 
 
  
  
 and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and 
 
 asks the man if the beds we’re getting are secondhand. He says of course 
 
 they are, and she says she’s very worried about sleeping in beds some-

 one might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The 
 
 man says, I’m very sorry, but beggars can’t be choosers. 
 
 It takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end 
 
 of Limerick to the other.There are four wheels on the pram but one is 
 
 bockety, it wants to go in a different direction.We have two beds, one 
 
 sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs.We’re happy with the 
 
 house.
