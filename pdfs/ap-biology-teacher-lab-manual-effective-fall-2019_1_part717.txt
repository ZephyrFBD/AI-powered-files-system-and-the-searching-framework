e using the same procedure described above. 
■ Designing and Conducting Your Investigation 
The procedure should have raised several questions about factors that relate to the rate 
of transpiration in plants. Some possible questions are listed below, but you may have 
others. 
•  What environmental variables might affect the rate of transpiration? 
•  Do all parts of a plant transpire? 
•  Do all plants transpire at the same rate? 
•  Is there a relationship between the habitat in which plants evolved to their rate of 
transpiration? 
Rate of transpiration can be measured by a variety of methods, including the use of a 
potometer with or without a gas pressure sensor and computer interface or the use of the 
whole plant method. These methods are detailed in this investigation, but your teacher 
may help you substitute another procedure. 
If using a gas pressure sensor and computer interface to measure transpiration rate, 
your teacher likely will provide instructions. If you are unfam
