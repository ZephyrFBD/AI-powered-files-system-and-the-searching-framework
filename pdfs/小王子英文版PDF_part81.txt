trictors from the inside."
"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."
So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was
torn.
"You have plans that I do not know about,"I said.
But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:
"You know­­ my descent to the earth... Tomorrowwill be its anniversary."
Then, after a silence, he went on:
"I came down very near here."
And he flushed.
And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One
question, however, occurred to me:
"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you­­ a week ago­­
you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region?
You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
The little prince flushed again.
And I added, with some hesitancy:
"Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?"
The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions­­ but when one
flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
