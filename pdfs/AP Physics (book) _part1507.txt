o be precise, the particular
temperature range from 14.5°C to 15.5°C is specified because the heat required 
is very slightly different at different temperatures. The difference is less than 1%
over the range 0 to 100°C, and we will ignore it for most purposes.] More often
used than the calorie is the kilocalorie (kcal), which is 1000 calories. Thus 1 kcal
is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 C°. Often a kilo-
calorie is called a Calorie (with a capital C), and this Calorie (or the kJ) is used to
specify the energy value of food. In the British system of units, heat is measured
in British thermal units (Btu). One Btu is defined as the heat needed to raise 
the temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 F°. It can be shown (Problem 5) that
Also, one therm is 105 Btu.
The idea that heat is related to energy transfer was pursued by a number of
scientists in the 1800s, particularly by an English brewer, James Prescott Joule
(1818–1889). Joule and others performed a numb
