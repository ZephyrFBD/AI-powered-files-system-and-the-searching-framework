omes. Second, the nuclear envelope breaks down. Third, the mitotic spindle is assembled.
The development of the mitotic spindle begins as the MTOCs move apart to opposite ends (or poles) of the nucleus.
As they move apart, microtubules develop from each MTOC, increasing in length by the addition of tubulin units to
the microtubule ends away from the MTOC. Microtubules from each MTOC connect to a specialized region in the
centromere called a kinetochore. Microtubules tug on the kinetochore, moving the chromosomes back and forth,
toward one pole, then the other. In addition to these microtubules, the completed spindle also includes other
microtubules from each MTOC that overlap at the center of the spindle and do not attach to the chromosomes.
2. Metaphase (alignment) begins when the chromosomes are aligned across the metaphase plate, a plane lying
between the two poles of the spindle. Metaphase ends when the microtubules, still attached to the kinetochores, pull
each chromosome apart in
