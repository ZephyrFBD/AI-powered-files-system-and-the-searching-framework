Figure 9.8 Translation
 The process of translation consists of three stages: initiation,
elongation, and termination.
Initiation begins when mRNA becomes attached to a subunit of the
ribosome. This first codon is always AUG. It must be positioned
correctly in order for transcription of an amino acid sequence to
begin.
Elongation continues as tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome
and a polypeptide chain is formed. One mRNA molecule is
generally translated simultaneously by several ribosomes in clusters
called polyribosomes.
Termination of an mRNA strand is complete when a ribosome
reaches one of three termination or stop codons. A release factor
breaks the bond between the tRNA and the last amino acid of the
polypeptide chain. The polypeptide is freed from the ribosome, and
mRNA is broken down.
The Genetic Code
The complete genetic code is shown in Figure 9.9. There are 64 (43)
possible combinations of the four nitrogenous bases. Notice that AUG,
which codes for methionine, a
