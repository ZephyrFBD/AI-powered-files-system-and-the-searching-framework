n a 
particular system.
It is important to realize that the effects of all these attractions are additive. For 
example, acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1-propanol, CH3CH2CH2OH, have the same 
molecular weight, 60 amu, and both are capable of forming hydrogen bonds. However, a 
pair of acetic acid molecules can form two hydrogen bonds, whereas a pair of 1-propanol 
molecules can form only one (Figure 11.15). Hence, the boiling point of acetic acid is 
higher. These effects can be important, especially for very large polar molecules such as 
proteins, which have multiple dipoles and hydrogen-bonding groups over their surfaces. 
These molecules can be held together in solution to a surprisingly high degree due to the 
presence of multiple attractive interactions.
When comparing the relative strengths of intermolecular attractions, consider these 
generalizations:
1. When the molecules of two substances have comparable molecular 
weights and shapes, dispersion forces are approximately equal in
