elimination.
25.2 Nutrition and Energy Production
Animal diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the body. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary
components of food. Some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body.
These include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary amounts is
stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in fat cells. Excess adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious
health problems. ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is obtained from the metabolic pathways. Excess
carbohydrates and energy are stored as glycogen in the body.
25.3 Digestive System Processes
Digestion begins with ingestion, where the food is taken in the mouth. Digestion and absorption take place in a series of
steps with special enzymes playing important roles in digesting carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Elimination
