circle of radius r, at an angle 
as shown in Fig. 10–36a. Only the vertical compo-
nent,
acts to balance the weight mg. We set the length in Eq. 10–10
equal to the circumference of the circle,
Then the net upward force
due to surface tension is
We set this surface tension
force equal to one-sixth the weight of the insect since it has six legs:
So
If 
had come out greater than 1, the surface tension would not
have been great enough to support the insect’s weight.
NOTE Our estimate ignored the buoyant force and ignored any difference
between the radius of the insect’s “foot” and the radius of the surface depression.

ESTIMATE
Soaps and detergents lower the surface tension of water. This is desirable for
washing and cleaning since the high surface tension of pure water prevents
