 appeared in his table. When these elements were discovered, their 
properties closely matched those predicted by Mendeleev, as shown in Table 7.1.
In 1913, two years after Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of the atom 
 (Section 2.2), English physicist Henry Moseley (1887–1915) developed the concept 
of atomic numbers. Bombarding different elements with high-energy electrons, Moseley 
found that each element produced X rays of a unique frequency and that the frequency 
generally increased as the atomic mass increased. He arranged the X-ray frequencies in 
order by assigning a unique whole number, called an atomic number, to each element. 
Moseley correctly identified the atomic number as the number of protons in the nucleus 
of the atom. 
 (Section 2.3)
The concept of atomic number clarified some problems in the periodic table of 
Moseley’s day, which was based on atomic weights. For example, the atomic weight of 
Ar (atomic number 18) is greater than that of K (atomic number 19),
