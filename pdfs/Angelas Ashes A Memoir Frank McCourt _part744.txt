 God’s mercy is infinite but how 
 
 can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers 
 
 telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a 
 
 girl dying of the galloping consumption. 
 
 I cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. 
 
 I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to 
 
 Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him 
 
 to help me but I think he’s too disgusted with me. I kneel with people 
 
 in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can’t 
 
 breathe,my heart pounds,my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run 
 
 from the church. 
 
 I swear I’ll go to confession at Christmas. I can’t. Easter. I can’t. 
 
 Weeks and months pass and it’s a year since Theresa died. I’ll go on her 
 
 anniversary but I can’t. I’m fifteen now and I pass churches without 
 
 stopping. I’ll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests 
 
 like Bing C
