ilibrium-constant expression. Remember, however, that solids do not appear in 
the equilibrium-constant expressions for heterogeneous equilibrium. 
 (Section 15.4)
Thus, the solubility-product expression for BaSO4, which is based on Equation 17.15, is
 
Ksp = 3Ba2 +43SO4
2 -4 
[17.16]
The coefficient for each ion in the equilibrium equation also equals its subscript in the 
compound’s chemical formula.
In general, the solubility product Ksp of a compound equals the product of the  
concentration of the ions involved in the equilibrium, each raised to the power  
of its coefficient in the equilibrium equation.
The values of Ksp at 25 °C for many ionic solids are tabulated in Appendix D. The 
value of Ksp for BaSO4 is 1.1 * 10-10, a very small number indicating that only a very 
small amount of the solid dissolves in 25 °C water.
Write the expression for the solubility-product constant for CaF2, and look up the corresponding Ksp value in Appendix D.
