SOLUTION
Sample Exercise 20.9 
Determining Spontaneity
We look up standard reduction potentials for both half- 
reactions and use them to calculate E° using Equation 20.10:
Because E° is negative, the reaction is not spontaneous in the 
direction written. Copper metal does not react with acids 
as written in Equation (a). The reverse reaction, however, is 
spontaneous and has a positive E° value:
Thus, Cu2+ can be reduced by H2.
(b) We follow a procedure analogous to that in (a):
In this case:
E° = 11.36 V2 - 10.54 V2 = +0.82 V
Because the value of E ° is positive, this reaction is sponta-
neous and could be used to build a voltaic cell.
