material (dead animals, plants, and humus) that undergo respiration.
In aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is
based on one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH4). This methane
moves into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that
oxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.

Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. It is a macronutrient, and in
nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad
processes, many of which are ca
