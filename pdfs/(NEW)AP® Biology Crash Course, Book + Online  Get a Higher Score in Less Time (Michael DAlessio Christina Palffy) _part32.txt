the cytoplasm
Controls cell shape; causes
movement of chromosomes and
organelles within the cell
Vesicle(s)
Small, spherical, numerous; surrounded by one membrane
Move substances from the ER to the
Golgi apparatus and from there to
the plasma membrane
Nucleus
Large, round; surrounded by nuclear envelope consisting of
two membranes studded with pores
Site of chromosome (DNA) storage
and RNA synthesis (transcription)
Cell Wall
Rigid; contains cellulose
Provides support and protection of
cells

Membranes and Transport
I.
Cell Membrane Structure
A. Plasma Membrane—separates internal environment from external environment and allows substances to
be transported in and out of the cell.
B. Selective Permeability—the plasma membrane is selectively permeable, meaning that it allows some
substances to pass through it, but not others. It is a direct consequence of the membrane structure, called
the Fluid Mosaic Model. Essentially, the membrane is a mosaic of proteins that are embedded
