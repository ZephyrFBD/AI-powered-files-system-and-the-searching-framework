 viewed on a screen located 2.5 m from
the grating. The incident light beam consists of two 
wavelengths,
and 
Calculate the linear distance between the first-order bright
fringes of these two wavelengths on the screen.
90. How many slits per centimeter must a grating have if 
there is to be no second-order spectrum for any visible
wavelength?
91. When yellow sodium light,
falls on a diffraction
grating, its first-order peak on a screen 72.0 cm away falls
3.32 cm from the central peak. Another source produces
a line 3.71 cm from the central peak. What is its wavelength?
How many 
are on the grating?
92. Two of the lines of the atomic hydrogen spectrum have
wavelengths of 656 nm and 410 nm. If these fall at normal
incidence on a grating with 
what will be the
angular separation of the two wavelengths in the first-order
spectrum?
93. A tungstenâ€“halogen bulb emits a continuous spectrum of
ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light in the wavelength
range 360 nm to 2000 nm. Assume that the l
