of the target (Fig. 28–13) emits radiation because of its deceleration
(Chapter 22), and in this case it is called bremsstrahlung (German for “braking
radiation”). Because energy is conserved, the energy of the emitted photon, hf,
equals the loss of kinetic energy of the electron,
so
An electron may lose all or a part of its energy in such a collision. The continuous
X-ray spectrum (Fig. 28–11) is explained as being due to such bremsstrahlung
collisions in which varying amounts of energy are lost by the electrons. The
shortest-wavelength X-ray (the highest frequency) must be due to an electron
that gives up all its kinetic energy to produce one photon in a single collision.
Since the initial kinetic energy of an electron is equal to the energy given it by the
accelerating voltage, V, then
In a single collision in which the electron
is brought to rest
