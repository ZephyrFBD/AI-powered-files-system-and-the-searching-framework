 3.67 Automotive air bags inflate when sodium azide, NaN3, 
 
rapidly decomposes to its component elements:
 
 
2 NaN31s2 ¡ 2 Na1s2 + 3 N21g2
(a) How many moles of N2 are produced by the decomposi-
tion of 1.50 mol of NaN3?
(b) How many grams of NaN3 are required to form 10.0 g of 
nitrogen gas?
(c) How many grams of NaN3 are required to produce 
10.0 ft3 of nitrogen gas, about the size of an automotive 
air bag, if the gas has a density of 1.25 g/L?
 3.68 The complete combustion of octane, C8H18, a  
component of 
gasoline, proceeds as follows:
 
 
2 C8H181l2 + 25 O21g2 ¡ 16 CO21g2 + 18 H2O1g2
(a) How many moles of O2 are needed to burn 1.50 mol of 
C8H18?
(b) How many grams of O2 are needed to burn 10.0 g of C8H18?
(c) Octane has a density of 0.692 g>mL at 20 °C. How many 
grams of O2 are required to burn 15.0 gal of C8H18 (the 
capacity of an average fuel tank)?
(d) How many grams of CO2 are produced when 15.0 gal of 
C8H18 are combusted?
