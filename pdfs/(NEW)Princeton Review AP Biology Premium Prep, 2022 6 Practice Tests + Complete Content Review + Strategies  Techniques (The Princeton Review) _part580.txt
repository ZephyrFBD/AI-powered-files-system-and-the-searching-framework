B
When water flows out of the tubule, it is moving by simple osmosis. However, because it is a polar
molecule, it must pass through an aquaporin channel, which is facilitated diffusion.

D
ADH makes the collecting duct permeable to water. If it is inhibited, then it will be unable to do that,
meaning (D) is correct. The question doesnâ€™t say that the inhibitor is inhibiting the aquaporins directly.
Instead, the inhibitor says it is inhibiting the ADH.

C
To make concentrated urine, the medulla must be very osmotic because it must reclaim a lot of water
from the collecting duct. To make a very osmotic medulla, the Loop of Henle must be very long. The
collecting duct should be very permeable, not impermeable, because concentrated urine means that a lot
of water has been reclaimed.

The carrying capacity is the maximum number of organisms of a given species that can be maintained in a
given environment. Once a population reaches its carrying capacity, the n
