becomes strong and healthy, she will pass her acquired strength and
health to her children, and so on. Lamarck’s ideas concerning the
inheritance of acquired characteristics have generally been discredited,
though some of them are being reconsidered in light of research into
epigenetics, the study of heritable factors other than genes (such as
molecular modifications to DNA that influence gene expression).
4.2 Recall Darwin’s theory
4.3 Explain how natural selection impacts evolution
Darwin presented his postulates for his theory of evolution by natural
selection in his work The Origin of Species (1859). There have been slight
modifications to the theory based on more up-to-date knowledge about
genetics and molecular biology but, for the most part, Darwin’s theories
are accepted today. Virtually all scientists consider evolution by means of
natural selection to be an established fact.
Darwin had several original postulates for his theory
