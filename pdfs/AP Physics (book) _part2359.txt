ny loops of thin wire
that serve as a sensing coil. Under normal conditions (no ground fault), the current
moving in the hot power wire is exactly balanced by the returning current in the
neutral wire. If something goes wrong and the hot wire touches the ungrounded
metal case of the device or appliance, some of the entering current can pass through
a person who touches the case and then to ground (a ground fault).Then the return
current in the neutral wire will be less than the entering current in the hot wire, so
there is a net current passing through the GFCIâ€™s iron ring. Because the current 
is ac, it is changing and that current difference produces a changing magnetic field
in the iron, thus inducing an emf in the sensing coil wrapped around the iron. For
example, if a device draws 8.0 A, and there is a ground fault through a person of
then 7.9 A will appear in the neutral wire. The emf induced 
in the sensing coil by this 100-mA difference is amplified by a simple transistor
