eproduction—a form of reproduction not requiring meiosis or fertilization; only passes a copy
of genes to its progeny. It’s a type of reproduction in which there is no variation in genetic makeup.
Bacteria reproduce via asexual reproduction.
B. Clone—an individual that arises from asexual reproduction.
C. Sexual Reproduction—a type of reproduction that involves variation because two parents give rise to their
progeny.
Major evolutionary advantage because of genetic variation.

Meiosis
A. Meiosis, like mitosis, is preceded by replication of chromosomes.
B. Meiosis I is the first round of cell division, where homologous pairs of chromosomes are separated from
one another into two cells that are haploid. Meiosis I has four stages:
1. Prophase I—Tetrads are formed or the pairing of homologous chromosomes via synapsis; chiasmata
or the site of crossing over/exchange of genetic material is formed during this phase.
2. Metaphase I—homologous chromosomes pair with each other at the metaphas
