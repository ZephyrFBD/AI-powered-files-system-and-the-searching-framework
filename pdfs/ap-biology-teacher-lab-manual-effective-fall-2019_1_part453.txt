periments should you perform to verify your findings? 
•  Does an increased number of cells in mitosis mean that these cells are dividing faster 
than the cells in the roots with a lower number of cells in mitosis?  
•  What other way could you determine how fast the rate of mitosis is occurring in root 
tips? 
■ DESIGNING AND CONDUCTING INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS 
Students can design and conduct an investigation to determine what substances in the 
environment might increase or decrease the rate of mitosis. Consider, for example, 
abiotic soil factors such as salinity, temperature, and pH, or biotic factors, including 
roundworms, which might alter root growth. 
■ Part 3: Loss of Cell Cycle Control in Cancer 
Materials 
•  Karyotype pictures of normal and HeLa cells  
(Students can search for these on the Internet.)  
■ Prelab Questions 
•  Many of us have family members who have or have had cancer. Cancer occurs when 
cells divide abnormally. There are many questions students should
