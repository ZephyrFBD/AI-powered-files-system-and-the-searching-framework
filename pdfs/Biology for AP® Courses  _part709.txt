macromolecules—most often proteins—that speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy barriers. Enzymes
are very specific for the reactions they catalyze; because they are polypeptides, enzymes can have a variety of shapes
attributed to interactions among amino acid R-groups. One part of the enzyme, the active site, interacts with the substrate
via the induced fit model of interaction. Substrate binding alters the shape of the enzyme to facilitate the chemical reaction
in several different ways, including bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation. After the reaction finishes, the
product(s) are released, and the active site returns to its original shape.
Enzyme activity, and thus the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, is regulated by environmental conditions, including
the amount of substrate, temperature, pH, and the presence
