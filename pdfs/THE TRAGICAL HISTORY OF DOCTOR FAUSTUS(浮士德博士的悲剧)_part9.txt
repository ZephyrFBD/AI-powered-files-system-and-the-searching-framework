else. He that is grounded in astrology, Enrich'd with
tongues, well seen in minerals, Hath all the principles magic doth require:
Then doubt not, Faustus, but to be renowm'd,<23> And more frequented
for this mystery Than heretofore the Delphian oracle. The spirits tell me
they can dry the sea, And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks, Yea, all
the wealth that our forefathers hid Within the massy entrails of the earth:
Then tell me, Faustus, what shall we three want?
FAUSTUS. Nothing, Cornelius.  O, this cheers my soul! Come, shew
me some demonstrations magical, That I may conjure in some bushy
grove, And have these joys in full possession.
VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove, And bear wise
Bacon's and Albertus'<24> works, The Hebrew Psalter, and New
Testament; And whatsoever else is requisite We will inform thee ere our
conference cease.
CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art; And then,
all other ceremonies learn'd, Faustus may try his cunning by himself.
