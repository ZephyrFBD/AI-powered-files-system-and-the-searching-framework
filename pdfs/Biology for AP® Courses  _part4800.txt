costs to human societies and
biodiversity will be high.
As already mentioned, the private non-profit sector plays a large role in the conservation effort both in North America and
around the world. The approaches range from species-specific organizations to the broadly focused IUCN and TRAFFIC.
The Nature Conservancy takes a novel approach. It purchases land and protects it in an attempt to set up preserves for

Establishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts. A preserve is an area of
