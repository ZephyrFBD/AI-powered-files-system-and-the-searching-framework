 missense mutation.
(d) Beta-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder in which less beta
globin is produced. Based on the information, explain how a point
mutation could cause beta-thalassemia. (1 point)
Explanation (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Beta-thalassemia is caused by a nonsense mutation. Specifically, it changes
codon 39 in the beta globin from CAG (gln) to UAG (STOP). The STOP
signal shortens the globin chain and makes it functionally useless. 
The mutation is a nonsense mutation that changes the codon to a chain-terminating codon.
