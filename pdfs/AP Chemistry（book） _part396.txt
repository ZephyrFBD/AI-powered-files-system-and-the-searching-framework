of mass.  
 (Section 2.1) The French noble-
man and scientist Antoine Lavoisier (Figure 3.1) discovered this important chemical law 
during the late 1700s. Lavoisier stated the law in this eloquent way: “We may lay it down as 
an incontestable axiom that, in all the operations of art and  
nature, nothing is created; an 
equal quantity of matter exists both before and after the experiment. Upon this principle, 
the whole art of performing chemical experiments depends.”* With the advent of Dalton’s 
atomic theory, chemists came to understand the basis for this law: Atoms are neither created nor 
destroyed during a chemical reaction. The changes that occur during any reaction merely rear-
range the atoms. The same collection of atoms is present both before and after the reaction.
3.1 ∣ Chemical Equations
We represent chemical reactions by chemical equations. When the gas hydrogen 1H22 
burns, for example, it reacts with oxygen 1O22 in the air to form water 1H2O2. We write 
the chemical e
