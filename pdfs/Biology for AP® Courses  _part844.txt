k this is the case?
Tremetol, a metabolic poison found in the white snake root plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate. When cows eat
this plant, it is concentrated in the milk they produce. Humans who consume the milk become ill. Symptoms of this
disease, which include vomiting, abdominal pain, and tremors, become worse after exercise. Why do you think this is
the case?
a.
Tremetol inhibits enzymes that convert lactate into less harmful compounds. Exercise worsens this by
producing more lactate.
b.
Tremetol increases the production of lactate dehydrogenase, causing lactic acid to accumulate in the body.
c.
Tremetol inhibits the production of NAD+ after exercise. The lack of oxygen causes lactic acid to accumulate
in the body.
d.
Tremetol binds to lactic acid, inhibiting its breakdown into other compounds and causing it to accumulate
after exercising.
Alcohol Fermentation
Another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation (Figure 7.16) that produces ethanol, an alcohol. Th
