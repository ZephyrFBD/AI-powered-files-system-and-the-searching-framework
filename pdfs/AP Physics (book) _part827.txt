 out 
to determine. At the same time, we will see that the relation
follows
directly from Newton’s second law,
We first examine a very simple case: a particle of mass m revolving in a circle
of radius r at the end of a string or rod whose mass we can ignore compared to m
(Fig.8–17). Consider a force F that acts on the mass m tangent to the circle as shown.
The torque that gives rise to an angular acceleration is 
If we use Newton’s
second law for linear quantities,
and Eq. 8–5 relating the angular
acceleration to the tangential linear acceleration,
then we have
When we multiply both sides of this equation by r, we find that the torque 
or
[single particle] (8;11)
Here at last we have a direct relation between the angular acceleration and the
applied torque 
The quantity 
represents the rotational inertia of the particle
and is called its moment of inertia.
