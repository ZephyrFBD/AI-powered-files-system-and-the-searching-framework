(D) A molecule with an uneven or a lopsided distribution of charges
is considered a polar molecule. A molecule where the charges are
balanced and distributed equally is nonpolar. Although each Câ€“H
bond within a molecule of CH4 is polar, the arrangement of the 4Hs
around the lone carbon is balanced, making the molecule nonpolar.
The bonds between oxygen atoms in O2 are nonpolar, and the
overall molecule is also balanced and nonpolar. A molecule of CO2
contains polar bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms, but the
arrangement of C and Os (O=C=O) is balanced. Therefore the
molecule is balanced and nonpolar. Water is a strongly polar
