CHAPTER 6 Electronic Structure of Atoms
Electron Spin and the Pauli Exclusion Principle
We have now seen that we can use hydrogen-like orbitals to describe many-electron 
 
atoms. What, however, determines which orbitals the electrons occupy? That is, how 
do the electrons of a many-electron atom populate the available orbitals? To answer this 
question, we must consider an additional property of the electron.
When scientists studied the line spectra of many-electron atoms in great detail, 
they noticed a very puzzling feature: Lines that were originally thought to be sin-
gle were actually closely spaced pairs. This meant, in essence, that there were twice 
as many  
energy levels as there were “supposed” to be. In 1925, the Dutch physicists 
George Uhlenbeck (1900–1988) and Samuel Goudsmit (1902–1978) proposed a solu-
tion to this
