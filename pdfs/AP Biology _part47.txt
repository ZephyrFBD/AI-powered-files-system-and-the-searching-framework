ld fewer hydrogen atoms than
saturated fatty acids. One exception is the group of tropical oils such as
coconut and palm oil that are saturated, somewhat solid at room
temperature, and are as unhealthy as are fats extracted from animals.
Steroids are lipids that do not have the same general structure as other
lipids. Instead, they consist of four fused carbon rings. Figure 2.9 shows
the steroid cholesterol. Other examples of steroids are testosterone and
estradiol.

Lipids serve many functions.
ENERGY STORAGE: One gram of any lipid will release 9 calories per
gram when burned in a calorimeter and produce twice the energy of
1 gram of carbohydrates or 1 gram of proteins.
STRUCTURAL: Phospholipids (a lipid in which a phosphate group
replaces one fatty acid) are a major component of the cell
membrane. One steroid, cholesterol, serves as an important
component of the plasma membrane of animal cells.
