e probability of the plant having purple flowers is  (and the
gene that determines tallness has no effect—is independent of—the gene that determines flower color), the
probability of the plant being tall AND having purple flowers is 
.
If the results of one event do affect the probability of a second event happening (mutually exclusive events), the
probability of both events happening equals the sum of their individual probabilities:
For example, in a heterozygous cross, the probability of a homozygous recessive offspring is  and the probability
of a heterozygous offspring is , so the probability of an offspring being either homozygous recessive OR
heterozygous is 
.
Hardy-Weinberg Equations
Use this equation when finding allele frequencies:
p is the frequency of the dominant allele.
q is the frequency of the recessive allele in the gene pool.
Use this equation when looking for genotype frequencies:
p2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype.
2pq is the frequency of the he
