amage from 
fracking is signiﬁcant. The large volume of fracking ﬂuid required to 
create a well must be returned to the surface. Without puriﬁcation 
the ﬂuid is rendered unﬁt for other uses, and becomes a large-scale 
environmental problem. Often the waste water is allowed to sit in 
open waste water pits. The 2005 Energy Policy act and other federal 
legislation exempts hydraulic fracturing operations from certain pro-
visions of the Safe Drinking Water act and other regulations. Some 
areas of the country that are already facing water shortages thus have 
one more large demand for a limited supply. Because fracturing of 
rock formations increases the pathways for ﬂows of petroleum and 
various gases, bodies of underground water that have been serving 
as municipal water supplies or wells for individual homes in some 
locales have become contaminated with petroleum, hydrogen sulﬁde 
and other toxic substances. The escape of a variety of gases, including 
methane and other hydrocarbo
