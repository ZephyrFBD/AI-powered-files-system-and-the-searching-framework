ensity-dependent inhibition means that when cells growing in
culture get crowded, they stop dividing. That is a feature of normal
cells growing in culture. Cancer cells do not demonstrate this
characteristic. That is why one trait of cancer cells is that they do not
stop dividing. In metaphase of meiosis I, chromosomes line up
double file, not single file. The process when chromosomes pair up
is called synapsis. They do this in preparation for crossing-over, not
the other way around. Cells in the intestine are not arrested. They
divide every day to replace cells that have been damaged during
digestion. (ENE-3)
(C) The cell cycle is tightly regulated by internal controls or
checkpoints. MPF triggers the cellâ€™s passage from G2 into mitosis,
the M phase. Choice A is not correct because normal cells spend
most of their time and energy in interphase (G1, S, and G2), not
dividing. Choice B is incorrect because interphase consists of G1, S,
and G2. Choice D is incorrect because cancer cells d
