e molecule, while the glycerol-phosphate head is hydrophilic. The phospholipids are arranged into a bilayer
formation with the hydrophilic heads pointing to the outside and the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the inside. As
a result, the plasma membrane is a barrier to most molecules. In plants, fungi, and bacteria, the membrane deposits
cellulose or other polysaccharides on the outside of the membrane to create a cell wall. The cell wall provides
support to the cell.
Embedded in the phospholipid bilayer are various proteins and, in animals cells, cholesterol molecules. This mixture
of molecules accounts for the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane, that is, a highly flexible lipid boundary
impregnated with various other molecules.
b. Interactions of plasma membrane with the outside environment: The plasma membrane is a selectively permeable
membrane. Small
 
molecules, like O2 and CO2, readily diffuse through the membrane.
The movement of larger molecules is regulated by protei
