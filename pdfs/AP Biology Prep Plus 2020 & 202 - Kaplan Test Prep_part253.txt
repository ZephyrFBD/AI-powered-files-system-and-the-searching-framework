 on a straw. The cohesive force of water keeps a steady flow of
water moving through the plant, pulled by the negative pressure
developed by transpiration occurring in the leaves. The force exerted in
the water column due to cohesion is as strong as steel wire of the same
diameter.
Plants need a mechanism to deliver the stored energy created during
photosynthesis to all of their structures. While water travels upward from
the roots through the xylem via the pull of transpiration and the cohesion
of water, nutrients flow both up and down through the phloem via the
pull of osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure is built up between areas
that have high concentrations of nutrients and those that have low
concentrations. Translocation of materials in the phloem is like long-
range diï¬€usion. Similar to the cohesion of water, lower solute pressure on
one end of a phloem vessel is translated along the narrow vessel to an
area where the solute pressure is greater. The adaptive significance of
these
