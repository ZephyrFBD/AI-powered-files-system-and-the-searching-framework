e balanced 
equation is
3Pd(NH3)3Cl4Cl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) ¡
 
3Pd(NH3)3Cl4NO3(aq) + AgCl(s)
 
This is a metathesis reaction 
 (Section 4.2) in which one of 
the cations is the 3Pd(NH3)3Cl4+ complex ion.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
When the compound RhCl3 # 4 NH3 is dissolved in water and 
treated with excess AgNO3(aq) one mole of AgCl(s) is formed 
for every mole of RhCl3 # 4 NH3. What is the correct way to 
write the formula of this compound? 
(a) 3Rh(NH3)4Cl34 (b) 3Rh(NH3)4Cl24Cl (c) 3Rh(NH3)4Cl4Cl2 
(d) 3Rh(NH3)44Cl3 (e) 3RhCl34(NH3)4
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Predict the number of ions produced per formula unit when 
the compound CoCl2 # 6 H2O dissolves in water to form an 
aqueous solution.

CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
Hydrated metal ions are complexes in which the ligand is water. Thus, Fe3+(aq) con-
sists largely of 3Fe(H2O)643+. 
 (Section 16.11) It is important to realize that ligands 
can undergo reaction. F
