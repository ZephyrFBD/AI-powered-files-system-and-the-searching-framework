ssue located at the tips of stems and roots, which enable a plant to extend in length. Lateral meristems facilitate growth
in thickness or girth in a maturing plant. Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots, at the bases of leaf blades and at
nodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem). This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the
leaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing.
Meristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue. Such cells take on specific
roles and lose their ability to divide further. They differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue.
Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant, and vascular tissue transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of
the plant. Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps
to store water and sugars.
