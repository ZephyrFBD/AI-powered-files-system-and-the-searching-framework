■ THE INVESTIGATIONS 
■ Getting Started: Prelab Assessment 
The replication of cells and organisms is a central concept in biology. Organisms must 
pass on their genetic material to their offspring. You can ask students how multicellular 
organisms grow during development and how they repair themselves and replace cells. A 
good example is what happens to epidermal (skin) cells to heal a cut. 
Chromosome movement during mitosis and meiosis is not easily understood. Ask 
students to think about this scenario: You have a plate filled with cooked spaghetti, all 
tangled together. Next to it is a plate of cooked macaroni. Which will you be able to pull 
apart into individual pieces more easily? Which is more likely to be tangled? Which 
is more likely to be broken as you separate the pieces? The point is that condensed 
chromosomes like the more compact macaroni are much more easily and safely moved 
than are elongated chromoso
