in sites
(a) Bacterial communities containing different species of bacteria are no different than other communities with
multiple species. Explain what factors contribute to a carrying capacity.
(b) Identify the two important controls that are used in this experiment. In addition, the experiment includes a
7-day waiting period between when the bacterial transplant takes place. Justify why this is necessary.
(c) Interpret the effect of the transplants between interdigital web space and the buttock, external auditory
canal, and plantar heel areas.
(d) If each deposition site is pretreated with known antibiotics, explain how this would likely affect the results.
2. Researchers were interested in the effect of temperature on the respiration rate of crickets. Three chambers
were prepared and kept at three different temperatures. A cricket was placed in each chamber. The CO2 levels
in the chamber were recorded at 0 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes to assess the changing levels of CO2
