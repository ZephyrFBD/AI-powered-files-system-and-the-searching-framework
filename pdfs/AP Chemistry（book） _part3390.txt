Radiotracers
Because radioisotopes can be detected readily, they can be used to follow an element 
through its chemical reactions. The incorporation of carbon atoms from CO2 into glucose 
during photosynthesis, for example, has been studied using CO2 enriched in carbon-14:
 
6 14CO2 + 6 H2O    
¡
Sunlight
Chlorophyll  14C6H12O6 + 6 O2 
[21.21]
Use of the carbon-14 label provides direct experimental evidence that carbon dioxide in 
the environment is chemically converted to glucose in plants. Analogous labeling exper-
iments using oxygen-18 show that the O2 produced during photosynthesis comes from 
water, not carbon dioxide. When it is possible to isolate and purify intermediates and 
products from reactions, detection devices such as scintillation counters can be used to 
“follow” the radioisotope as it moves from starting material through intermediates to
