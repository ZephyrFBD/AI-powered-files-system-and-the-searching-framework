acids. Which of these molecules provides the largest amount of free energy? Justify your answer.
7.7 | Regulation of Cellular Respiration
In this section, you will explore the following question:
•
What mechanisms control cellular respiration?
Connection for AP® Courses
Cellular respiration is controlled by a variety of means. For example, the entry of glucose into a cell is controlled by the
transport proteins that aid glucose passage through the cell membrane. However, most of the control of the respiration
processes is accomplished through negative feedback inhibition of specific enzymes that respond to the intracellular
concentrations of ATP, ADP, NAD+, and FAD, etc.
