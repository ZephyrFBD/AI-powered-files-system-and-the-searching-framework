g upon mild trauma would be expected.
In severe cases, individuals may have abnormal
bone formation as manifested by thinner and/or
shorter bones, perhaps resulting in a shorter
stature.
30. Osteoporosis is a clinical manifestation of an
imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation,
resulting in weakened bones that easily fracture. How may
one design a therapeutic drug targeting specific bone cell
type(s) for the treatment of osteoporosis?
a.
A therapeutic drug that inhibits osteoblast
activity would be useful. A drug that enhances
the bone formation activity of osteoclasts may
also be a good strategy.
b.
A therapeutic drug that inhibits osteoclast
activity would be useful. One that reduces the
activity of osteoblasts may also be a good
strategy.
c.
A therapeutic drug that inhibits osteoblast
activity would be useful. One that enhances the
bone formation activity of osteoblasts may also
be a good strategy.
d.
A therapeutic drug that inhibits osteoclast
activity would be useful.
