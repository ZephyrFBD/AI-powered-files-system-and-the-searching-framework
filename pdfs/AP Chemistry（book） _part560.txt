Sample Exercise 4.4 
Writing a Net Ionic Equation
Write the net ionic equation for the precipitation reaction that occurs when aqueous solutions of calcium chloride and sodium 
carbonate are mixed.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
What happens when you mix an aqueous solution of  
sodium nitrate with an aqueous solution of barium chloride? 
(a) There is no reaction; all possible products are soluble.  
(b) Only barium nitrate precipitates. 
(c) Only sodium chloride precipitates. 
(d) Both barium nitrate and sodium chloride precipitate. 
(e) Nothing; barium chloride is not soluble and it stays as a 
precipitate.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the net ionic equation for the precipitation reaction that 
occurs when aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and potassium 
phosphate are mixed.
