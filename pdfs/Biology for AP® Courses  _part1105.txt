 signaled by the
extracellular concentration of small amino acid
derivatives. To combat antibiotic resistance, an emerging
strategy for the control of bacterial disease is quorum
quenching.
A. Describe the advantage of antibiotics to the organisms
that produce them.
B. Based on the name of the emerging strategy for
controlling bacterial infections, describe a possible
mechanism by which bacteria determine their population
density. Justify the claim that quorum quenching may
provide a more sustainable approach to disease control
than the use of antibiotics.

REPRODUCTION
Figure 10.1 A sea urchin begins life as a single cell that (a) divides to form two cells, visible by scanning electron
microscopy. After four rounds of cell division, (b) there are 16 cells, as seen in this SEM image. After many rounds
of cell division, the individual develops into a complex, multi
