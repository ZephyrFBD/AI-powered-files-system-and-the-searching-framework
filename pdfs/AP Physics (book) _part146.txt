 zero. We can
write the definition of instantaneous velocity,
for one-dimensional motion as
[instantaneous velocity]
(2;3)
The notation
means the ratio
is to be evaluated in the limit of
approaching zero.†
For instantaneous velocity we use the symbol 
whereas for average
velocity we use 
with a bar above. In the rest of this book, when we use the
term “velocity” it will refer to instantaneous velocity. When we want to speak of
the average velocity, we will make this clear by including the word “average.”
Note that the instantaneous speed always equals the magnitude of the
instantaneous velocity. Why? Because distance traveled and the magnitude of
the displacement become the same when they become infinitesimally small.
If an object moves at a uniform (that is, constant) velocity during a partic-
ular time interval, then its instantaneous velocity at any instant is the same as its
average velocity (see Fig. 2–9a). But in many situations this is not the case. For
example, a car may start
