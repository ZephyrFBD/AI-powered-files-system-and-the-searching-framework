d asked to determine whether the reac-
tion is first or second order.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
For a certain reaction A ¡ products, a plot of ln[A] versus 
time produces a straight line with a slope of -3.0 * 10-2 s-1. 
Which of the following statements is or are true?
  (i) The reaction follows ﬁrst-order kinetics.
  (ii) The rate constant for the reaction is 3.0 * 10-2 s-1.
 
(iii) The initial concentration of [A] was 1.0 M.
(a) Only one of the statements is true.
(b) Statements (i) and (ii) are true.
(c) Statements (i) and (iii) are true.
(d) Statements (ii) and (iii) are true.
(e) All three statements are true.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
The decomposition of NO2 discussed in the Sample Exercise 
is second order in NO2 with k = 0.543 M -1 s-1. If the initial 
concentration of NO2 in a closed vessel is 0.0500 M, what is 
the concentration of this reactant after 0.500 h?
