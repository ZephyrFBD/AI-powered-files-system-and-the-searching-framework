t
because the carbon dioxide needed for the Calvin cycle is absorbed from the atmosphere and the Calvin cycle
does not produce oxygen. Choice (D) is incorrect because the light-dependent reactions send NADPH to the
Calvin cycle and the Calvin cycle returns NADP+ to the light-dependent reactions.
10. (D) NADP+ is the final electron acceptor in the light-dependent reactions. NADP+ becomes NADPH after
accepting electrons. Choice (A) is incorrect because oxygen is the final electron acceptor in cellular respiration,
not photosynthesis. Water does not function as an electron acceptor, so choice (B) is incorrect. NAD+ is not
used in photosynthesis; it is used in cellular respiration. Thus, choice (C) is incorrect.

11. (a) Photosynthetic algae are autotrophs—they make their own food and are consumed by other organisms.
(b) Kleptoplasty would give Elysia crispata a survival advantage because the chloroplasts that remained
functional in the Elysia crispata’s cells would prov
