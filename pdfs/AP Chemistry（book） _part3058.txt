onstant temperature 
and pressure and that we have a catalyst that allows the reaction to proceed at a reason-
able rate. What happens when we load the vessel with a certain number of moles of N2 
and three times that number of moles of H2? As we saw in Figure 15.4, the N2 and H2 react 
spontaneously to form NH3 until equilibrium is achieved. Similarly, Figure 15.4 shows 
that if we load the vessel with pure NH3, it decomposes spontaneously to N2 and H2 until 
equilibrium is reached. In each case, the free energy of the system gets progressively lower 
and lower as the reaction moves toward equilibrium, which represents a minimum in the 
free energy. We illustrate these cases in Figure 19.15.

Are the processes that move 
a system toward equilibrium 
spontaneous or nonspontaneous?
