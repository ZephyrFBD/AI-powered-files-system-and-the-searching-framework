is not 
just a hypothetical question. 
 The fate of dozens of companies, hundreds of patents, and 
billions of dollars’ worth of research and development money depend on the answer. 
Biotechnology makes it possible for humans to engineer heritable changes in DNA, and 
this investigation provides an opportunity for you to explore the ethical, social, and 
medical issues surrounding the manipulation of genetic information. 
■ Learning Objective 
•  IST-1.P: Explain the use of genetic engineering techniques in analyzing or  
manipulating DNA.  
■ General Safety Precautions 
Never handle gels with your bare hands. An electrophoresis apparatus can be dangerous 
because it is filled with a highly conductive salt solution and uses DC current at a 
voltage strong enough to cause a small shock. Always turn the power supply switch
