ss energy.
ii. The energy released can be used for reactions that require energy.
2. Endergonic reactions require free energy.
i.
In anabolic reactions, reactant(s) are joined to produce product(s) containing more energy.
ii. The free energy required by anabolic reactions is often provided by ATP produced in catabolic
reactions.
3. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) carries energy in its high-energy phosphate bonds.
i.
ATP is formed from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate.
ii. Conversely, when ATP is broken down into ADP and Pi via hydrolysis, energy is released
(exergonic) that can be used in endergonic reactions.
iii. In addition, ATP can donate one of its phosphate groups to a molecule, such as a substrate or a
protein, to energize it or cause it to change its shape.
4. Living systems require a consistent input of free energy and an ordered system.
i.
This free energy input allows for a systemâ€™s order to be maintained.
ii. If either order in the system or free energy flow
