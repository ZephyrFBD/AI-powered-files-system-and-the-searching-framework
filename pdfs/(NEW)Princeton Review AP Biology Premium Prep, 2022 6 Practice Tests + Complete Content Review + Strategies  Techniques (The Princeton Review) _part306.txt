t is condensed and visible. In every female cell, one X chromosome is activated and the other
X chromosome is deactivated during embryonic development. Surprisingly, the X chromosome destined to be
inactivated is randomly chosen in each cell. Therefore, in every tissue in the adult female, one X chromosome
remains condensed and inactive. However, this X chromosome is replicated and passed on to a daughter cell. X-
inactivation is the reason it is okay that females have two X chromosomes and males have only one. After X-
inactivation, it is like everyone has one copy.
Other Inheritance Patterns
Not all patterns of inheritance obey the principles of Mendelian genetics. In fact, many traits we observe are due to a
combined expression of alleles. Here are a couple of examples of non-Mendelian forms of inheritance:
Incomplete dominance (blending inheritance): In some cases, the traits will blend. For example, if you cross
a white snapdragon plant (genotype WW) with a red snapdragon plant (R
