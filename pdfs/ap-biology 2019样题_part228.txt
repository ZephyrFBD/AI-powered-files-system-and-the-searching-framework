ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.N
Explain how changes in 
energy availability affect 
populations and ecosystems.
ENE-1.O 
Explain how the activities of 
autotrophs and heterotrophs 
enable the flow of energy 
within an ecosystem.
ENE-1.N.1
Changes in energy availability can result in 
changes in population size.
ENE.1.N.2
Changes in energy availability can result in 
disruptions to an ecosystem—
a. A change in energy resources such as 
sunlight can affect the number and size of 
the trophic levels.
b. A change in the producer level
