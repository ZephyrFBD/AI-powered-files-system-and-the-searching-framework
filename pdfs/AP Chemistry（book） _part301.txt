oxygen by the chemical formula O2 (read “oh two”). The subscript tells us that two 
oxygen atoms are present in each molecule. A molecule made up of two atoms is called a 
diatomic molecule.
Oxygen also exists in another molecular form known as ozone. Molecules of ozone 
consist of three oxygen atoms, making the chemical formula O3. Even though “normal” 
oxygen 1O22 and ozone 1O32 are both composed only of oxygen atoms, they exhibit very 
different chemical and physical properties. For example, O2 is essential for life, but O3 is 
toxic; O2 is odorless, whereas O3 has a sharp, pungent smell.
The elements that normally occur as diatomic molecules are hydrogen, oxygen, 
nitrogen, and the halogens 1H2, O2, N2, F2, Cl2, Br2, and I22. Except for hydrogen, these 
diatomic elements are clustered on the right side of the periodic table.
Compounds composed of molecules contain more than one type of atom and 
are called molecular compounds. A molecule of the compound methane, for 
example, co
