y’s own cells or tissues. Other example of autoimmune diseases include type I
diabetes and ALS. In the rejection of transplanted organs, the immune system is responding to unmatched MHC proteins
on the cells of the donated (“non-self”) organ. However, the immune system usually responds as it should, defending you
against infection and getting you back to your AP® Biology class as soon as possible.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.

Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce,
and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.
