es its strategy for maximum fitness. Reproductive success, a measure of
fitness, depends upon four variables: the age of reproductive maturity, the frequency of reproduction, the number of
offspring per reproductive event, and how long the organism lives. There are various ways in which these four
variables can combine to maximize fitness given the resources available under different environmental conditions.
In general, two major strategies emerge, as follows:
1. An r-selected species exhibits rapid growth (J-shaped curve). This type of reproductive strategy is characterized
by opportunistic species, such as grasses and many insects, that quickly invade a habitat, quickly reproduce, and
then die. They produce many offspring that are small, mature quickly, and require little, if any, parental care.
2. A K-selected species exhibits logistic growth (S-shaped curve), and the size of a mature population remains
relatively constant (at the carrying capacity, K). Species of this type, such a
