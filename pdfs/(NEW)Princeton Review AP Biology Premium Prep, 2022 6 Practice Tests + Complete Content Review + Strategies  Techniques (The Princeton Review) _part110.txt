give you more time for each question. How? By having you slow down and answer fewer questions.
Slowing down and doing well on the questions you do answer is the best way to improve your score on the AP
Biology Exam. Rushing through questions in order to finish, on the other hand, will always hurt your score. When
you rush, you’re far more likely to make careless errors, misread, and fall into traps. Keep in mind that blank
answers are not counted against you.
3 is the Magic Number
Using the Three-Pass System will help you earn more points by doing the
questions you know first and saving the ones you don’t know for last.
THE THREE-PASS SYSTEM
The AP Biology Exam covers a broad range of topics. There’s no way, even with our extensive review, that you will
know everything about every topic in biology. So what should you do?
Do the Easiest Questions First
The best way to rack up points is to focus on the questions you find the easiest. If you know the answer, nail it and
move on. Oth
