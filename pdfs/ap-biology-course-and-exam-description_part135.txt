Describe the components 
of a signal transduction 
pathway.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-3.C.1
Signal transduction pathways link signal 
reception with cellular responses.
IST-3.C.2
Many signal transduction pathways include 
protein modification and phosphorylation 
cascades.

Introduction to 
Signal Transduction
IST-3.D
Describe the role of 
components of a signal 
transduction pathway 
in producing a cellular 
response.
IST-3.D.1
Signaling begins with the recognition of a 
chemical messenger—a ligand—by a receptor 
protein in a target cell— 
a. The ligand-binding domain of a receptor 
recognizes a specific chemical messenger, 
which can be a peptide, a small chemical, or 
protein, in a specific one-to-one relationship.
b. G protein-coupled receptors are an example 
of a receptor protein in eukaryotes.
IST-3.D.2
Signaling cascades relay signals from 
receptors to cell targets, often amplifying 
the incoming signals, resulting
