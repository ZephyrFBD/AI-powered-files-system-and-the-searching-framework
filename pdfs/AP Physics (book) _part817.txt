ics—the description of rotational
motion in terms of angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration.
Now we discuss the dynamics, or causes, of rotational motion. Just as we found
analogies between linear and rotational motion for the description of motion, so
rotational equivalents for dynamics exist as well.
To make an object start rotating about an axis clearly requires a force. But 
the direction of this force, and where it is applied, are also important. Take, for
example, an ordinary situation such as the overhead view of the door in Fig. 8–10.
If you apply a force
perpendicular to the door as shown, you will find that the
greater the magnitude,
the more quickly the door opens. But now if you apply
the same force at a point closer to the hinge—say,
in Fig. 8–10—the door 
will not open so quickly. The effect of the force is less: where the force acts, as
well as its magnitude and direction, affects how quickly the door opens. Indeed,
if only this one force acts, the
