 the lengths of the mRNAs vary from tissue to tissue,
but is consistent among muscle cells of the same type.
Which of the following provides the best explanation for the
results obtained by the researchers?
The mRNA molecules exhibit diﬀerent levels of stability.
(A)
The mRNA molecules may have diﬀerent levels of
polyadenylation.
(B)
The mRNA molecules may undergo diﬀerent alternative
splicing patterns.
(C)
The mRNA molecules are capped by a methyl guanine in
some tissues but not in others.
(D)
11. Scientists have isolated an mRNA molecule that is a potential
candidate for encoding a small peptide growth factor. They know
that the mRNA sequence that encodes this peptide is 156
nucleotides long, including start and stop codons. Which of the
following peptides could be encoded by the mRNA?
A peptide that contains 52 amino acids
(A)
A peptide that contains 51 amino acids
(B)
A peptide that contains 462 amino acids
(C)
A peptide that contains 468 amino acids
(D)
