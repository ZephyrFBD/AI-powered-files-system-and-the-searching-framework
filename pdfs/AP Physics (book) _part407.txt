 plane, along the y axis in Fig. 4–33.
EXERCISE H Is the normal force always perpendicular to an inclined plane? Is it always
vertical?
The skier. The skier in Fig. 4–34a has begun descending the
30° slope. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.10, what is her acceleration?
APPROACH We choose the x axis along the slope, positive downslope in the
direction of the skier’s motion. The y axis is perpendicular to the surface. The
forces acting on the skier are gravity,
which points vertically down-
ward (not perpendicular to the slope), and the two forces exerted on her skis by
the snow—the normal force perpendicular to the snowy slope (not vertical), and
the friction force parallel to the surface. These three forces are shown acting 
at one point in Fig. 4–34b, which is our free-body diagram for the skier.
SOLUTION We have to resolve only one vector into components, the weight 
and its components are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 4–34c. To be general, we
use 
rather than 30° for now.
