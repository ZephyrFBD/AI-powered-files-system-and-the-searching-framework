recommend that you 
and your students wear gloves to prevent staining of the skin.

■ Adding Methylene Blue Stain to Buffer 
If you add stain to the gel, also add stain to the buffer. Use Table 2 to determine how 
much stain to add to either 500 mL or 2.6 L of 1x TAE electrophoresis buffer. However, if 
you plan to reuse the buffer, do not add stain to the buffer.

■ Staining with Final Stain 
Methylene blue stain is added to the gel and buffer in order to better visualize the bands 
(fragments) of DNA as they migrate through the agarose gel during electrophore
