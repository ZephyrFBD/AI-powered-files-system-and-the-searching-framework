Origins of Cell 
Compartmentalization
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
EVO-1
Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population over 
time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
EVO-1.A
Describe similarities 
and/or differences in 
compartmentalization 
between prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic cells.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.A.1
Membrane-bound organelles evolved 
from once free-living prokaryotic cells via 
endosymbiosis.
EVO-1.A.2
Prokaryotes generally lack internal membrane-
bound organelles but have internal regions with 
specialized structures and functions.
EVO-1.A.3
Eukaryotic cells maintain internal membranes 
that partition the cell into specialized regions.
EVO-1.B
Describe the relationship 
between the functions of 
endosymbiotic organelles 
and their free-living ancestral 
counterparts.
EVO-1.B.1
Membrane-bound organelles evolved from 
previously free-living prokaryotic ce
