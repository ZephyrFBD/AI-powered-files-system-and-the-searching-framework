■ Data Analysis 
From the data, students should consider several questions: 
•  Which surface area-to-volume ratio gave the fastest diffusion rate? 
•  Which surface area-to-volume ratio had the greatest diffusion depth? 
•  How might a cell’s shape influence the rate of diffusion? 
•  What factors affect the rate of diffusion and how can these be tested? 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Using the provided materials, students design and conduct an experiment(s) to test the 
predictions they made regarding the relationship of surface area and volume in artificial 
cells to the diffusion rate using the phenolphthalein–NaOH agar and HCl solution. 
Procedure 2: Modeling Diffusion and Osmosis 
Students create models of living cells using dialysis tubing. Dialysis tubing contains 
pores that permit the
