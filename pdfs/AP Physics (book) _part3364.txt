FIGURE 30–7 Enrico Fermi, as
portrayed on a US postage stamp.
Fermi contributed significantly to
both theoretical and experimental
physics, a feat almost unique in
modern times: statistical theory of
identical particles that obey the
exclusion principle (
fermions);
theory of the weak interaction and 
decay; neutron physics; induced
radioactivity and new elements; first
nuclear reactor; first resonance of
particle physics; led and inspired a
vast amount of other nuclear
research.

In 
decay, it is the weak nuclear force that plays the crucial role. The neu-
trino is unique in that it interacts with matter only via the weak force, which is
why it is so hard to detect.
Decay
Many isotopes decay by electron emission. They are always isotopes that have
too many neutrons compared to the number of protons. That is, they
