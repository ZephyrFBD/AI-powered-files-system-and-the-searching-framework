e (rust). The
energy of the pressurized air is released to the surrounding atmosphere
as the balloon deflates. These examples have a common denominator: in
each of them, energy of some form is going from being localized or
concentrated to being spread out or dispersed.
The Third Law of Thermodynamics
According to the third law, the entropy of a system approaches a constant
value as the temperature approaches zero. Therefore, at absolute zero
(the coldest possible temperature), entropy reaches its minimum value.
At absolute zero, nothing can be colder and no heat energy remains in a
system.
BIOENERGETICS
Biological thermodynamics, also known as bioenergetics, is the study of
energy transformation in biology. This involves looking at energy
transformations and transductions in and between living things,
including their major functions down to the cellular level, and
understanding the function of the chemical processes underlying these
transductions.
