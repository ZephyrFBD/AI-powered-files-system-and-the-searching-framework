ke the number of electrons lost 
in the oxidation half-reaction equal the number of electrons gained in the reduc-
tion half-reaction.
 
4. Add half-reactions and, if possible, simplify by canceling species appearing on both 
sides of the combined equation.
 
5. Check to make sure that atoms and charges are balanced.
As an example, let’s consider the reaction between permanganate ion 1MnO4
-2 and 
oxalate ion 1C2O4
2-2 in acidic aqueous solution (Figure 20.2). When MnO4
- is added to 
an acidified solution of C2O4
2-, the deep purple color of the MnO4
- ion fades, bubbles 
of CO2 form, and the solution takes on the pale pink color of Mn2+. We can write the 
skeleton equation as
 
MnO4
-1aq2 + C2O4
2-1aq2 ¡ Mn2+1aq2 + CO21aq2 
[20.6]
Experiments show that H+ is consumed and H2O is produced in the reaction. We will see 
that their involvement in the reaction is deduced in the course of balancing the equation.
To complete and balance Equation 20.6, we first write the two half-reactions (S
