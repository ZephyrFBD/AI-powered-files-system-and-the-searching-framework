A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products;
other genes code for RNA products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes “on” or “off.”
The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus
but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is the messenger RNA (mRNA).
Other types of RNA—like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA—are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.
DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a
polynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-
carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (Figure 3.33). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule,
which is attached to one or more phosphate groups.
