,
which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of
one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the male gametes
(sperm) to the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes
(ova) below. To prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, Mendel
painstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plantâ€™s flowers before they had a chance to mature.
Plants used in first-generation crosses were called P0, or parental generation one, plants (Figure 12.3). Mendel collected the
seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were
called the F1, or the first filial (filial = offspring, daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics
in the F1 generation of plants,
