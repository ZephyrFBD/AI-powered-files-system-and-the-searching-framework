 breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more
pepsinogen, starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin. Another cell type—parietal cells—secretes
hydrogen and chloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the
stomach juices. Hydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin. The highly acidic environment also
kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of
protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach. Contraction and relaxation of
smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture
is called chyme. Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine. Further protein digestion takes place in the small
intestine. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hour
