(a) Caproic acid, responsible for the odor of dirty socks, is 
composed of C, H, and O atoms. Combustion of a 0.225-g 
sample of this compound produces 0.512 g CO2 and 
0.209 g H2O. What is the empirical formula of caproic acid? 
(b) Caproic acid has a molar mass of 116 g/mol. What is its 
molecular formula?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The compound dioxane, which is used as a solvent in vari-
ous industrial processes, is composed of C, H, and O atoms. 
Combustion of a 2.203-g sample of this compound produces 
4.401 g CO2 and 1.802 g H2O. A separate experiment shows 
that it has a molar mass of 88.1 g>mol. Which of the follow-
ing is the correct molecular formula for dioxane? 
(a) C2H4O (b) C4H4O2 (c) CH2 (d) C4H8O2
