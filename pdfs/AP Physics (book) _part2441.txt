 Fig. 22–4b. While the charges are flowing, a current exists whose
direction is indicated by the black arrows. A magnetic field is therefore produced
near the antenna. The magnetic field lines encircle the rod-like antenna and there-
fore, in Fig. 22–4,
points into the page 
on the right and out of the page 
on the left. Now we ask, how far out do these electric and magnetic fields extend?
In the static case, the fields would extend outward indefinitely far. However, when
the switch in Fig. 22–4 is closed, the fields quickly appear nearby, but it takes time 
for them to reach distant points. Both electric and magnetic fields store energy,
and this energy cannot be transferred to distant points at infinite speed.
