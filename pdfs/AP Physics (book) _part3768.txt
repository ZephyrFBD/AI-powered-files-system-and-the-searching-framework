magnification of space (according to inflation) and the very short time over
which it occurred 
Inflation helps us too with the puzzle of why magnetic monopoles (Section 20–1)
have never been observed, yet isolated magnetic poles may well have been 
copiously produced at the start. After inflation, they would have been so far apart
that we have never stumbled on one.
Inflation may solve outstanding problems, but we may need new physics to
understand how inflation occurred. Many predictions of inflationary theory have
been confirmed by recent cosmological observations.
33–9 Dark Matter and Dark Energy
According to the Standard Big Bang Model, the universe is evolving and changing.
Individual stars are being created, evolving, and then dying to become white
dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. At the same time, the universe as a whole is
expanding. One important question is whether the universe will continue to
expand forever. Until the late 1990s, the universe was thought to be dom
