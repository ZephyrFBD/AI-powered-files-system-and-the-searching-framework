byproduct.

Carbon dioxide undergoes reduction and water undergoes
oxidation. In the process, oxygen gas is made as the primary
food source for the plant, and glucose is released as a
byproduct.

All of life as we know it needs water. Waterâ€™s ability to form up to 4
hydrogen bonds gives it many unique properties. Hydrogen bonds form
when a hydrogen bound to a nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), or fluorine (F)
interacts with a lone pair of electrons on another nitrogen, oxygen, or
fluorine. The oxygen atoms shown on both a fatty acid (Figure I) and a
phospholipid (Figure II) have a lone pair of electrons available for
hydrogen bonding. The long chains of carbon and hydrogen shown
toward the bottom of both figures do not contain such lone pairs, nor do
