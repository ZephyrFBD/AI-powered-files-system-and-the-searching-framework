As they must, the formal charges in all three structures 
sum to 1-, the overall charge of the ion.
(b) The dominant Lewis structure generally produces 
formal charges of the smallest magnitude (guideline 
1). That eliminates the left structure as the dominant 
one. Further, as discussed in Section 8.4, N is more 
In Chapter 4 we introduced the rules for assigning oxidation num-
bers to atoms. The concept of electronegativity is the basis of these 
numbers. An atomâ€™s oxidation number is the charge the atom would 
have if its bonds were completely ionic. That is, in determining oxi-
dation number, all shared electrons are counted with the more elec-
tronegative a
