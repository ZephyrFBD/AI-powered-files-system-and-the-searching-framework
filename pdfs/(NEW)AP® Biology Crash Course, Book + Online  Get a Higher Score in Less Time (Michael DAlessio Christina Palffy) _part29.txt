Concepts
A. All organisms are made up of one or more cells.
B. The cell is the basic unit of structure and function of organisms.
C. New cells arise only from existing cells by cell reproduction.
D. Cells exchange substances with their environment by transporting these substances in and out of the cell
across the plasma membrane.

Types of Cells—Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic
A. Prokaryotic cells are simpler and more ancient than eukaryotic cells. The following are prokaryotes’
important characteristics:
1. No nucleus, only a nucleoid region with one, circular DNA.
2. No membrane-bound organelles.
3. Have a cell wall.
4. Like eukaryotes, prokaryotes contain a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes (location of
protein synthesis).
5. No histones or no formation of chromosomes.
B. Eukaryotic cells are those of protists, fungi, plants, and animals. They contain the following
characteristics:
1. Contain a nucleus, a nuclear envelope to protect DNA, nuclear pores to allow transport into a
