that live in the same geographic
area.
B. Species richness, species diversity, and community stability are major characteristics of communities.
C. Species interactions and competition for resources are the bases for community relationships.
D. A succession of different communities occurs over time on newly created areas or in habitats destroyed by
natural disasters or human activities.
II.
Species Richness and Diversity
A. Species Richness—includes the number of different species in a community; Species Diversity—includes
not only the number of each species, but the size of each population.
1. Species richness increases as latitude decreases.
i.
Communities closest to the equator, such as those found in tropical rain forests, have the greatest
number of species.
ii. Three hypotheses may explain the greater number of species in lower latitudes.
More available sunlight year-round promotes higher primary productivity—plant or
phytoplankton growth—resulting in a greater base level at the
