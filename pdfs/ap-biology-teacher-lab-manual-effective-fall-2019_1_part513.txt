itor the incubation conditions and bacterial growth/transformation. 
Allow approximately one class period (45–60 minutes) for students to observe 
transformants and controls, analyze and interpret results, and calculate transformation 
efficiency. One option is to assign postlab assessment questions for homework, although 
student collaboration is recommended. 
Day 4+ 
Allow one or two class periods for students to design and conduct an independent 
investigation. Time will be needed for post experimental observation and data analysis. 
In addition, students should be given time to present their results to peers. 
If students have performed colony transformation experiments before, they may 
review Procedure and proceed to the independent investigation(s). 
 However, it is 
recommended that all students read the background information and work through
