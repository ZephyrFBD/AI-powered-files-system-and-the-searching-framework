CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
25. Why is it beneficial for cells to use ATP rather than
directly using the energy stored in the bonds of
carbohydrates to power cellular reactions? What are the
greatest drawbacks to harnessing energy from the bonds of
several different compounds?
a.
ATP is readily available in the form of a single
unit that provides a consistent, appropriate
amount of energy. The cell would need to tailor
each reaction to each energy source if it
harvested ene
