electrons. There are four electrons in bonding orbitals and two in antibonding orbitals, 
so the bond order is 1
214 - 22 = 1. The molecule has a single bond, in agreement with its 
Lewis structure.
Because both the s
1s and s
1s
*  MOs of Li2 are completely filled, the 1s orbitals contribute 
almost nothing to the bonding. The single bond in Li2 is due essentially to the interaction 
of the valence 2s orbitals on the Li atoms. This example illustrates the general rule that core 
electrons usually do not contribute significantly to bonding in molecules. The rule is equivalent 
to using only the valence electrons when drawing Lewis structures. Thus, we need not con-
sider further the 1s orbitals while discussing the other period 2 diatomic molecules.
The MO description of Be2 follows readily from the energy-level diagram for Li2. 
Each Be atom has four electrons 11s22s22, so we must place eight electrons in molecular 
orbitals. Therefore, we completely fill the s
1s, s1s
* , s
2s, and s
