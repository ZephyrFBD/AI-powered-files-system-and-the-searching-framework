â–² Figure 23.4 Aqueous solutions of transition metal ions. Left to right: Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and 
Zn2+. The counterion is nitrate in all cases.
Figure 23.5 shows the common nonzero oxidation states for the 
period 4 transition metals. The +2 oxidation state, which is common 
for most transition metals, is due to the loss of the two outer 4s elec-
trons. This oxidation state is found for all these elements except Sc, 
where the 3+ ion with an [Ar] configuration is particularly stable.
Oxidation states above +2 are due to successive losses of 3d elec-
trons. From Sc through Mn the maximum oxidation state increases 
from +3 to +7, equaling in each case the total number of 4s plus 3d 
electrons in the atom. Thus, manganese has a maximum oxidation 
state of 2 + 5 = +7. As we move to the right beyond Mn in Figure 23.5, 
the maximum oxidation state decreases. This decrease is due to the 
attraction of d orbital electrons to the nucleus, which increases faster 
than the attraction
