ons. ATP synthesis (ΔG = 57
kJ/mol) is an endergonic reaction. The breakdown of glucose via
cellular respiration and ATP synthesis is the only pair that couples an
exergonic reaction with the endergonic reaction, so the correct answer
is (D). (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they couple two exergonic
reactions.
46. C
The cross produces only red-eyed flies, which means that at least one
of the parents must have had a homozygous dominant genotype for
eye color (RR). This rules out (D), a dihybrid cross that would produce
some flies with white eyes. With wings, the ratio of straight to curly is
about 3 to 1, which suggests that both parents must have been
heterozygous for wings (Ww). This eliminates (A) and (B), meaning that
(C) must be correct. This can be confirmed by a Punnet square of (C),
as shown below, which produces all red-eyed flies and a 3 to 1 ratio of
straight to curly.
