ssortment of homologous
chromosomes, crossing over, or random fertilization.
B. The first two genetic recombination events occur during meiosis I.
1. Independent assortment of homologous chromosomes—occurs during metaphase I and anaphase I,
creating a variety of outcomes (gametes) that contain different combinations of an organism’s
maternal and paternal chromosomes.
2. Crossing over—occurs between homologous chromosomes during prophase I, creating entirely new
chromosomes on which the organism’s maternal DNA is mixed with his or her paternal DNA so that
newly created chromosomes may be passed on to offspring.
C. Random fertilization creates further genetic variation.
1. One sperm, out of the large variety of sperm a male can produce, joins with any of the large number of
different eggs a female can produce.
2. This creates a large variety of different possible offspring.
