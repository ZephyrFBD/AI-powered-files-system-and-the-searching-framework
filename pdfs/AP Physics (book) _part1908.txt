Just
before the contraction of heart muscles, changes occur in the cell wall, so that posi-
tive ions on the exterior of the cell are able to pass through the wall and neutralize
charge on the inside, or even make the inside surface slightly positive compared to the
exterior. This “depolarization” starts at one end of the cell and progresses toward the
opposite end, as indicated by the arrow in Fig.17–38b, until the whole muscle is depolar-
ized; the muscle then repolarizes to its original state (Fig. 17–38a), all in less than a
second. Figure 17–38c shows rough graphs of the potential V as a function of time at
the two points P and 
(on either side of this cell) as the depolarization moves across
the cell. The path of depolarization within the heart as a whole is more complicated,
and produces the complex potential difference as a function of time, Fig. 17–37.
