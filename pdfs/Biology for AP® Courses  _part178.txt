bon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel
each other out.
Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions
Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break. Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which
determines their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can
also form between molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.
Without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-
sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.
When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because
hydrogenâ€™s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is
slightly positive, it will be attracted to n
