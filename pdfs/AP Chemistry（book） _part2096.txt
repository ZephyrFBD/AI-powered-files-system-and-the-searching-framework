CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
There are many interesting biological examples of osmosis. A cucumber placed in 
concentrated brine loses water via osmosis and shrivels into a pickle. People who eat a 
lot of salty food retain water in tissue cells and intercellular space because of osmosis. 
The resultant swelling or puffiness is called edema. Water moves from soil into plant roots 
partly because of osmosis. Bacteria on salted meat or candied fruit lose water through 
osmosis, shrivel, and die—thus preserving the food.
Give It Some Thought
Is the osmotic pressure of a 0.10 M solution of NaCl greater than, less than, or 
equal to that of a 0.10 M solution of KBr?
Determination of Molar Mass from Colligative Properties
The colligative properties of solutions provide a useful means of determining the molar 
mass of solutes. Any of the four colligat
