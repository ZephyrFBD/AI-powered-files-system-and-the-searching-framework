s observed. We will 
find it helpful to keep this analogy in mind as we discuss trends in effective nuclear charge.
Let’s consider what we would expect for the magnitude of Zeff for the sodium 
atom. Sodium has the electron configuration 3Ne43s1. The nuclear charge is Z = 11+, 
and there are 10 core electrons 11s22s22p62, which serve as a “lampshade” to screen 
the nuclear charge “seen” by the 3s electron. Therefore, in the simplest approach, we 
expect S to equal 10 and the 3s electron to experience an effective nuclear charge of 
Zeff = 11 - 10 = 1+ (Figure 7.3). The situation is more complicated, however, because 
the 3s electron has a small probability of being very close to the nucleus, in the region 
occupied by the core electrons. 
 (Section 6.6) Thus, this electron experiences 
a greater net attraction than our simple S = 10 model suggests: The actual value of 
Zeff for the 3s electron in Na is Zeff = 2.5+. In other words, because there is a small
