anisms may not be able
to adapt and may become extinct. If change is slower, animals
may be able to adapt. What would be required for the cod to be
able to adapt to the changing conditions described above?
The cod would need genetic variation in genes associated
with water acidity.
(A)
The cod would need genetic variation in genes allowing them
to metabolize carbon dioxide more eﬀiciently.
(B)
The cod would need to learn how to consume food more
eﬀiciently.
(C)
The cod would need to move to cooler locations in order to
survive.
(D)
4. RNA is well known as an information molecule. However, RNA can
also have enzymatic functions. Ribozymes are enzymes made of
RNA. The RNA world hypothesis states that early life used RNA as
both information molecules and catalysts. The hypothesis also
says that DNA and protein evolved later. DNA is a more durable
information molecule than RNA. Protein is a more versatile
structural and catalytic molecule than RNA. Except for some RNA
viruses, DNA is the mo
