23. (II) An electron starts from rest 24.5 cm from a fixed point
charge with
How fast will the electron 
be moving when it is very far away?
24. (II) Two identical 
point charges are initially
5.3 cm from each other. If they are released at the same
instant from rest, how fast will each be moving when they
are very far away from each other? Assume they have
identical masses of 1.0 mg.
25. (II) Two point charges,
and 
are placed
4.0 cm apart on the x axis. At what points along the x axis
is (a) the electric field zero and (b) the potential zero?

from a great distance apart to 
from one
