t only for
transverse waves, and not for longitudinal waves such as sound. The latter oscillate
only along the direction of motion, and neither orientation of slit would stop them.

Maxwell’s theory of light as electromagnetic (EM) waves predicted that light can
be polarized since an EM wave is a transverse wave. The direction of polarization in
a plane-polarized EM wave is taken as the direction of the electric field vector 
Light is not necessarily polarized. It can also be unpolarized, which means
that the source has oscillations in many planes at once, as shown in Fig. 24–40.
Ordinary lightbulbs emit unpolarized light, as does the Su
