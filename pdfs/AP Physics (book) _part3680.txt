ar can be determined by observing
its gravitational effects on other visible objects. Many stars are part of a cluster, the simplest being
a binary star in which two stars orbit around each other, allowing their masses to be determined using
rotational mechanics.
Careful study of nearby stars has shown that the luminosity for most stars
depends on the mass: the more massive the star, the greater its luminosity†.
Another important parameter of a star is its surface temperature, which can be
determined from the spectrum of electromagnetic frequencies it emits. As we
saw in Chapter 27, as the temperature of a body increases, the spectrum shifts
from predominantly lower frequencies (and longer wavelengths, such as red) to
higher frequencies (and shorter wavelengths such as blue). Quantitatively, the
relation is given by Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2): the wavelength 
at the peak of the
spectrum of light emitted by a blackbody (we often approximate stars as
blackbodies) is inversely proportional to
