limited or no justification for the predictions. The student 
likely does not consider possible positive effects on the 
community and is unable to explain with much coherence 
why populations and communities with species diversity 
(e.g., a prairie) are better able to withstand change to

Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 1
10 points maximum; 1 point for each specific prediction. A maximum of 3 points  
can be earned in any one section.
(Part a) 1 point for each reasonable resulting change to a cellular process. 
Effects may include:
• 
Less ATP produced. 
• 
Less NADPH produced. 
• 
Inability to fix carbon via Calvin cycle without products of electron 
transport chain.
• 
Decrease in O2 production. 
(Part b) 1 point for each reasonable expected change to an individual plant,  
with explanation. 
Explanations may include:
• 
Plant cannot produce glucose due to decrease in photosynthetic product 
(G3P). 
• 
Stunted growth due to lack of e
