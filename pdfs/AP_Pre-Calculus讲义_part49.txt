 term, a2 is called the second term, and in general, an is 
called the nth term. 
 
2.1.1 Arithmetic Sequences 
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of the form 
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ... 
The number a is the first term, and d is the common difference of the sequence. The 
nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by 
an = a + (n − 1)d 
 
Example 1 
Find the common difference, the first six terms, the nth term, and the 300th term of the 
arithmetic sequence 
13, 7, 1, −5, . . . 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 2 
 
66 
The 11th term of an arithmetic sequence is 52, and the 19th term is 92. Find the 1000th 
term. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2 Geometric Sequences 
A geometric sequence is a sequence of the form 
 
The number a is the first term, and r is the common ratio of the sequence. The nth term 
of an arithmetic sequence is given by 
 
 
Example 3 
Find the common ratio, the first term, the nth term, and the 8th term of the geometric 
sequence 
5, 15, 45, 135, . . .
