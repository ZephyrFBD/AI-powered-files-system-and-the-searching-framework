Section Summary
The cytoskeleton has three different types of protein elements. From narrowest to widest, they are the microfilaments
(actin filaments), intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Microfilaments are often associated with myosin. They provide
rigidity and shape to the cell and facilitate cellular movements. Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the nucleus
and other organelles in place. Microtubules help the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for motor proteins that move
vesicles through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. They are also the structural
element of
