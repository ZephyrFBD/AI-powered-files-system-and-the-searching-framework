complex. In general, the structure of the substrate—specifically its shape and charge—must be compatible with the
active site of the enzyme in order for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction to occur. Let’s take a look:
Once the reaction has occurred and the product is formed, the enzyme is released from the complex and restored to
its original state. Now the enzyme is free to react again with another bunch of substrates.
By binding and releasing substrates over and over again, the enzyme speeds the reaction along, enabling the cell to
release much-needed energy from various molecules. Here is a quick review on the function of enzymes.
Enzymes Do:
increase the rate of a reaction by lowering the reaction’s activation energy
form temporary enzyme-substrate complexes
remain unaffected by the reaction
Enzymes Don’t:
change the reaction
make reactions occur that would otherwise not occur at all
Induced-fit
However, scientists have discovered that enzymes and substrates don’t fit together quite s
