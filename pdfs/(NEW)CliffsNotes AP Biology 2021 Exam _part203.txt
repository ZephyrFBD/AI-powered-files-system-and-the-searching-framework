hat disrupts the normal activity of GCPRs of intestinal cells. In particular, the GTP attached to the G protein
cannot be converted back to a GDP, so the protein cannot be
deactivated. In these cells, this G protein regulates the concentration of Cl−,
 
and when locked in its active state, continuously generates cAMP. In
 
response, Cl−is continuously transported out of the cell. Water follows the Cl−by osmosis into the lumen of the
intestines. If not treated, the resulting
 
diarrhea can lead to dehydration and death, and the severe diarrhea assists the bacteria in returning to the water
supply.
Cancer is the result of uncontrolled cell division. Normally, cell division is highly regulated, with multiple
checkpoints during a cell cycle to insure that the process is progressing correctly. Some cells initiate cell division in
response to growth factors, proteins released by cells to stimulate other cells to divide. Growth factors activate a
protein kinase receptor, which, in turn, activ
