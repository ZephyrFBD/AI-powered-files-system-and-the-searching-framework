ossing-over is a
source of genetic variation, it can be a source of speciation; therefore, eliminate (D). Choice (A) is the only
correct answer.
47. C
Electrons passed down along the electron transport chain from one carrier to another lose energy and provide
energy for making ATP. Glucose is decomposed during glycolysis, but this process is not associated with
energy given up by electrons; eliminate (A). Glucose is made during photosynthesis, so eliminate (B). NADH
is an energy-rich molecule, which accepts electrons during the Krebs cycle. Therefore, (D) is incorrect as well.
48. A
The oxygen released during the light reaction comes from splitting water. (Review the reaction for
photosynthesis.) Therefore, water must have originally contained the radioactive oxygen. Carbon dioxide is
involved in the dark reaction and produces glucose, so eliminate (B). Glucose is the final product and would
not be radioactive unless carbon dioxide was the radioactive material, so (C) is incorrect. Fin
