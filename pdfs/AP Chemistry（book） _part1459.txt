 the wave function approaches zero only at a long 
distance from the nucleus. It therefore has no nodes, as we saw in 
Figure 6.22.
In the graph for the 2pz orbital in Figure 9.38, the wave func-
tion changes sign when it passes through z = 0. Notice that the two 
halves of the wave have the same shape except that one has positive 
(red) values and the other negative (blue) values. Analogously to 
the sine function, the wave function changes phase when it passes 
through the origin. Mathematically, the 2pz wave function is equal to 
zero whenever z = 0. This corresponds to any point on the xy plane, 
so we say that the xy plane is a nodal plane of the 2pz orbital. The wave 
function for a p orbital is much like a sine function because it has two 
equal parts that have opposite phases. Figure 9.38 gives a typical rep-
resentation used by chemists of the wave function for a pz orbital.* 
The red and blue lobes indicate the different phases of the orbital.
