ck
hypothesis is true, one could extrapolate the age of divergence of two
organisms by counting the number of genetic diï¬€erences in their
genomes. This latter hypothesis assumes that mutation rates are
constant over time and between species; a likely incorrect pair of
assumptions.
Populations and species continue to evolve today. Modern-day evolution
can be seen in recent emergent diseases (those that appear for the first
time or increase in incidence). Examples include severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, and Ebola. Scientific evidence of
chemical resistance also supports the claim that evolution continues to
occur. Bedbugs today have evolved resistance to pesticides by
developing thicker, waxier exoskeletons to protect them from toxins.
Additionally, arising from a hybrid between the European house mouse
and the Algerian mouse, which was introduced via human travel, the
common house mouse can now survive rodenticides. Evolution in action
can also be observed in a
