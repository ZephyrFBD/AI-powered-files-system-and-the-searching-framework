eriments in the field to test
the impact of Curvularia on the heat tolerance of this grass. They
grew plants with and without Curvularia in soils of different
temperatures. After 3 weeks, they measured plant mass and the
number of new shoots produced. (Endophytes are fungi that live
inside a plant body part without harming the plant. Parasites harm
the plant they live with.)

Which of the following best describes the role of Curvularia in this
study and the reason for that role?
Curvularia is an endophyte because plants with Curvularia
grew better than those without it, except at high temperatures.
Curvularia is an endophyte because plants with Curvularia
grew better than those without it, especially at high
temperatures.
Curvularia is a parasite because plants with Curvularia did not
grow as well as those without it, except at high temperatures.
Curvularia is a parasite because plants wi
