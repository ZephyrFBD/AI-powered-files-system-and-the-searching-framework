The diagram shows the left kidney. Why do the capillaries
carrying blood from the renal artery run over the top of the
renal pyramids?
a.
The capillaries deliver blood to the glomerulus
and run parallel to the proximal convoluted
tubule. Both are located in the medulla.
b.
The capillaries deliver blood to the glomerulus
and run perpendicular to the proximal
convoluted tubule. Both are located in the
cortex.
c.
The capillaries deliver blood to the glomerulus
and run perpendicular to the distal convoluted
tubule. Both are located in the cortex.
d.
The capillaries deliver blood to
