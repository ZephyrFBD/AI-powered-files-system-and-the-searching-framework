Correspondence Principle
We should note that Bohr made some radical assumptions that were at variance
with classical ideas. He assumed that electrons in fixed orbits do not radiate light
even though they are accelerating (moving in a circle), and he assumed that
angular momentum is quantized. Furthermore, he was not able to say how an
electron moved when it made a transition from one energy level to another. On
the other hand, there is no real reason to expect that in the tiny world of the atom
