Provide reasoning to justify the claim that the change in the amino acid 
sequence in the modified RNA polymerase affected the shape of the active site 
on the enzyme.
•	A change to the active site would explain the decrease in the  elongation rate.

(A)
Describe the effect of an increase in environmental temperature above the 
optimum temperature range of the enzyme.
Accept one of the following:
•	An increase in temperature (above the optimum range) will denature the 
enzyme and reduce the reaction rate.
•	An increase in temperature (above the optimum range) can alter the shape of 
the enzyme/active site and reduce the reaction rate.
