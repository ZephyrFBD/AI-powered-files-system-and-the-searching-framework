 called crossing
over. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = chiasma) (Figure 11.2).
In species such as humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not homologous (most of their genes differ), they
have a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal
complex develops only between the regions of homology.
Figure 11.2 Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are
bound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin
proteins at the centromere.
Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules. These
assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover—or genetic
recombination—between the non-sister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the
