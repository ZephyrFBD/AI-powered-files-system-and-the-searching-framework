of ecological succession in which no previous organisms have existed is called primary succession.
How does a new habitat full of bare rocks eventually turn into a forest? The first stage of the job usually falls to a
community of lichens. Lichens are hardy organisms. They can invade an area, land on bare rocks, and erode the rock
surface, over time turning it into soil. Lichens are considered pioneer organisms.
Once lichens have made an area more habitable, they’ve set the stage for other organisms to settle in. Communities
establish themselves in an orderly fashion. Lichens are replaced by mosses and ferns, which in turn are replaced by
tough grasses, then low shrubs, then evergreen trees, and, finally, deciduous trees. Why are lichens replaced?
Because they can’t compete with the new plants for sunlight and minerals.
The entire sequence is called a sere. The final community is called the climax community. The climax community
is the most stable. In our example, deciduous trees are p
