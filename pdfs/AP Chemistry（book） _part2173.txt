e rates: 
concentration, physical states of reactants, 
temperature, and presence of catalysts.
 14.2 ▶ Reaction Rates Learn the difference 
between average and instantaneous reaction 
rates, and use reaction stoichiometry to 
determine the relative rates of reactant 
disappearance and product appearance.
 14.3 ▶ Concentration and Rate Laws  
Learn how to determine rate laws, 
expressions that quantitatively express 
reaction rates in terms of reactant 
concentrations and experimentally 
determined rate constants.
 14.4 ▶ The Change of Concentration 
with Time Learn that rate equations can 
be written to express how concentrations 
change with time and look at several 
classifications of rate equations: zero-order, 
first-order, and second-order reactions.
 14.5 ▶ Temperature and Rate Explore the 
effect of temperature on rate. In order to 
occur, most reactions require a minimum 
input of energy called the activation energy.
 14.6 ▶ Reaction Mechanisms Understand 
how rate laws are de
