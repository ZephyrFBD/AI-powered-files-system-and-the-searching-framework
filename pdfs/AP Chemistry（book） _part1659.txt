h at the same temperature. The pressure in flask A is x atm, 
and the mass of gas in the flask is 1.2 g. The pressure in flask B is 
0.5x atm, and the mass of gas in that flask is 1.2 g. Which flask 
contains the gas of molar mass 30, and which contains the 
gas of molar mass 60?
 10.32  Suppose you are given two flasks at the same temperature, 
one of volume 2 L and the other of volume 3 L. The 2-L flask 
contains 4.8 g of gas, and the gas pressure is x atm. The 3-L 
flask contains 0.36 g of gas, and the gas pressure is 0.1x. Do 
the two gases have the same molar mass? If not, which con-
tains the gas of higher molar mass?
