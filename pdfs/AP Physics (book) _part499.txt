s the
weight of the object on Earth, which we have been writing as mg. Thus,
We can solve this for g, the acceleration of gravity at the Earth’s surface:
(5;5)
Thus, the acceleration of gravity at the surface of the Earth, g, is determined by
and 
(Don’t confuse G with g; they are very different quantities, but are
related by Eq. 5–5.)
Until G was measured, the mass of the Earth was not known. But once G
was measured, Eq. 5–5 could be used to calculate the Earth’s mass, and Caven-
dish was the first to do so. Since  
and the radius of the Earth is
then, from Eq. 5–5, we obtain the mass of the Earth to be
Equation 5–5 can be applied to other planets, where g, m, and r would refer 
to that planet.
