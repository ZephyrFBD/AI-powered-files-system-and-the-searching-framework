ow many picometers are there in 1 m? (b) Express 
6.0 * 103 m using a prefix to replace the power of ten.  
(c) Use exponential notation to express 4.22 mg in grams.  
(d) Use decimal notation to express 4.22 mg in grams.
SOLUTION
We can find the prefix related to each power of ten in Table 1.4:  
(a) nanogram, ng; (b) microsecond, ms; (c) millimeter, mm.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following weights would you expect to be  
suitable for weighing on an ordinary bathroom scale?  
*Mass and weight are not the same. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter; weight is the 
force exerted on this mass by gravity. For example, an astronaut weighs less on the Moon than 
on Earth because the Moon’s gravitational force is less than Earth’s. The astronaut’s mass on the 
Moon, however, is the same as it is on Earth.
Temperature
Temperature, a measure of the hotness or coldness of an object, is a physical property that 
determines the direction of heat flow. Heat always flows spontaneously
