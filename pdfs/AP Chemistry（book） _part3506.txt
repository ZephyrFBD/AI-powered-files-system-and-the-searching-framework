ossil fuels. In order 
to develop a hydrogen economy, it would be necessary to generate 
elemental hydrogen on a large scale and arrange for its transport and 
storage. These matters provide signiﬁcant technical challenges.
Figure 22.4 illustrates various sources and uses of H2 fuel. The gen-
eration of H2 through electrolysis of water is in principle the cleanest 
route, because this process—the reverse of Equation 22.11—produces 
only hydrogen and oxygen. 
 (Figure 1.7 and Section 20.9) How-
ever, the energy required to electrolyze water must come from some-
where. If we burn fossil fuels to generate this energy, we have not 
advanced very far toward a true hydrogen economy. If the energy for 
electrolysis came instead from a hydroelectric or nuclear power plant, 
solar cells, or wind generators, consumption of nonrenewable energy 
sources and undesired production of CO2 could be avoided.
The storage of hydrogen is another technical obstacle that must 
be overcome in developing a hyd
