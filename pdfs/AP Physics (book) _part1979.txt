e convenient for some applications is a thermistor (Fig. 18–15),
which consists of a metal oxide or semiconductor whose resistance also varies in
a repeatable way with temperature. Thermistors can be made quite small and
respond very quickly to temperature changes.

EXERCISE G The resistance of the tungsten filament of a common incandescent light-
bulb is how many times greater at its operating temperature of 2800 K than its resistance
at room temperature? (a) Less than 1% greater; (b) roughly 10% greater; (c) about 
2 times greater; (d) roughly 10 times greater; (e) more than 100 times greater.
The value of

tant to check the temperature range of valid
