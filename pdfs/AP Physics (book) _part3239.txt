FIGURE 29–11 The 
and
dipoles attract each other.
(These dipoles may be part of, for
example, the nucleotide bases
cytosine and guanine in DNA
molecules. See Fig. 29–12.) The 
and 
charges typically have
magnitudes of a fraction of e.

FIGURE 29–12 (a) Model of part of
a DNA double helix. The red dots
represent hydrogen bonds between
the two strands. (b) “Close-up” view:
cytosine (C) and guanine (G)
molecules on separate strands of a
DNA double helix are held together
by the hydrogen bonds (red dots)
involving an 
on one molecule
attracted to an 
or 
of a
molecule on the adjacent chain. See
also Section 16–10 and Figs. 16–39
