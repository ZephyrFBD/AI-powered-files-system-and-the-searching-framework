aturation, and
intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors
through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which encompass monocytes (the
precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. The majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes (red blood cells). Lymph is
a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes. Cells of the
immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial
space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue).
The cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Cytokines stimulate these
