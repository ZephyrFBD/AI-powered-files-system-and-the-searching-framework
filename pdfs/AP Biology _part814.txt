e testing the effect of various light
intensities on the growth of plants, you must place a heat sink
between the light and the plant. Without something to absorb the
heat from the light source, temperature would become a second
variable.
Have a large enough sample to draw a reasonable conclusion. A
sample of one organism is not acceptable. In Lab #1, “Artificial
Selection,” the sample size is 150.
Experimental organisms must be as similar as possible. They
must all be of the same variety, size, and/or mass, whichever is
appropriate. You must state that fact.
State that the experiment must be repeated. This reduces the
possibility that an error occurred by chance, some random factor,
or individual variations in the experimental organism.
LAB #1: ARTIFICIAL SELECTION
Introduction
In the classroom, students have few opportunities to study and measure
natural selection in living multicellular organisms. Many labs use
computer simulations instead. However, this lab is a good alternative fo
