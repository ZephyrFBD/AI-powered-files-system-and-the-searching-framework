Plant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either DNA or RNA. You have already learned about one of these,
the tobacco mosaic virus. As plant cells have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated
endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. For many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant,
damage to some of the plants’ cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host. This damage is often caused by
weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Additionally, plant offspring may inherit

viral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected
plant’s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. When plants viruses are transferred
between different plants, this is know
