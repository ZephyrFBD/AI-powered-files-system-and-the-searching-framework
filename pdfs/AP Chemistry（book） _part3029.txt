tion of molecu-
lar speeds presented in Figure 10.13(a). An increase in temperature increases the most 
probable speed of the molecules and also broadens the distribution of speeds. Hence, 
the molecules have a greater number of possible kinetic energies, and the number 
of microstates increases. Thus, the entropy of the system increases with increasing 
temperature.
Molecular Motions and Energy
When a substance is heated, the motion of its molecules increases. In Section 10.7, 
we found that the average kinetic energy of the molecules of an ideal gas is directly 
proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. That means the higher the 
temperature, the faster the molecules move and the more kinetic energy they pos-
sess. Moreover, hotter systems have a broader distribution of molecular speeds, as 
 
Figure 10.12(a) shows.
The particles of an ideal gas are idealized points with no volume and no bonds, 
howeverâ€”points that we visualize as flitting around through space. Any real mo
