Test Crosses
Suppose that you wanted to know the genotype of a dwarf pea plant. That would easily be identified as tt because
dwarf-stemmed plants must have two copies of the recessive allele. Suppose, however, you wanted to know the
genotype of a plant with the dominant trait, tall stems. Would it be TT or Tt ? To determine which genotype is
correct, you would perform a test cross. A test cross is a mating of an individual whose genotype you are trying to
determine with an individual whose genotype is known. You will always know the genotype of the individual that
expresses the recessive trait (dwarf stems). So the cross is T ___ × tt. Since you do not know the second allele for the
first individual, represent it with an underscore, leaving a blank space for the unknown allele. The next step is to
perform both
possible crosses, TT × tt and Tt × tt. For the first cross, all F1will be tall
( Tt). For the second cross, ½ will be tall (Tt) and ½ will be dwarf (tt). A farmer wou
