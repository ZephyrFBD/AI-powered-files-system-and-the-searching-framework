ic properties. They are usually brittle sub-
stances with high melting points. They are usually crystalline. Furthermore, ionic crystals 
often can be cleaved; that is, they break apart along smooth, flat surfaces. These charac-
teristics result from electrostatic forces that maintain the ions in a rigid, well-defined, 
three-dimensional arrangement such as that shown in Figure 8.4.
Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation
The formation of sodium chloride from sodium and chlorine is very exothermic, as indicated 
by the large negative enthalpy of formation value given in Equation 8.1, ∆Hf° = -410.9 kJ. 
Appendix C shows that the heat of formation of other ionic substances is also quite negative. 
What factors make the formation of ionic compounds so exothermic?
In Equation 8.2, we represented the formation of NaCl as the transfer of an electron 
from Na to Cl. Recall from Section 7.4 that the loss of electrons from an atom is always 
an endothermic process. Removing an electron from Na(g) to
