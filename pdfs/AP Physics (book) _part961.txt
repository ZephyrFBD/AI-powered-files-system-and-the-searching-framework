ess. Not only
is there a force pulling down on the rod at its lower end, but since the rod is in
equilibrium we know that the support at the top is exerting an equal† upward
force on the rod at its upper end, Fig.9–20a. In fact, this tensile stress exists through-
out the material. Consider, for example, the lower half of a suspended rod as shown
in Fig. 9–20b. This lower half is in equilibrium, so there must be an upward force
on it to balance the downward force at its lower end. What exerts this upward
force? It must be the upper part of the rod. Thus we see that external forces
applied to an object give rise to internal forces, or stress, within the material itself.
Strain or deformation due to tensile stress is but one type of stress to which
materials can be subjected. There are two other common types of stress: compres-
sive and shear. Compressive stress is the exact opposite of tensile stress. Instead of
being stretched, the material is compressed: the forces act inwardly on the
