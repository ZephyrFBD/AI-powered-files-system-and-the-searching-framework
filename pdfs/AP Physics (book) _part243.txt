FIGURE 3;4 If the vectors are
added in reverse order, the resultant
is the same. (Compare to Fig. 3–3.)
The tail-to-tip method of adding vectors can be extended to three or more
vectors. The resultant is drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last
one added. An example is shown in Fig. 3–5; the three vectors could represent
displacements (northeast, south, west) or perhaps three forces. Check for yourself
that you get the same resultant no matter in which order you add the three vectors.
