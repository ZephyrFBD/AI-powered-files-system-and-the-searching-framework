s other cells of
the stomach to produce gastric juices.
2. Secretin is produced by the cells lining the duodenum when food enters. Secretin stimulates the pancreas to
produce bicarbonate, which, when deposited into the small intestine, neutralizes the acidity of the chyme.
3. Cholecystokinin is produced by the small intestine in response to the presence of fats. Cholecystokinin stimulates
the gallbladder to release bile and the pancreas to release its enzymes.
The Muscular System
A skeletal muscle consists of numerous muscle cells called muscle fibers. Muscle fibers have special terminology
and distinguishing characteristics, as follows:
1. The sarcolemma, or plasma membrane of the muscle cell, is highly invaginated by transverse tubules (or T
tubules) that permeate the cell.
2. The sarcoplasm, or cytoplasm of the muscle cell, contains the calcium-storing sarcoplasmic reticulum, the
specialized endoplasmic reticulum of a muscle cell.
3. Skeletal muscle cells are multinucleate. The nucl
