field even though the sheet is not ferromagnetic and
does not touch the pole faces. Explain.
18. A bar magnet is held above the floor and dropped
(Fig. 21–51). In case (a), the
magnet falls through a wire
loop. In case (b), there 
is nothing between the
magnet and the floor. How
will the speeds of the mag-
nets compare? Explain.

19. A metal bar, pivoted at one end, oscillates freely in the
absence of a magnetic field; but in a magnetic field, its oscil-
lations are quickly damped out. Explain. (This magnetic
damping is used in a number of practical devices.)
20. An enclosed transformer has four wire leads coming from
it. How could you determine the ratio of turns on the two
coils without taking the transformer apart? How would you
know which wires paired with which?
21. The use of higher-voltage lines in homes—say, 600 V or
1200 V—would reduce energy waste. Why are they not used?
