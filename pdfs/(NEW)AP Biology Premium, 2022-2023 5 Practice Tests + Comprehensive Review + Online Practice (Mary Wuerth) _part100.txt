with a lower GC content.
(b) On the axes provided, construct an appropriately labeled graph of the mean percent of GC content in each
speciesâ€™s genome. Include 95% confidence intervals.
(c) Do the data support the claim that plants in colder climates have a higher GC content in their genomes?
Use the data provided to support your answer.
(d) A plant species has a genome with a GC content of 43.4%. Predict whether that plant is more likely to be
native to an area with cold winters or an area with warmer winters. Justify your prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (D) RNA contains ribose and uracil. Choice (A) is incorrect because deoxyribose and thymine are found in
DNA, not RNA. Deoxyribose is found in DNA, not RNA, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect
because thymine is not found in RNA; it is found in DNA.
2. (B) Nucleic acids contain phosphorus but not sulfur. So if phosphorus entered the cell but sulfur did not, a
nucleic acid was most likely injected. Ch
