Light touch is detected by Pacini corpuscles.

Merkel’s disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips.
Meissner’s corpuscles, (shown in Figure 27.6) also known as tactile corpuscles, are found in the upper dermis, but they
project into the epidermis. They, too, are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids. They respond to
fine touch and pressure, but they also respond to low-frequency vibration or flutter. They are rapidly adapting, fluid-filled,
encapsulated neurons with small, well-defined borders and are responsive to fine details. Like Merkel’s disks, Meissner’s
corpuscles are not as plentiful in the palms as they are in the fingertips.
Figure 27.6 Meissner corpuscles in the fingertips, such as the one viewed here using bright field light microscopy,
allow for touch discrimination of fine detail. (credit: modification of work by "Wbensmith"/Wikimedia Commons; scale-
