icantly degraded by a small amount of corrosion on a battery
terminal. Figure 19–91a depicts a properly functioning 
circuit with a battery (12.5-V emf,
internal resistance)
attached via corrosion-free cables to a starter motor of 
resistance 
Sometime later, corrosion between 
a battery terminal and a starter cable introduces an extra
series resistance of only

circuit as suggested in
Fig. 19–91b. Let
