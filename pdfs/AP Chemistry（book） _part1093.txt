Give It Some Thought
Which would you expect to be greater, I1 for a boron atom or I2 for a carbon atom?
7.4 ∣ Ionization Energy
The ease with which electrons can be removed from an atom or ion has a major impact on 
chemical behavior. The ionization energy of an atom or ion is the minimum energy 
required to remove an electron from the ground state of the isolated gaseous atom or ion. 
We first encountered ionization in our discussion of the Bohr model of the hydrogen 
atom. 
 (Section 6.3) If the electron in an H atom is excited from n = 1 (the ground 
state) to n = ∞, the electron is completely removed from the atom; the atom is ionized.
In general, the first ionization energy, I1, is the energy needed to rem
