lysis is the breakdown of a compound by adding water. It is the
reverse of condensation synthesis.
sucrose + water → glucose + fructose
Polysaccharides are macromolecules. They are polymers of
carbohydrates, and are formed as many monosaccharides join together by
dehydration reactions. There are four important polysaccharides, as shown
in Table 2.2.
Table 2.2
Structural and Storage Polysaccharides
 
Structural
Storage of Energy
Found
in
plants:
Cellulose
Starch
 
Makes up plant cell walls
Two forms are amylose and
amylopectin
Found
in
animals:
Chitin
Glycogen
 
Makes up the exoskeleton in
arthropods (and cell walls in
mushrooms)
“Animal starch.” In humans,
this is stored in liver and
skeletal muscle
Lipids
Lipids are a diverse class of organic compounds that include fats, oils,
waxes, and steroids. They are grouped together because they are all
hydrophobic, meaning that they are not soluble in water. Structurally, most
lipids consist of 1 glycerol and 3 fatty acids; see Figure 2.6.
