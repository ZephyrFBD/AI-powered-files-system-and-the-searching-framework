of this lens?
12. (II) A person struggles to read by holding a book at arm’s
length, a distance of 52 cm away. What power of reading
glasses should be prescribed for her, assuming they will be
placed 2.0 cm from the eye and she wants to read at the
“normal” near point of 25 cm?
13. (II) Reading glasses of what power are needed for a person
whose near point is 125 cm, so that he can read a computer
screen at 55 cm? Assume a lens–eye distance of 1.8 cm.
14. (II) An eye is corrected by a
lens, 2.0 cm from the
eye. (a) Is this eye near- or farsighted? (b) What is this
eye’s far point without glasses?
15. (II) A person’s right eye can see objects clearly only if they

contact lens is required so that objects far away are sharp?
(b) What will be the near point with the lens in place?
16. (II) About how much longer is the nearsighted eye in
Example 25–6 than the 2.0 cm of a normal eye?
