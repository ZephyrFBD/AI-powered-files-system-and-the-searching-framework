action. 
 (Section 16.11) Because the ligands have available pairs of electrons, they can 
function as Lewis bases (electron-pair donors). Metal ions (particularly transition-metal 
ions) have empty valence orbitals, so they can act as Lewis acids (electron-pair acceptors). 
We can picture the bond between the metal ion and ligand as the result of their sharing a 
pair of electrons initially on the ligand:

The formation of metalâ€“ligand bonds can markedly alter the properties we observe 
for the metal ion. A metal complex is a distinct chemical species that has physical and 
chemical properties different from those of the metal ion and ligands from which it is 
formed. As one example, Figure 23.9 shows the color change that occurs when aqueous 
solutions of NCS- (colorless) and Fe3+ (yellow) are mixed, forming 3Fe(H2O)5NCS42+.
Complex formation can also significantly change other properties of metal ions, 
such as their
