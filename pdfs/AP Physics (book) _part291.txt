A quantity such as velocity, that has both a magnitude and a
direction, is called a vector. A quantity such as mass, that has
only a magnitude, is called a scalar. On diagrams, vectors are
represented by arrows.
Addition of vectors can be done graphically by placing the
tail of each successive arrow at the tip of the previous one. The
sum, or resultant vector, is the arrow drawn from the tail of the
first vector to the tip of the last vector. Two vectors can also be
added
