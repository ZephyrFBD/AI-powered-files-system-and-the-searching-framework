phase. The chromosomes now begin to line up along the equatorial plane, or the
metaphase plate, of the cell. This happens because spindle fibers are attached to the kinetochore of each chromatid.
Stage 3: Anaphase: Apart (chromatids are pulled apart)
During anaphase, sister chromatids of each chromosome separate at the centromere and migrate to opposite poles.
Chromatids are pulled apart by the microtubules, which begin to shorten. Each half of a pair of sister chromatids
now moves to opposite poles of the cell. Non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the cell.
Stage 4: Telophase: Two (the cell completes splitting in two)
The final phase of mitosis is telophase. A nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes and the nucleoli
reappear.
The nuclear membrane is ready to divide. Now it’s time to split the cytoplasm in a process known as cytokinesis.
Look at the figure below and you’ll notice that the cell has begun to split along a cleavage furrow (which is
produced by actin microfi
