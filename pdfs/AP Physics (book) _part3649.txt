cay would violate lepton number; all of
its decay products must be leptons.
(d) No, its decay products must include a tau neutrino but
could include hadrons such as pions.
(e) No, the tau lepton is too massive to decay.
5. Many particle accelerators are circular because:
(a) particles accelerate faster around circles.
(b) in order to move in a circle, acceleration is required.
(c) a circular accelerator has a shorter length than a
square one.
(d) the particles can be accelerated through the same
potential difference many times, making the
accelerator more compact.
(e) a particle moving in a circle needs more energy than a
particle moving in a straight line.
6. Which of the following are today considered fundamental
particles (that is, not composed of smaller components)?
Choose as many as apply.
(a) Atoms. (b) Electrons. (c) Protons. (d) Neutrons.
(e) Quarks. (f) Photon. (g) Higgs boson.
7. The electronâ€™s antiparticle is called the positron. Which of
the following properties, if any, a
