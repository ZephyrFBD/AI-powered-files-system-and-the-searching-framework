the relative num-
bers of ions and neutral molecules. This balance produces a state of chemical equilib-
rium in which the relative numbers of each type of ion or molecule in the reaction are 
constant over time. Chemists use half-arrows pointing in opposite directions to represent 
reactions that go both forward and backward to achieve equilibrium, such as the ioniza-
tion of weak electrolytes. In contrast, a single reaction arrow is used for reactions that 
largely go forward, such as the ionization of strong electrolytes. Because HCl is a strong 
electrolyte, we write the equation for the ionization of HCl as
 
HCl1aq2 ¡ H+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 
[4.2]
The absence of a left-pointing half-arrow indicates that the H + and Cl - ions have no ten-
dency to recombine to form HCl molecules.
In the following sections, we will look at how a compound’s composition lets us pre-
dict whether it is a strong electrolyte, weak electrolyte, or nonelectrolyte. For the moment, 
you need only to remember that
