Inherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during meiosis. Chromosome disorders can be divided
into two categories: abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural rearrangements. Because even small
segments of chromosomes can span many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and often fatal.
Identification of Chromosomes
The isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method
by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans. A karyotype is the number and appearance of
chromosomes, and incl
