(body) cells and be responsible for the spontaneous development of
cancer, or they can occur during gametogenesis and affect future offspring.
Even though radiation and certain chemicals cause mutations, when and
where mutations occur is random.

There are two types of mutations: gene mutations and chromosome
mutations. Gene mutations are caused by a change in the DNA sequence.
Some human genetic disorders caused by gene and chromosome mutations
are listed and described further in Table 8.2. The nature of gene mutations
at the DNA level is discussed in the next chapter.

Certain human genetic diseases can be caused by the inheritance of a single gene or by
a chromosomal abnormality.
Although gene mutations cannot be seen under a microscope,
chromosome mutations can. A technique called a kary
