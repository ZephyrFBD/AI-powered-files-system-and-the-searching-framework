other species diverge
and become one or more new species, and that still other species become extinct. The question that evolutionary
biologists try to answer is how evolution occurs. For this they propose theories. Lamarck theorized, incorrectly, that
evolution occurs through the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwinâ€™s theory was that evolution progresses
through natural selection. These theories, together with others discussed in this chapter, propose mechanisms
responsible for the evolutionary patterns unequivocally observed in nature.
Evidence for Evolution
Evidence for evolution is provided by the following five scientific disciplines:
1. Paleontology provides fossils that reveal the prehistoric existence of extinct species. As a result, changes in
species and the formation of new species can be studied.
Fossil deposits are often found among sediment layers, where the deepest fossils represent the oldest specimens. For
example, fossil oysters removed from successive laye
