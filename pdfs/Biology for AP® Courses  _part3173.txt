ess (CUMS). In rats CUMS can be induced by
environmental factors such as electric shock,
immobilization, or isolation (Qiao et al., Neural Plasticity,
2016).
C. Pose two scientific questions that can be investigated
to connect the dynamic homeostasis and survival
advantage of the individual to dendritic plasticity.
An alternative explanation of the manner in which the
brain integrates new information is through synaptic
plasticity. This has been demonstrated by Nabavi and co-
workers (Nature, 511, 2014). An associated memory was
created in a rat by pairing two stimuli: an audio tone and a
foot shock. The animal had previously been trained to
avoid pressing a lever that delivers a reward by associating
the lever press with a shock. After conditioning the animal
responded to the tone as if it was a shock and avoided
