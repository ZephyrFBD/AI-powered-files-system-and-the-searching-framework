 to accumulate
biomass and increase in height until the flow rate of water
through the xylem (plant vascular tissue that transports
water and minerals from roots to shoots) is no longer
sufficient to support the negative water potential at the
interface between root and soil. Fluid dynamic models
predict that increasing the diameter, d, of the xylem greatly
increases the rate of flow of water, leading to greater
productivity when water is abundant. Under conditions of
drought stress, the water potential is reduced, and an air
bubble can disrupt the flow of water in that vessel entirely.
A larger stem diameter permits a larger number of small
vessels.
C. Describe a model of the evolution of xylem in trees in
terms of selection under conditions of unlimited and
limited water resources.
Olson and Rosell (New Phytologist, 197, 2013)
investigated the question of whether xylem diameter was
determined by water availability or by plant height and,
consequently, stem diameter. A summary of thei
