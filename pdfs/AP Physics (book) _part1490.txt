r does 
change?
50. (II) Show that the rms speed of molecules in a gas is given
by
where P is the pressure in the gas and
is the gas density.
51. (II) Show that for a mixture of two gases at the same tem-
perature, the ratio of their rms speeds is equal to the inverse
ratio of the square roots of their molecular masses,
52. (II) What is the rms speed of nitrogen molecules contained
in an 
volume at 2.9 atm if the total amount of 
nitrogen is 2100 mol?
53. (II) Two isotopes of uranium,
and 
(the superscripts
refer to their atomic masses), can be separated by a gas
diffusion process by combining them with fluorine to make
the gaseous compound 
Calculate the ratio of the rms
speeds of these molecules for the two isotopes, at constant T.
Use Appendix B for masses.
54. (III) Calculate (a) the rms speed of an oxygen molecule at
0Â°C and (b) determine how many times per second it would
move back and forth across a 5.0-m-long room on average,
assuming it made no collisions with other molecules.
