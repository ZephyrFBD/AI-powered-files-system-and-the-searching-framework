f what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. This hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was
a radical explanation based on a sharp spike in the levels of iridium (which rains down from space in meteors at a fairly
constant rate but is otherwise absent on Earth’s surface) at the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous
and Paleogene periods (Figure 38.6). This boundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many
other taxa. The researchers who discovered the iridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the
atmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather than a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period. It was
a radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately aged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more
believable. Now an abundance of geological evidence supports the theory. Recovery times for biodiversity after the end-
Cretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for
