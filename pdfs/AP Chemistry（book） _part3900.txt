t it would be soluble in polar organic solvents, 
especially ones that contain oxygen. In fact, pyruvic acid dis-
solves in water, ethanol, and diethyl ether.
(d) The methyl group carbon has sp3 hybridization. The carbon of 
the carbonyl group has sp2 hybridization because of the double 
bond to oxygen. Similarly, the carboxylic acid carbon is sp2 
hybridized.
(e) The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is
CH3CCOOH
2 (H)
+
O
CH3CCOOH

Essentially, the ketonic functional group has been reduced to an 
alcohol.

As an epilogue, we offer the ultimate study strategy in the form 
of a question: What do you plan to do with the knowledge of chem-
istry that you have gained thus far in your studies? Many of you will 
enroll in additional courses in chemistry as part of your required cur-
riculum. For others, this will
