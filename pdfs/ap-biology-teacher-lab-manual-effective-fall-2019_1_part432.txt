Figure 2a-b. MPF Production During the Cell Cycle 
As shown in Figure 3, different CDKs are produced during the phases. The cyclins 
determine which processes in cell division are turned on or off and in what order by 
CDK. As each cyclin is turned on or off, CDK causes the cell to progress through the 
stages in the cell cycle.

QU: What does green circle at upper left represent? Can it be omitted?
 
Cyclins and CDKs do not allow the cell to progress through its cycle automatically. 
There are three checkpoints a cell must pass through: the G1 checkpoint, G2 checkpoint, 
and the M-spindle checkpoint (Figure 4). At each of the checkpoints, the cell checks 
that it has completed all of the tasks
