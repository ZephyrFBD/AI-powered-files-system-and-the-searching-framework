Microbiologists typically grow prokaryotes in the laboratory using an appropriate culture medium containing all the
nutrients needed by the target organism. The medium can be liquid, broth, or solid. After an incubation time at the right

techniques for pure culture, including staining and using growth media. His assistant Julius Petri invented the Petri dish
whose use persists in today’s laboratories. Koch
