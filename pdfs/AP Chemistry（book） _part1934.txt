drums, and pipes, 
has an average molecular weight in the range of 106 amu and has a density of 0.94 g>cm3 or 
higher. This form has fewer side chains and thus a higher degree of crystallinity.

chain. This segment consists of 28 carbon 
atoms. In commercial polyethylenes, the 
chain lengths range from about 103 to 
105 CH2 units.
Ordered regions
▲ Figure 12.40 Interactions between 
polymer chains. In the circled regions, 
the forces that operate between adjacent 
segments of the chains lead to ordering 
analogous to the ordering in crystals, though 
less regular.
