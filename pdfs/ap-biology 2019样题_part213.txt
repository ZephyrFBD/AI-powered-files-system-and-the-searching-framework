mately 4.6 billion 
years ago (bya). The environment was 
too hostile for life until 3.9 bya, and the 
earliest fossil evidence for life dates to 
3.5 bya. Taken together, this evidence 
provides a plausible range of dates when 
the origin of life could have occurred.
b.	There are several models about the origin of 
life on Earth—
 i. Primitive Earth provided inorganic 
precursors from which organic 
molecules could have been synthesized 
because of the presence of available free 
energy and the absence of a significant 
quantity of atmospheric oxygen (O2).
ii. Organic molecules could have been 
transported to Earth by a meteorite or
other celestial event.
