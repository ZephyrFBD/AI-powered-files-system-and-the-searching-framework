lar environment has its own carrying capacity around
which the population size oscillates; see Figure 12.4.
Figure 12.4 Carrying Capacity of One Environment
In addition, the carrying capacity changes as the environmental
conditions change. Perhaps a fire destroyed several acres of forest habitat.
See Figure 12.5.

Limiting Factors
Limiting factors are those factors that limit population growth. They are
divided into two categories: density-dependent and density-independent
factors.
Density-dependent factors are those factors that increase directly
as the population density increases. They include competition for
food, the buildup of wastes, predation, and disease.
Density-independent factors are those factors whose occurrence is
unrelated to the population density. These include earthquakes,
storms, and naturally occurring fires and floods.
