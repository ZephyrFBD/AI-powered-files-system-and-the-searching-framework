F2, (c) MgO.
 12.66  The coordination number for the Al3+ ion is typically be-
tween four and six. Use the anion coordination number to 
determine the Al3 +  coordination number in the following 
compounds: (a) AlF3 where the fluoride ions are two coordi-
nate, (b) Al2O3 where the oxygen ions are six coordinate, (c) 
AlN where the nitride ions are four coordinate.
 12.67  Classify each of the following statements as true or false:
(a) Although both molecular solids and covalent-network 
solids have covalent bonds, the melting points of molec-
ular solids are much lower because their covalent bonds 
are much weaker.
(b) Other factors being equal, highly symmetric molecules 
tend to form solids with higher melting points than 
asymmetrically shaped molecules.
 12.68  Classify each of the following statements as true or false:
(a) For molecular solids, the melting point generally in-
creases as the strengths of the covalent bonds increase.
