with one strand of the DNA
molecule extending beyond the second strand. These jagged ends, or “sticky ends,” allow DNA fragments with
complimentary jagged ends to fit back together. This technique is important for inserting genes (DNA fragments)
into bacterial plasmids. When a plasmid and a foreign source of DNA (with a gene of interest) are treated with the
same restriction enzyme and mixed together, the sticky ends of the foreign DNA will match the sticky ends of the
plasmid DNA. The foreign DNA fragment can then be bonded to the plasmid DNA by treatment with DNA ligase.
The recombinant plasmid can then be used to introduce the foreign DNA into a cell.
Part II: DNA Mapping
When DNA is collected at a crime scene, its analysis requires that it be cut up into pieces and then separated. The
pieces are arranged by size to form a DNA chart or map. Because the DNA of every individual (except identical
twins) is different, the map of DNA pieces from the crime scene can be compared to other D
