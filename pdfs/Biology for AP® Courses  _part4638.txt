algae), and the apex consumer (Chinook salmon).
Ecologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems. Some transfers are easier or more
difficult to measure depending on the complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the
ecosystem. In other words, some ecosystems are more difficult to study than others, and sometimes the quantification of
energy transfers has to be estimated.
Another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency.
Net production efficiency (NPE) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level
incorporate the energy they receive into biomass; it is calculated using the following formula:
NPE =  net consumer productivity
assimilation
 Ã— 100
Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level. Assimilation is the
biomass (energy content generated per uni
