sol to the 
mitochondrion, where further oxidation occurs.
ENE-1.L.3
In the Krebs cycle, carbon dioxide is released 
from organic intermediates, ATP is synthesized 
from ADP and inorganic phosphate, and 
electrons are transferred to the coenzymes 
NADH and FADH2.
ENE-1.L.4
Electrons extracted in glycolysis and Krebs 
cycle reactions are transferred by NADH and 
FADH2 to the electron transport chain in the 
inner mitochondrial membrane.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.L.5
When electrons are transferred between 
molecules in a sequence of reactions as they 
pass through the ETC, an electrochemical 
gradient of protons (hydrogen ions) across the 
inner mitochondrial membrane is established.
ENE-1.L.6
Fermentation allows glycolysis to proceed in 
the absence of oxygen and produces organic 
molecules, includin
