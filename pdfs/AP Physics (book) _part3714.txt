as described in Fig. 33–15. The very distant galaxies
shown in the XDF photo at the start of this Chapter, page 947, are thought to be
visible only because of gravitational lensing (and magnification of their emitted
light) by nearer galaxies—as if the nearby galaxies acted as a magnifying glass.
The mathematician Fermat showed in the 1600s that optical phenomena,
including reflection, refraction, and effects of lenses, can be derived from a
simple principle: that light traveling between two points follows the shortest 
path in space. Thus if gravity curves the path of light, then gravity must be able to
curve space itself. That is, space itself can be curved, and it is gravitational mass
that causes the curvature. Indeed, the curvature of space—or rather, of four-
dimensional space-time—is a basic aspect of Einstein’s General Relativity.
What is meant by curved space? To understand, recall that our normal
method of viewing the world is via Euclidean plane geometry. In Euclidean
geomet
