itor (Section 17–9) can
be written as either 
or 
In the first case the
energy is proportional to C; in the second case the energy is
proportional to 1 C. (a) Explain how both of these equations
can be correct. (b) When might you use the first equation
and when might you use the second equation? (c) If a paper
dielectric is inserted into a parallel-plate capacitor that is
attached to a battery (V does not change), by what factor
will the energy stored in the capacitor change? (d) If a
quartz dielectric is inserted into a charged parallel-plate
capacitor that is isolated from any battery, by what factor will
the energy stored in the capacitor change?

5. Suppose it takes 75 kW of power for your car to travel at a
constant speed on the highway. (a) What is this in horse-
power? (b) How much energy in joules would it take for
your car to travel at highway speed for 5.0 hours? (c) Suppose
this amount of energy is to be stored in the electric field of a
