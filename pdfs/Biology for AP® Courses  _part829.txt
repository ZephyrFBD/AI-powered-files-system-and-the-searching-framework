trons, cytochrome c can accept
only one at a time).
Complex IV
The fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a3. This complex contains two heme groups (one in each
of the two cytochromes, a, and a3) and three copper ions (a pair of CuA and one CuB in cytochrome a3). The cytochromes
hold an oxygen molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced. The reduced
oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (H2O). The removal of the hydrogen
ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient used in the process of chemiosmosis.
Chemiosmosis
In chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons)
across the membrane. The uneven distribution of H+ ions across the membrane establishes both concentration and electrical
gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ionsâ€™ positive charge and their aggregation
