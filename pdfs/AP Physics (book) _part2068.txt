he switch closed, so the current leaving the battery
is reduced. Thus, bulb C will be dimmer when we open the switch, but bulb B 
will be brighter because it gets more current when the switch is open (you may
want to use some mathematics here).

lightbulb and its resistance.
EXERCISE C A 100-W, 120-V lightbulb and a 60-W, 120-V lightbulb are connected in
two different ways as shown in Fig. 19–9. In each case, which bulb glows more brightly?
Ignore change of filament resistance with current (and temperature).

Analyzing a circuit. A 9.0-V battery whose internal resis-
tance r is 
is connected in the circuit shown in Fig. 19–10a. (a) How much
current is drawn from the battery? (b) What is the terminal voltage of the battery?
