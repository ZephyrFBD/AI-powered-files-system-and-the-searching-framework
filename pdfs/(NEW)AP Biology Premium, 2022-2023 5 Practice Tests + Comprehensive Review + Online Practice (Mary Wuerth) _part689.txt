he upper surface of the leaves of Quercus alba because Passiflora incarnata
typically grows in more humid environments than does Quercus alba. If the environment surrounding a
plant is more humid, the difference in water potential between the plant and its surroundings will be less,
and the plant will likely lose less water to its environment when it opens its stomata to take in the carbon
dioxide needed for photosynthesis. In drier environments, like the ones in which Quercus alba is typically
found, the difference in water potential between the plant and its environment is greater. When the plant
opens its stomata to take in the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis, it is more likely to lose water to
its environment.

(a) Plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis, and the oxygen produced by the Elodea during
photosynthesis would accumulate in the inverted tubes.
(b) The independent variable is the temperature of the water baths. The dependent variable is the size of the
