CHAPTER 16
Electric Charge and Electric Field
Electric force using vector components. Calculate the
net electrostatic force on charge 
shown in Fig. 16–20a due to the charges 
and
APPROACH We use Coulomb’s law to find the magnitudes of the individual
forces. The direction of each force will be along the line connecting 
to 
or 
The forces 
and 
have the directions shown in Fig. 16–20a, since 
exerts an attractive force on 
and 
exerts a repulsive force. The forces 
and 
are not along the same line, so to find the resultant force on 
we resolve
and 
into x and
