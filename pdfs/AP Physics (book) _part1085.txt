 hot (engine running temperature). In other words, the viscosity does not 
drop precipitously as the oil warms up, as a simple 20-weight oil would.
The French scientist J. L. Poiseuille (1799–1869), who was interested in the
physics of blood circulation (and after whom the “poise”is named), determined how
the variables affect the flow rate of an incompressible fluid undergoing laminar
flow in a cylindrical tube. His result, known as Poiseuille’s equation, is:
(10;9)
where R is the inside radius of the tube,
is the tube length,
is the pressure
difference between the ends,
is the coefficient of viscosity, and Q is the volume
rate of flow (volume of fluid flowing past a given point per unit time which in SI
has units of 
). Equation 10–9 applies only to laminar (streamline) flow.
Poiseuille’s equation tells us that the flow rate Q is directly proportional to
the “pressure gradient,”
and it is inversely proportional to the viscos-
ity of the fluid. This is just what we might expect. It may
