ll membrane depends on two things: (1) the semipermeability of the plasma membrane and (2) the size and
charge of particles that want to get through.
Since the plasma membrane is composed primarily of phospholipids, small, lipid-soluble substances cross the
membrane without any resistance. Why? Because “like dissolves like.” The lipid bilayer is a hydrophobic sandwich
(hydrophilic outside and hydrophobic interior), and only hydrophobic things can pass that central zone. If a
substance is hydrophilic, the bilayer won’t let it pass without assistance, called facilitated transport.
Homeostasis
Moving things across membranes is important for growth and homeostasis.
Osmoregulation is the movement of water and solute across membranes to
maintain homeostasis.
Facilitated transport depends upon a number of proteins that act as tunnels through the membrane. Channels are very
specialized types of tunnels that let only certain things through.
The most famous of these are aquaporins, which are wat
