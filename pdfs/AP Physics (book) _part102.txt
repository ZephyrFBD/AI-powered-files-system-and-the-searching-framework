asure the thickness of the first 500 pages of this book (page 1 to page 500),
you might get something like 1.5 cm. Note that 500 numbered pages, counted
front and back, is 250 separate pieces of paper. So one sheet must have a
thickness of about
or less than a tenth of a millimeter (0.1 mm).

ESTIMATE
Height by triangulation. Estimate the height
of the building shown in Fig. 1–12, by “triangulation,” with the help of a bus-stop
pole and a friend.
APPROACH By standing your friend next to the pole, you estimate the height
of the pole to be 3 m. You next step away from the pole until the top of the
pole is in line with the top of the building, Fig. 1–12a. You are 5 ft 6 in. tall, so
your eyes are about 1.5 m above the ground. Your friend is taller, and when
she stretches out her arms, one hand touches you, and the other touches the
pole, so you estimate that distance as 2 m (Fig. 1–12a). You then pace off the
distance from the pol
