e of DNA. The enzyme DNA ligase is added to seal the strands together.
3. Cloning Vector—original plasmid that is used to carry foreign DNA into a cell and replicate there.
1. When the restriction enzyme is added to plasmid, lac Z is destroyed and nonfunctional. The lac Z gene
produces the enzyme β-galactosidase, which breaks down the sugar X-gal causing the colony to appear
blue. If the lac Z gene product is not made, the colony appears white; if the gene is functional, the
colony appears blue.
2. Ampicillin resistance gene allows bacteria to grow in the presence of the antibiotic ampicillin.
3. Media is selective for clones that have the ampicillin resistance gene and differential for blue or white
colonies.
4. Colony that is growing on plate (ampicillin resistance) and white are correct clones carrying
recombinant DNA.
B. DNA Gel Electrophoresis
1. DNA is placed in a gel made of a polysaccharide called agarose or acrylamide (used for smaller
fragments).
2. Migration of DNA is based
