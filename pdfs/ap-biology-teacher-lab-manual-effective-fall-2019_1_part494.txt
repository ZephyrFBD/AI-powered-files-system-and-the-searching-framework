 the corn genome. When expressed, the Bt gene 
produces a toxin that kills caterpillars and controls earworms that damage corn — but is 
the corn safe for human consumption?
Genetic information passed from parent to offspring via DNA provides for 
continuity of life. In order for information in DNA to direct cellular activities, it must 
be transcribed into RNA. Some of the RNAs are used immediately for ribosomes or 
to control other cellular processes. Other RNAs are translated into proteins that have 
important roles in determining metabolism and development, i.e., cellular activities 
and phenotypes (traits). When the DNA of a cell changes, the RNAs and proteins they 
produce often change, which in turn changes how that cell functions. 
DNA inside a cell can change several ways. It can be mutated, either spontaneously 
or after the DNA replication machinery makes an error. Biotechnologists may cause an 
intentional mutation in a cell’s own DNA as a way to change how that cell behave
