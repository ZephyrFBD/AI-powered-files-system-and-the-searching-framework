CHAPTER 27
†We include Z in our derivation so that we can treat other single-electron (“hydrogenlike”) atoms
such as the ions 
and 
Helium in the neutral state has two electrons; if one
electron is missing, the remaining 
ion consists of one electron revolving around a nucleus of
charge 
Similarly, doubly ionized lithium,
also has a single electron, and in this case 
‡Be careful not to believe that these well-defined orbits actually exist. Today electrons are better
thought of as forming “clouds,” as discussed in Chapter 28.
