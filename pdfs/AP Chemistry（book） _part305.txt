mallest 
whole-number ratios. The smallest ratios are obtained  
by dividing each subscript by the largest common factor,  
in this case 6. The  
resultant empirical formula for glucose  
is CH2O.
(b)  
Because the subscripts in N2O are already the lowest integral 
numbers, the empirical formula for nitrous oxide is the same 
as its molecular formula, N2O.

Tetracarbon dioxide is an unstable oxide of carbon with the 
 
following molecular structure:
Give It Some Thought 
Consider the following four formulas: SO2, B2H6, CO, C4H2O2. Which of these 
formulas could be (a) only an empirical formula, (b) only a molecular formula,  
(c) either a molecular or an empirical formula?
Whenever we know the molecular formula of a compound, we can determine its 
empirical formula. The converse is not true, however. If we know the empirical formula of 
a substance, we cannot determine its molecular formula unless we have more information. 
So why do chemists bother with empirical
