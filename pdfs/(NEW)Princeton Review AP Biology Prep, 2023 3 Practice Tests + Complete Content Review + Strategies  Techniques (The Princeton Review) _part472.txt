e y-axis. For
example, suppose you counted the number of pine needles on each branch of a Pinus strobus tree. A histogram of
this data may look like this.
This dataset does not match a normal distribution, meaning it is a nonparametric dataset. Keep in mind that even if a
certain dataset is not normal, the population itself could be. There could have been sampling bias or errors in the
data collection, which can lead to sample data that doesnâ€™t match population data. The best way to fix this is usually
to increase the sample size. Histograms differ from bar graphs in that they show ranges instead of just categories.
Nonparametric data requires a different set of descriptive statistics than parametric data.
The median is the middle number in a dataset and is determined by putting the numbers in consecutive order and
finding the middle number. If there is an odd number of numbers, there will be a single number that is the median. If
there is an even number of numbers, the median is deter
