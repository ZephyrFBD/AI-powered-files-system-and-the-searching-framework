ity, tending to pull it back to the vertical position); so for
part (2), we cannot use conservation of momentum. But we can use conservation
of mechanical energy because gravity is a conservative force (Chapter 6). The
kinetic energy immediately after the collision is changed entirely to gravitational
potential energy when the pendulum reaches its maximum height, h.
SOLUTION In part (1) momentum is conserved:
(i)
where 
is the speed of the block and embedded projectile just after the colli-
sion, before they have moved significantly.
In part (2), mechanical energy is conserved. We choose
when the
pendulum hangs vertically, and then
when the pendulumâ€“projectile
system reaches its maximum height. Thus we write
or
(ii)
We solve for 
Inserting this result for 
into Eq. (i) above, and solving for v, gives 
which is our final result.
NOTE The separation of the process into two parts was crucial. Such an analysis is
a powerful problem-solving tool. But how do you decide how to make such a
