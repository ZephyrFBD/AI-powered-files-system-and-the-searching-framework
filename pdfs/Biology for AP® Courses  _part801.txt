investment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.
Figure 7.6 The first half of glycolysis uses two ATP molecules in the phosphorylation of glucose, which is then split
into two three-carbon molecules.
Second Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Releasing Steps)
So far, glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules. Both of these
molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two
ATP molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even
higher-energy NADH molecules.
Step 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (Figure 7.7) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy
electrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD+, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the
addition of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. N
