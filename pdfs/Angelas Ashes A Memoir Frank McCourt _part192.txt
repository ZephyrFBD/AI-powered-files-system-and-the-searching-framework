’s head. He wraps his hand 
 
 in the dish rag and tells Mam,Quick,quick, wipe the blood off the Pope 
 
 before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it’s 
 
 wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope’s face is 
 
 smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you’ve destroyed the Pope 
 
 entirely, and she says,Arrah, stop your whining,we’ll get some paint and 
 
 go over his face some day, and Dad says, He’s the only Pope that was 
 
 ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone 
 
 from the St.Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over 
 
 him? Mam says, I don’t know. It’s your blood and ’tis a sad thing when 
 
 a man can’t even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless 
 
 you are.You’d be better off digging fields and anyway I don’t care. I have 
 
 pain in my back and I’m going to bed. 
 
 Och, what am I going to do? Dad says. 
 
 Take down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs
