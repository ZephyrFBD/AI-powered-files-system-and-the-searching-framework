f graph, one that will show the steepness, or 
slope, of the progress curve. Because the slope of the progress curve is a measure of the 
speed of velocity, or rate of the reaction or process, such a graph is frequently called a 
“rate graph” or “rate curve.” The diagram in Figure A.11 shows how a rate curve can be 
made for Process I.

Notice that the time scale of this rate graph is exactly like the time scale of the progress 
curve from which it was derived, but that the ordinate is different. The ordinate of the 
progress curve shows milligrams of A remaining; the ordinate of the rate curve shows 
milligrams of A used per hour. Obviously, a rate graph must always show rate on one 
of its scales, and it is ordinarily the vertical one that i
