In this case n = 2 (two electrons are transferred from Zn to Cu2+), and the standard emf is 
+1.10 V. 
 (Section 20.4) Thus, at 298 K the Nernst equation gives
 
E = 1.10 V - 0.0592 V

Recall that pure solids are excluded from the expression for Q. 
 (Section 15.6) Accord-
ing to Equation 20.19, the emf increases as 3Cu2+4 increases and as 3Zn2+4 decreases. For 
example, when 3Cu2+4 is 5.0 M and 3Zn2+4 is 0.050 M, we have
 
E = 1.10 V - 0.0592 V

1-2.002 = 1.16 V
Thus, increasing the concentration of reactant Cu2+ and decreasing the concentration of 
product Zn2+ relative to standard conditions increases the emf of the cell relative to stan-
dard conditions 1E° = +1.10 V2.
The Nernst equation helps us understand why the emf of a voltaic cell drops as the 
cell discharges. As reactants are converted to products, the value of Q increases, so the 
value of E decreases, eventual
