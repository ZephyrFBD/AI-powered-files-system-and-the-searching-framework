nverts the energy of the
scintillator-emitted photon(s) into an electric signal. A PM tube is a vacuum 
tube containing several electrodes (typically 8 to 14), called dynodes, which are
maintained at successively higher voltages as shown in Fig. 30–14. At its top
surface is a photoelectric surface, called the photocathode, whose work function
(Section 27–3) is low enough that an electron is easily released when struck by a
photon from the scintillator. Such an electron is accelerated toward the positive
voltage of the first dynode. When it strikes the first dynode, the electron has
acquired sufficient kinetic energy so that it can eject two to five more electrons.
These, in turn, are accelerated toward the higher voltage second dynode, and a
multiplication process begins. The number of electrons striking the last dynode
may be 
or more. Thus the passage of a particle through the scintillator results
in an electric signal at the output of the PM tube that can be sent to an electronic
co
