of nitrogen bases in which adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.
Later research elucidated the flow of information from genes, the hereditary units of DNA, to traits. In the one-gene-
one-enzyme hypothesis, the gene was defined as the segment of DNA that codes for a particular enzyme. But
because many genes code for polypeptides that are not enzymes (such as structural proteins, regulatory proteins, or
individual components of enzymes), the gene has since been redefined as the DNA segment that codes for a
particular polypeptide (one-gene-one-polypeptide hypothesis). In Chapter8, “Heredity,” the terms gene and
genotype are used to represent the genetic information for a particular trait. From the molecular viewpoint presented
in this chapter, traits are the end products of metabolic processes regulated by enzymes.
DNA Replication
During interphase of the cell cycle, a second chromatid containing a copy of the DNA molecule is assembled. The
process, called
