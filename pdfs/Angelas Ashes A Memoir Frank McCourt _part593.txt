a blind son stumbling 
 
 through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, 
 
 now you want to go blind on top of it. 
 
 And I can’t stop crying now because this was my one chance to be 
 
 a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from 
 
 my father. I can’t stop crying because I don’t know what Mr. Hannon 
 
 is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him 
 
 pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. 
 
  
  
 I can’t stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet 
 
 because he’s so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon 
 
 isn’t there to take him out, if I’m not there to take him out? Will 
 
 that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd 
 
 apple? 
 
 Mam says I shouldn’t be crying, it’s bad for the eyes. She says,We’ll 
 
 see. That’s all I can tell you now.We’ll see. 
 
 She washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malach
