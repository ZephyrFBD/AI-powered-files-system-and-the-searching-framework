ing organisms requires energy. Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise.
Humans also use a great deal of energy while thinking and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism
constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported, metabolized (broken down), synthesized into new
molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and, in some cases, distributed to the entire organism. For
example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller molecules. Complex carbohydrates are
broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building,
energy is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules. Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones
and neurotransmitters are actively transported between cells. Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are ingested and broken down
by cells. Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay healthy. Ma
