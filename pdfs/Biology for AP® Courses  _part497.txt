roteins and synthesizes phospholipids used in cell membranes. The SER synthesizes carbohydrates,
lipids, and steroid hormones; engages in the detoxification of medications and poisons; and stores calcium ions. Sorting,
tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes are created by the
budding of the membranes of the RER and Golgi. Lysosomes digest macromolecules, recycle worn-out organelles, and
destroy pathogens.
4.5 Cytoskeleton
The cytoskeleton has three different types of protein elements. From narrowest to widest, they are the microfilaments
(actin filaments), intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Microfilaments are often associated with myosin. They
provide rigidity and shape to the cell and facilitate cellular movements. Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the
nucleus and other organelles in place. Microtubules help the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for motor proteins that
move vesicles through th
