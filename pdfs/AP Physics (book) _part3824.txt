A–7 Trigonometric Functions and Identities
Trigonometric functions for any angle are defined by constructing a right triangle
about that angle as shown in Fig. A–6; opp and adj are the lengths of the sides
opposite and adjacent to the angle 
and hyp is the length of the hypotenuse:
(Pythagorean theorem).
Figure A–7 shows the signs 
that cosine, sine, and tangent take on for
angles in the four quadrants (0° to 360°). Note that angles are measured coun-
terclockwise from the x axis as shown; negative angles are measured from 
below the x axis, clockwise: for example,
and so on.
The following are some useful identities among the trigonometric functions:
For any triangle (see Fig.A–8):
