A neon tube is a thin glass tube,
moldable into various shapes,
filled with neon (or other) gas
that glows with a particular color
when a current at high voltage
passes through it. Gas atoms,
excited to upper energy levels,
jump down to lower energy
levels and emit light (photons)
whose wavelengths (color) are
characteristic of the type of gas.
In this Chapter we study what
quantum mechanics tells us
about atoms, their energy levels,
and the effect of the exclusion
principle for atoms wi
