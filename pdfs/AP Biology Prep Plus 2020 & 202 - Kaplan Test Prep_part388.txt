of chloroplasts containing DPIP was divided among 4 tubes. The
samples were then exposed to light (1,500 lumens) and/or heat (a
temperature of 85Â°C), and light transmittance was measured over
time using a spectrophotometer. Higher transmittance is
correlated to lighter color. The results of the experiment are
provided below.

Which of the following can most reasonably be concluded from
the experimental results?
The onset of photosynthesis is visible when DPIP is oxidized
and changes from clear to blue.
(A)
Chloroplasts exposed to heat had the highest rate of
photosynthesis.
(B)
Photosynthesis is stimulated when chloroplasts are exposed
to light only.
(C)
The solution in all four tubes was clear at time 0.
(D)
