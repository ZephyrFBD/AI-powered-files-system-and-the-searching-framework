called spiracles and travels through a system of tracheal tubes in
the body, where diffusion occurs in sinuses or hemocoels. In
arthropods and in some mollusks, oxygen is carried by
hemocyanin, a molecule similar to hemoglobin but with copper,
instead of iron, as its core atom.
Aquatic animals like fish have gills that take advantage of
countercurrent exchange to maximize the diffusion of respiratory
gases.
GAS EXCHANGE IN HUMANS
In humans, air enters the nasal cavity and is moistened, warmed, and
filtered. From there, air passes through the larynx and down the trachea

and bronchi into the tiniest bronchioles, which end in microscopic air
sacs called alveoli where diffusion of respiratory gases occurs; see Figure
15.2. Humans have an internal respiratory surface. As the rib cage
expands and the diaphragm contracts and lowers, the chest cavity
expands, making the internal pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.
Thus, air is drawn into
