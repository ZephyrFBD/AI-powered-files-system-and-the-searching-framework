ams per mole, so we divide 
the number of grams of solute 10.250 g2 by the number of moles 
we have just calculated.
Solve 
From Equation 13.12, we have:
Molality =
∆T
b
iKb
=
0.357 °C
1125.02 °C>m = 0.0711 m
Thus, the solution contains 0.0711 mol of solute per kilogram 
of solvent. The solution was prepared using 40.0 g = 0.0400 kg 
of solvent 1CCl42. The number of moles of solute in the solu-
tion is therefore:
10.0400 kg CCl42a0.0711 mol solute
kg CCl4
b = 2.84 * 10-3 mol solute
The molar mass of the solute is the number of grams per mole 
of the substance:
Molar mass =
0.250 g
2.84 * 10-3 mol
= 88.0 g>mol
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
A mysterious white powder could be powdered sugar 
1C12H22O112, cocaine 1C17H21NO42, codeine 1C18H21NO32, 
norfenefrine 1C8H11NO22, or fructose 1C6H12O62. 
When 80 mg of the powder is dissolved in 1.50 mL 
of ethanol 1d = 0.789 g>cm3, normal freezing point 
-114.6 °C, Kf = 1.99 °C>m2, the freezing point is lowered  
to -115.5 °C. What is the identity of the
