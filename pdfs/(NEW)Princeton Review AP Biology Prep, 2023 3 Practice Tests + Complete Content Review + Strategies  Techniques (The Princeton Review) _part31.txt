ntermembrane proteins that will anchor to the cell surface, or proteins that
will be members of the secretory pathway that packs and ships things towards the cell surface. A
targeting signal is a sequence that identifies the proteins of the secretory pathway. A localization
signal is a sequence that labels proteins that are destined to go to specific organelles (that are not
part of the secretory pathway). The table below shows seven eukaryotic proteins, and the
sequences have been identified in each.

23. Which of following could be a description for HRIET1?
(A) A protein found in the blood that plays a role in the immune system
(B) A protein found in the Golgi apparatus that helps tether vesicles
(C) A protein found in the nucleolus aiding in ribosome assembly
(D) A protein found in the cytosol serving as a c
