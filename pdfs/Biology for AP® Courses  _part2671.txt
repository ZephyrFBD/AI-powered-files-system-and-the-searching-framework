Xerophytes and epiphytes often have a thick covering of trichomes or of stomata that are sunken below the leafâ€™s surface.
Trichomes are specialized hair-like epidermal cells that secrete oils and substances. These adaptations impede air flow

Transportation of Photosynthates in the Phloem
Plants need an energy source to grow. In seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by
metabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants. Once gree
