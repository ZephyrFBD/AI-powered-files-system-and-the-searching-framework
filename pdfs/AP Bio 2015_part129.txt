rature. 
Explain the observed shift of the plants to lower elevations by doing each of the following. 
Propose a hypothesis about an environmental factor other than temperature that could be 
driving the shift to lower elevations.  
Describe ONE piece of evidence that a researcher could use to support your hypothesis. 
Provide reasoning to connect the evidence with the environmental factor you proposed.

Hypothesis  
(1 point) 
Evidence (1 point) 
(Must be measurable and express comparison 
between lower and higher elevations) 
Reasoning  
(1 point) 
Water 
Higher soil moisture/rainfall data/meteorological 
data at lower elevations 
Low water availability at high 
elevation limits plant growth 
CO2 
More CO2 at low compared to high elevations 
Low CO2 levels at high elevation 
limit plant growth 
Light  
(visible and/or 
UV) 
Higher visible light at lower elevations 
More photosynthesis with more 
visible light 
Lower UV
