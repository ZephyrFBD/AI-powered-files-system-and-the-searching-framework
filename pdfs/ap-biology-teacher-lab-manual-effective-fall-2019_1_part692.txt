physical science laboratory, and the experiments can be performed using a 0.1-mL or 
1.0-mL pipette in place of a gas pressure sensor. (The size of the pipette depends on the 
diameter of the stem from the plant used for investigation. Some plants naturally have 
larger stems!) 
If students are unfamiliar with the use of the gas pressure sensor and computer 
interface, they may have to review their use prior to collecting data. The applications of 
mathematics are straightforward, and itâ€™s your choice whether you provide students with 
formulas, data tables, and graph paper. However, it is suggested that students develop 
their own visuals to record their data. It also is recommended that students help each 
other analyze data and present their individual/group data and conclusions to the class 
as a means to develop both written and verbal communication skills. Refer to Chapter 6
