wing statements regarding the 
kinetic-molecular theory of gases are correct. (a) The average 
kinetic energy of a collection of gas molecules at a given tem-
perature is proportional to m1>2. (b) The gas molecules are as-
sumed to exert no forces on each other. (c) All the molecules 
of a gas at a given temperature have the same kinetic energy. 
(d) The volume of the gas molecules is negligible in compari-
son to the total volume in which the gas is contained. (e) All 
gas molecules move with the same speed if they are at the same 
temperature.
  
 
 
 10.77 WF6 is one of the heaviest known gases. How much slower is 
the root-mean-square speed of WF6 than He at 300 K?
[10.78] You have an evacuated container of fixed volume and 
known mass and introduce a known mass of a gas sample. 
Measuring the pressure at constant temperature over time, 
you are surprised to see it slowly dropping. You measure the 
mass of the gas-filled container and find that the mass is 
what it should beâ€”gas pl
