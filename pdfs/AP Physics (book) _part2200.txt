FIGURE 20–17 Force exerted by a
uniform magnetic field on a moving
charged particle (in this case, an
electron) produces a circular path.
EXERCISE F Determine the force on the proton of Example 20–4 if it heads horizon-
tally south.
Magnetic force on ions during a nerve pulse.
Estimate the magnitude of the magnetic force due to the Earth’s magnetic field
on ions crossing a cell membrane during an action potential (Section 18–10).
Assume the speed of the ions is 
.
APPROACH Using
set the magnetic field of the Earth to be roughly
and the charge
SOLUTION
NOTE This is an extremely small force. Yet it is thought that migrating animals
do somehow detect the Earth’s magnetic field, and this is an area of active
research.
