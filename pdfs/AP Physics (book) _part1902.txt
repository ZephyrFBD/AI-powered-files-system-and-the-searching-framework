“interlaced,” meaning all the odd rows (half the picture) are done in

Oscilloscopes
An oscilloscope is a device for amplifying, measuring, and visually displaying an
electrical signal as a function of time on an LCD or CRT monitor, or computer
screen. The visible “trace” on the screen, which could be an electrocardiogram
(Fig. 17–36), or a signal from an experiment on nerve conduction, is a plot of the
signal voltage (vertically) versus time (horizontally). [In a CRT, the electron
beam is swept horizontally at a uniform rate in time by the horizontal deflection
plates, Figs. 17–29 and 17–30. The signal
