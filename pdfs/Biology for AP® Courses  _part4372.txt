Yeast is grown under ideal conditions, so the curve reflects limitations of resources in the controlled
environment. Seals live in a natural environment where the same types of resources are limited; but, they
face another pressure of migration of seals out of the population.
Section Summary
Populations with unlimited resources grow exponentially, with an accelerating growth rate. When resources become
limiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve. The population of a species will level off at the carrying capacity of its
environment.
