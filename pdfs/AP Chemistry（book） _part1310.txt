 112.14 g C2a 1 mol C
12.01 g C b = 1.011 mol C
 116.17 g O2a 1 mol O
16.00 g O b = 1.011 mol O
 171.69 g Cl2a 1 mol Cl
35.45 g Cl b = 2.022 mol Cl
Thus, the reaction involves breaking a C ‚ O bond 
and a Cl¬Cl bond and forming a C “O bond and 
two C ¬Cl bonds. Using bond enthalpies from  
Table 8.3, we have:
(a) The empirical formula of phosgene can be  
determined from its elemental composition.  
 (Section 3.5) Assuming 100 g of the compound 
and calculating the number of moles of C, O, and 
Cl in this sample, we have:
The ratio of the number of moles of each element, 
obtained by dividing each number of moles by the 
smallest quantity, indicates that there is one C and one 
O for each two Cl in the empirical formula, COCl2.
The molar mass of the empirical formula is 
12.01 + 16.00 + 2135.452 = 98.91 g>mol, the 
same as the molar mass of the molecule. Thus, 
COCl2 is the molecular formula.
