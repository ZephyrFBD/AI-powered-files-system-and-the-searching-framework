cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or “crack,” is called the cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring
contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two (Figure 10.9).
In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates
enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing
cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at
the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell
plate. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cel
