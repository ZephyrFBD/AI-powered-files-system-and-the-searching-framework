Think About It
•
Why do scientists think that photosynthesis evolved before aerobic cellular respiration?
•
Why do carnivores, such as lions, depend on photosynthesis to survive? What evidence supports the claim that
photosynthesis and cellular respiration are interdependent processes?
Main Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as
substrates (Figure 8.4). After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P),
simple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be
