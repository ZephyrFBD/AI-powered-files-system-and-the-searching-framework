 necessary
for life on Earth might have come from outer space. That might be
true. However, the purpose of Millerâ€™s experiments was to
demonstrate that the molecules necessary for life to develop could
have formed under the conditions of early Earth. He did not succeed
in demonstrating that the first molecules were self-replicating.
(B) Graph A shows the absorption spectrum for chlorophyll that was
extracted from a living plant. Once separated from the grana and
stroma, chlorophyll by itself cannot carry out photosynthesis.

(D) Ribosomes produce protein for export. Once synthesized, the
protein is packaged into vesicles in the Golgi for secretion. The
graph shows that the amount of CFTR is high where synthesis
occurs, in the ER, and low in the vesicles and Golgi. So, the CFTR
protein was synthesized in the ribosomes but not packaged in the
Golgi. Choice A is incorrect because transcription must have already
occurred since the
