viruses that have infected other animals, like pigs and chickens. This is
called horizontal gene transfer. When this happens, the viral strain may
become completely unrecognizable by our immune system. Viral
transformation was the cause of the great pan-European flu epidemic of
1918–1919, which killed 20 million people. A virus’s ability to jump from
one species to another, from pigs to humans, was also the cause of the
H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009. Luckily, in that case, scientists were able to
make an effective H1N1 vaccine that averted an even greater disaster.
Overview of the Immune System
The immune system has four major characteristics:
SPECIFICITY: The entire system depends on the matching of
antigens to antigen receptors and the matching of antigens to
antibodies.
DIVERSITY: A wide variety of different cell types defend our bodies
from pathogens.
MEMORY: B and T memory cells circulate for a lifetime, which
results in a stronger and faster response to an antigen encountered
