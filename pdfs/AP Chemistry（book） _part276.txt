electrons as an indistinct cloud will become clear in later chapters when we consider 
the energies and spatial arrangements of the electrons. For now, however, we have all 
the information we need to discuss many topics that form the basis of everyday uses of 
chemistry.
Atomic Numbers, Mass Numbers, and Isotopes
What makes an atom of one element different from an atom of another element? The 
atoms of each element have a characteristic number of protons. The number of protons in 
an atom of any particular element is called that element’s atomic number. Because 
an atom has no net electrical charge, the number of electrons it contains must equal the 
number of protons. All atoms of carbon, for example, have six protons and six electrons, 
whereas all atoms of oxygen have eight protons and eight elec
