The Common-Ion Effect (Section 17.1)
 17.13  Which of these statements about the common-ion effect is 
most correct? (a) The solubility of a salt MA is decreased in 
a solution that already contains either M+ or A-. (b) Com-
mon ions alter the equilibrium constant for the reaction of 
an ionic solid with water. (c) The common-ion effect does 
not apply to unusual ions like SO3
2 -. (d) The solubility of a 
salt MA is affected equally by the addition of either A- or a 
noncommon ion. 
 17.14  Consider the equilibrium
B1aq2 + H2O1l2 âˆ† HB+1aq2 + OH-1aq2.
 
 Suppose that a salt of HB+1
