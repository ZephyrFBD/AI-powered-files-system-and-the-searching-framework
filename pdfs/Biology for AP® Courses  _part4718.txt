e eggs of other species of cichlid. The cichlids of Lake Victoria
are the product of an adaptive radiation. An adaptive radiation is a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the
Lake Victoria cichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species; typically, the
species “radiate” into different habitats and niches. The Galápagos finches are an example of a modest adaptive radiation
with 15 species. The cichlids of Lake Victoria are an example of a spectacular adaptive radiation that includes about 500
species.
At the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear. A culprit in these declines was
a species of large fish that was introduced to Lake Victoria by fisheries to feed the people living around the lake. The Nile
perch was introduced in 1963, but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge. The Nile perch population
grew by consuming cichlids, driving species after species t
