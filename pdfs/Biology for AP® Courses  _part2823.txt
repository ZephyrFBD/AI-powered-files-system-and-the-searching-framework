Connection for AP® Courses
The content described in this section is not within the scope of AP®. However, we have already learned that the relationship
between structure and function includes the cellular level, and we will continue to reinforce that when we explore the
nervous system later.
The tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Recall
that tissues are groups of similar cells group of similar cells carrying out related functions. These tissues combine to form
organs—like the skin o
