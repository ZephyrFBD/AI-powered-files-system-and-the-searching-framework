 2A), are 
those in which the valence s orbitals are being filled. These two columns make up the s 
block of the periodic table.
On the right is a block of six pink columns that comprises the p block, where the 
valence p orbitals are being filled. The s block and the p block elements together are the 
representative elements, sometimes called the main-group elements.
The orange block in Figure 6.30 has ten columns containing the transition 
 
metals. These are the elements in which the valence d orbitals are being filled and make 
up the d block.
The elements in the two tan rows containing 14 columns are the ones in which the 
valence f orbitals are being filled and make up the f   block. Consequently, these elements 
are often referred to as the f-block metals. In most tables, the f  block is positioned 
below the periodic table to save space:
