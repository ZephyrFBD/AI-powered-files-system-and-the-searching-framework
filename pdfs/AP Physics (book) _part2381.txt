the maximum (peak) values of these voltages. The voltage across each of the 
elements will follow the phase relations we discussed in the previous Section. At
any instant the voltage V supplied by the source will be, by Kirchhoffâ€™s loop rule,

Because the various voltages are not in phase, they do not reach their peak values at
the same time, so the peak voltage of the source 
will not equal
Phasor Diagrams
The current in an LRC circuit at any instant is the same at all points in the circuit
(charge does not pile up in the wires). Thus the currents in each element are in
phase with each other, even though the voltages are not. We choose our origin 
in time 
so that the current I at any time is
AC circuits are complicated to analyze. The easiest approach is to use a sort
of vector device known as a phasor diagram. Arrows (treated like
