ngle plant sources.
c.
Plant proteins contain only non-essential amino acids.
d.
Plants proteins do not have all of the non-essential amino acids, but do contain the essential amino acids.
Think About It
•
Predict what happens if even one amino acid is substituted for another in a polypeptide and provide a
specific example.
•
What categories of amino acids would you expect to find on the surface of a soluble protein, and which
would you expect to find in the interior? What distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in a
protein embedded in a lipid bilayer of a plasma cell membrane?
Activity
Folding is an important property of proteins, especially enzymes. Proteins have a narrow range of conditions
in which they fold properly; outside that range, proteins can unfold (denature) and often cannot refold and
become functional again. Investigate one disease that results from improper folding of a protein. Describe
causes of the unfolding and consequences to the molecular structure
