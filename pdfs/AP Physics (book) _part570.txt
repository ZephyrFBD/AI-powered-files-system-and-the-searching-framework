), or (d); or are they (e) all the same? On which run
would her speed at the bottom be the fastest if the runs are
icy and we assume no friction or air resistance? Recogniz-
ing that there is always some friction, answer the above two
questions again. List your four answers now.
U
ntil now we have been studying the translational motion of an object in
terms of Newtonâ€™s three laws of motion. In that analysis, force has played
a central role as the quantity determining the motion. In this Chapter
and the next, we discuss an alternative analysis of the translational motion of
objects in terms of the quantities energy and momentum. The significance of
energy and momentum is that they are conserved. That is, in quite general cir-
cumstances they remain constant. That conserved quantities exist gives us not only
a deeper insight into the nature of the world, but also gives us another way to
approach solving practical problems.
The conservation laws of energy and momentum are especially valua
