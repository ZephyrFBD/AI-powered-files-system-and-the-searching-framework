l organisms use DNA polymerase to replicate their genomes. However,
whereas organisms with small genomes can get away with just a single polymerase molecule working at one point in the
genome at time, organisms with larger genomes replicate many points of the genome simultaneously. Other organisms
that live in extremely hot environments, such as deep-sea thermal vents, have specialized polymerase molecules that can
withstand the heat that would quickly denature the polymerases in land-based animals. Although the basis for each of these
different DNA polymerase molecules is the same, each one has been adapted to function in the organismâ€™s environmental
niche.
Misconceptions of Evolution
Although the theory of evolution generated some controversy when it was first proposed, it was almost universally accepted
by biologists, particularly younger biologists, within 20 years after publication of On the Origin of Species. Nevertheless,
the theory of evolution is a difficult concept and miscon
