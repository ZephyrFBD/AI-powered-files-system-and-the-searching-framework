f 4.2% of the to-
tal volume is ethanol and the density of ethanol is 
0.789 g/mL, what mass of ethanol does a 12-oz serv-
ing of light beer contain? (d) How many Calories are 
 
released by the metabolism of ethanol, the reaction from 
part (a)? (e) What percentage of the 110 Calories comes 
from the ethanol?
design an Experiment
One of the important ideas of thermodynamics is that energy can be 
transferred in the form of heat or work. Imagine that you lived 180 
years ago when the relationships between heat and work were not 
well understood. You have formulated a hypothesis that work can 
be converted to heat with the same amount of work always gener-
ating the same amount of heat. To test this idea, you have designed 
an experiment using a device in which a falling weight is connected 
through pulleys to a shaft with an attached paddle wheel that is im-
mersed in water. This is actually a classic experiment performed by 
James Joule in the 1840s. You can see various images of Joul
