ide base pairing that is conserved 
through evolution: adenine pairs with thymine 
or uracil (A-T or A-U) and cytosine pairs with 
guanine (C-G)—
a. Purines (G and A) have a double 
ring structure.
b. Pyrimidines (C, T, and U) have a single 
ring structure.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
IST-1.M
Describe the mechanisms 
by which genetic information 
is copied for transmission 
between generations.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.M.1
DNA replication ensures continuity of 
hereditary information—
a. DNA is synthesized in the 5’ to 3’ direction.
b. Replication is a semiconservative  
process—that is, one strand of DNA 
serves as the template for a new strand 
of complementary DNA.
c. Helicase unwinds the DNA strands.
d. Topoisomerase relaxes supercoiling in front 
of the replication fork. 
e. DNA
