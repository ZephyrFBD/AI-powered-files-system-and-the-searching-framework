Based on his initial findings, the researcher carried out another
experiment. His hypothesis was that there can be a horizontal
transfer of genes between and among bacteria. He injected an X-
strain of S. pneumoniae that had been heat-killed into a mouse. This
time, the mouse remained healthy. Next, he injected a mouse with
the heat-killed X-strain along with the living Y-strain.
Assume that the researcher’s hypothesis was correct and that
bacteria can transfer genetic material from one bacterium to another.
Predict what happened when the heat-killed X-strain plus the living
Y-strain was injected into the mouse.
The mouse lived, and a biopsy revealed there was live Y-strain
bacteria in the mouse’s bloodstream.
The mouse lived, and a biopsy revealed there was live X-strain
bacteria in the mouse’s bloodstream.
The mouse died, and an autopsy revealed there was live Y-
strain bacteria in the mouse.
