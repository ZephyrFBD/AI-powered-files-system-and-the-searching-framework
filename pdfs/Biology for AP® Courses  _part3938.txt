ns as the immune barrier and
response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems
use many of the same cell types. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells
called M cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. M cells function in the transport described,

and are located in the Peyerâ€™s patch, a lymphoid nodule. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells,
with B cells and macrophages having minor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the
MALT and at various mucosal induction sites, such as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the
intestine. Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of
infection.
