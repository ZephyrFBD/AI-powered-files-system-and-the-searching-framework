cating RNA molecules, and we may speculate that
such a molecular system could have worked in early life, that’s the
extent of what we can conclude. Spontaneous generation, as
mentioned in (C), is the formation of living organisms without descent
from similar organisms (such as mice spontaneously forming from rags
or maggots spontaneously forming from meat). An RNA molecule that
can self-replicate in a test tube lacks many of the fundamental
properties of life, such as a membrane. Therefore, this is not a correct
choice. (D) is incorrect because the experiment supported the RNA
world hypothesis. It showed that RNA could act as an information
molecule while simultaneously acting as an enzyme capable of
copying that information.

The misunderstanding demonstrated by this criticism is that evolution
relies entirely on random processes, but natural selection is
nonrandom. Therefore, (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because
evolution is not goal directed. Organism
