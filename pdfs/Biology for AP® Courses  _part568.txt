he cell to its interior
(Figure 5.10); depending on the gradient, the material may move in the opposite direction. Carrier proteins are typically
specific for a single substance. This selectivity adds to the overall selectivity of the plasma membrane. The exact mechanism
for the change of shape is poorly understood. Proteins can change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected, but this
may not fully explain this mechanism. Each carrier protein is specific to one substance, and there are a finite number of
these proteins in any membrane. This can cause problems in transporting enough of the material for the cell to function
properly. When all of the proteins are bound to their ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum.
Increasing the concentration gradient at this point will not result in an increased rate of transport.

the aid of carrier prote
