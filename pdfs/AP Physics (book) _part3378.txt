umber. This simple unit of activity is called the
becquerel:
as discussed in Chapter 31.
Safety: Activity versus half-life. One
might think that a short half-life material is safer than a long half-life material
because it will not last as long. Is that true?
RESPONSE No. A shorter half-life means the activity is higher and thus more
“radioactive” and can cause more biological damage. In contrast, a longer half-life
for the same sample size N means a lower activity but we have to worry about it
for longer and find safe storage until it reaches a safe (low) level of activity.

which has a half-life of 10.0 min (600 s). (a) How many nuclei are
present initially? (b) What is the rate of decay (activity) initially? (c) What is the
activity after 1.00 h? (d) After approximately how long will the activity drop to less
than one per second
APPROACH We use the definition of the mole and Avogadro’s number
(Sections 13–6 and 13–8) to find (a) the
