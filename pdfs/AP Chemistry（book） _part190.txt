 in Figure 1.26. From the data provided, 
calculate the density of the gas at 25 °C.
SOLUTION
To calculate the density, we must know both the mass and the 
volume of the gas. The mass of the gas is just the difference in the 
masses of the full and empty container:
837.63 g
-836.25 g
1.38 g
In subtracting numbers, we determine the number of significant 
figures in our result by counting decimal places in each quantity. 
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
You are asked to determine the mass of a piece of copper using its 
reported density, 8.96 g/mL, and a 150-mL graduated cylinder. 
First, you add 105 mL of water to the graduated cylinder; then 
you place the piece of copper in the cylinder and record a volume 
of 137 mL. What is the mass of the copper reported with the cor-
rect number of significant figures? (a) 287 g (b) 3.5 * 10-3 g/mL 
(c) 286.72 g/mL (d) 3.48 * 10-3 g/mL (e) 2.9 * 102 g/mL
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
If the mass of the container in the sample exercise (Figure 1.26) 
were measured
