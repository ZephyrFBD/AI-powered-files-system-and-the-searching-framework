y
fitting together the most stable pieces of diﬀerent
chromosomes.
(A)
The organism is able to swap out damaged or mutated
portions of chromosomes, thereby improving the health and
fitness of the resultant gametes.
(B)
Organisms can create superior oﬀspring by combining only
the best genes of each chromosome and passing on only
those copies with good genes.
(C)
The random shuﬀling of genetic material allows for greater
genetic diversity among oﬀspring, thereby increasing the
general fitness of a population.
(D)
5. A homozygous red apple (RR) tree was crossed with a
homozygous yellow apple (yy) tree resulting in first generation
oﬀspring that produced only red apples. Next, a first generation
oﬀspring is crossed with a yellow apple tree and 10 second
generation oﬀspring are produced. If the second generation
oﬀspring consisted of 6 red apple trees and 4 yellow apple trees,
would this be statistically diﬀerent from what would be expected
from Mendelian ratios?
