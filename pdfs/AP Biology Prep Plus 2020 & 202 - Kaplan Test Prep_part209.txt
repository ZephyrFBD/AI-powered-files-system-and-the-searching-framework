r plasmids to be taken up by other bacteria. The
uptake and incorporation of the exogenous (foreign) DNA into a host
(recipient) bacterium is called transformation. For transformation to
occur, the host cell must be competentâ€”the cell membrane becomes
more permeable to allow the DNA to pass from the environment into the
cell. Transformation works best between closely-related species and
results in a stable genetic change. In a laboratory setting, artificial
competence can be obtained by exposing cells to calcium chloride and
heat shock or by using electrical pulses to create pores in the cell
membrane.
Transduction
Introducing exogenous DNA into a bacterium by a virus is called
transduction. The bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) injects
viral DNA into a host bacterium and breaks down the host DNA. Infected
by the phage, the host cell (donor) creates new phages that may contain
host DNA packaged in the viral capsid. Bacterial lysis releases the new
phages, which inject the h
