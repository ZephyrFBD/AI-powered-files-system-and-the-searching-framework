ere is an important difference between a double-slit and a multiple-slit
pattern. The bright maxima are much sharper and narrower for a grating. Why?
Suppose the angle 
in Fig. 24–24 is increased just slightly beyond 
required 
for a maximum. For only two slits, the two waves will be only slightly out of 
phase, so nearly full constructive interference occurs. This means the maxima are
wide (see Fig. 24–9). For a grating, the waves from two adjacent slits will also 
not be significantly out of phase. But waves from one slit and those from a
second one a few hundred slits away may be exactly out of phase; all or nearly 
all the light can cancel in pairs in this way. For example, suppose the angle 
is very slightly different from its first-order maximum, so that the extra path
length for a pair of adjacent slits is not exactly 
but rather 
The wave
through one slit and another one 500 slits below will have a path difference of
or
wavelengths, so the two will be out of phase
and cancel. A
