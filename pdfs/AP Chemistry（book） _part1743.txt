of mat-
ter—solid, liquid, gas—can transform into either of the other two 
states. Figure 11.20 shows the names associated with these trans-
formations, which are called either phase changes or changes 
of state.
energy Changes Accompany Phase Changes
Every phase change is accompanied by a change in the energy of the system. In a solid, 
for example, the particles (molecules, ions, or atoms) are in more or less fixed positions 
with respect to one another and closely arranged to minimize the energy of the sys-
tem. As the temperature of the solid increases, the particles vibrate about their equilib-
rium positions with increasing energetic motion. When the solid melts, the particles 
begin moving freely relative to one another, which means their average kinetic energy 
increases.
Melting is called (somewhat confusingly) fusion. The increased freedom of motion 
of the particles requires energy, measured by the heat of fusion or enthalpy of fusion, 
∆Hfus. The heat of fusion of ice, for
