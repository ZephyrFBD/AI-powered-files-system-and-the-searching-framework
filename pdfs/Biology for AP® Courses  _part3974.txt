s. That is also
why cortisone is used to treat such responses: it will inhibit cytokine production.
Autoimmunity
Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population. Most
types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response. Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as
foreign are termed autoantibodies. In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, muscle cell receptors that
induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies. The result is muscle weakness that may include
marked difficultly with fine and/or gross motor functions. In systemic lupus erythematosus, a diffuse autoantibody response
to the individualâ€™s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases. As illustrated in Figure 33.28, systemic
lupus erythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue
damage via antibody binding, co
