 very dry, and so the water is rapidly evaporating 
from your cup and cooling it. (b) High in the mountains, 
it is probably very windy, and so the water is rapidly evapo-
rating from your cup and cooling it. (c) High in the moun-
tains, the air pressure is signiﬁcantly less than 1 atm, so 
the boiling point of water is much lower than at sea level.  
(d) High in the mountains, the air pressure is signiﬁcantly 
less than 1 atm, so the boiling point of water is much higher 
than at sea level.
 11.55  Using the vapor-pressure curves in Figure 11.25, (a) estimate 
the boiling point of ethanol at an external pressure of 200 
torr, (b) estimate the external pressure at which ethanol 
will boil at 60 °C, (c) estimate the boiling point of diethyl 
ether at 400 torr, (d) estimate the external pressure at which 
diethyl ether will boil at 40 °C.
