s in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-celled organisms.
After a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. Some unicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo
binary fission by mitosis. In other organisms, part of the individual separates and forms a second individual. This process
occurs, for example, in many asteroid echinoderms through splitting of the central disk. Some sea anemones and some coral
polyps (Figure 34.2) also reproduce through fission.

Budding
Budding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a
separation from the original organism into two individuals. Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such
as corals and hydras. In hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as illustrated
in Figure 34.3, whereas i
