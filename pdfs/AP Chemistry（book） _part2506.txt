equired for a metal 
object immersed in water to corrode, the ability of an aquatic environ-
ment to support fish and plant life, the fate of pollutants washed out of 
the air by rain, and even the rates of reactions that maintain our lives 
all critically depend on the acidity or basicity of solutions. We will thus 
explore in this chapter how we measure acidity and how the chemical 
reactions of acids and bases depend on their concentrations.
We first encountered acids and bases in Sections 2.8 and 4.3, in 
which we discussed the naming of acids and some simple acidâ€“base re-
actions, respectively. In this chapter we take a closer look at how acids 
and bases are identified and characterized. In doing so, we consider their 
behavior both in terms of their structure and bonding and in terms of 
the chemical equilibria in which they participate.

Acids and bases are common both 
 
in nature and in the laboratory. Citric acid and 
ascorbic acid (also known as Vitamin C) are what
