 is good for passing the time when you’re by yourself in a 
 
 typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives 
 
 him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops 
 
 mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling 
 
 Frankie you’re a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says,You’re a lovely man, 
 
  
  
 Seamus. He smiles because he’s an old man of forty and he never had 
 
 195 
 
 children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, 
 
 Here’s the book, Frankie. Isn’t it a great pity you have to be reading all 
 
 about England after all they did to us, that there isn’t a history of Ireland 
 
 to be had in this hospital. 
 
 The book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror 
 
 and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait 
 
 forever for his mother,Victoria, to die before he could be king. The 
 
 book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read. 
 
 I do believe,
