oran, this child is a time straddler, 
 
 born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it 
 
 her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New.You’ll have to write 
 
 to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I’ll 
 
 save this dress for next year. 
 
 And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the 
 
 midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because 
 
 she was a little angel anyway. 
 
 Love her as in childhood 
 
 Though feeble, old and grey.

 Till she’s buried beneath the clay. 
 
 At the St.Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write,

 her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat 
 
  
  
 opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required 
 
 and her mother said,You don’t have the knack of it.You’re pure
