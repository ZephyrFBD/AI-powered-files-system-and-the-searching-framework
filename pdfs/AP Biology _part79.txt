ry postulates that mitochondria
were once free-living prokaryotic cells that took up permanent residence
inside larger prokaryotic cells billions of years ago.
Vacuoles
Vacuoles are membrane-bound structures used for storage. They are large
vesicles derived from the ER and Golgi apparatus. Mature plant cells
generally have a single large central vacuole. Many freshwater protists
have contractile vacuoles to pump out excess water. Food vacuoles are
formed by the phagocytosis of foreign material.
Chloroplast
Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll that, along with
enzymes, absorbs light energy and synthesizes sugar. They are found in
plants and algae. In addition to a double outer membrane, they have
another inner membrane system called thylakoids. (See page 126 for
details.)
According to the theory of endosymbiosis, chloroplasts were once
tiny, free-living prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by a larger
prokaryotic cell. Eventually, the engulfed cell became a permanent
resid
