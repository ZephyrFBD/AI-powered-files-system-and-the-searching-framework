FIGURE 21–16 (a) Simplified schematic diagram of an alternator. The input current to the rotor from the battery is 
connected through continuous slip rings. Sometimes the rotor electromagnet is replaced by a permanent magnet (no input 
current). (b) Actual shape of an alternator. The rotor is made to turn by a belt from the engine. The current in the wire coil 
of the rotor produces a magnetic field inside it on its axis that points horizontally from left to ri
