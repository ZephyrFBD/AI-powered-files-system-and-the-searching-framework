ave pores on their surface called stomata that can open and shut to let water out or keep it in.
b. Explain how harsh environmental condition can change the phenotypes of a population over many
generations.
A harsh condition could cause some individuals to die or to be less likely to reproduce. If they do not reproduce, then
they don’t contribute their genes and traits to the next generation. Over time, if this happens many times, the genes of
the individuals that are less “fit” will become less and less and the phenotypes of the population will change.
c. Predict what might have led to the change in water preference for the sunflower population.
Something must have happened that caused the middle amount of water to be bad for the plants. Plants that liked
to live in the middle range of moisture were not reproducing as well. This might have been because there was a fungus or
an insect that also liked that moisture level and so the plants that lived in that level of moisture all died. T
