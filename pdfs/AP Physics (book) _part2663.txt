will be larger in Eq. 24–3a). This is
consistent with our study of waves in Chapter 11. The diffraction through the
rectangular hole will be wider vertically, since the opening is smaller in that
direction.
(b) For a stadium loudspeaker, the sound pattern desired is one spread out
horizontally, so the horn should be tall and narrow (rotate Fig. 24–23 by 90°).
