Yet another chemist will develop theory, write computer code, and 
run computer simulations to understand how molecules move and 
react. The collective chemical enterprise is a rich mix of all of these 
activities.

1.2 ∣ Classifications of Matter
Let’s begin our study of chemistry by examining two fundamental ways in which matter 
is classified. Matter is typically characterized by (1) its physical state (gas,  
liquid, or solid) 
and (2) its composition (whether it is an element, a compound, or a mixture
