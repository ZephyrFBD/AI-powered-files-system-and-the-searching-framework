At higher temperatures, there is more kinetic
energy and the increased rate of random collisions between molecules
increases the probability that they will collide in the right way to react.
Thus, (A) correctly characterizes this relationship. (B) is incorrect
because there is more kinetic energy at higher temperatures, not at
lower temperatures, and because increased kinetic energy actually
raises the likelihood that the substrate will bind to the enzyme. (C) is
incorrect because 30°C is actually a higher temperature than 37°C, so it
makes no sense to say that the protein “denatured due to excess
heat.” (D) is incorrect because substrate concentration remains
constant, according to the question stem.

Cofactors, which help catalyze reactions, are nonprotein (inorganic)
species that bind to enzymes. They may change the enzyme’s shape to
bind the substrate or they may stabilize the enzyme’s active
conformation. (C) appropriately illustrates a cofactor binding
