tances to diffuse through. (C) is incorrect since no protein pumps are involved in diffusion. (D) is
incorrect since while all human cells need oxygen, the diffusion efficiency is dependent on physical
size.
15. (C) is correct. LUCA is the common ancestor of all three domains. Thus, LUCA must have
characteristics of all three domains. The only cell part listed that is in each of the domains is
ribosomes.
16. (B) is correct. From the data it is clear that the bacteria on the meat with ascorbate have fewer
mutations than the meat without ascorbate. (A) is incorrect since it says that ascorbate causes
mutations. Choice (B) would result in fewer mutations, since mutations are caused by nitrosamines,
and inhibiting the enzyme that causes production of nitrosamines would reduce the amount of this
mutagen. (C) is incorrect because increasing the binding between the mutagen and DNA would
increase mutations. (D) is incorrect because it results in more gene expression rather than more or
fewer m
