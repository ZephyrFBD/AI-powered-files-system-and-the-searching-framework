ent makes the cavity less than
the atmosphere (Figure 30.16a). Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. To increase the
volume of the lungs, the chest wall expands. This results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles, the muscles that
are connected to the rib cage. Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract,
thus expanding the thoracic cavity. This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the
atmosphere, so air rushes into the lungs, thus increasing its volume. The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to
an increase in alveolar space, because the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.

Figure 30.16 The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration.
The chest wall expands out and away from the lungs. The lungs are elasti
