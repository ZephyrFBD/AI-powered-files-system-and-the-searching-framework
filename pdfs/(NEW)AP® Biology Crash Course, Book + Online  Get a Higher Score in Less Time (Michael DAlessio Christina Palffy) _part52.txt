 features to know about electron transport:
i.
Occurs in the mitochondria and is similar to the ETC of photosynthesis.
ii. NADH and FADH2 deliver electrons and pass them to a series of electron acceptors as these
electrons move toward the final electron acceptor, O2.
iii. This passage of electrons within the mitochondria is accompanied by a proton gradient that
facilitates the electronsâ€™ movement down the ETC.
iv. In the ETC, no direct ATP is made; it must be coupled to oxidative phosphorylation via
chemiosmosis (or the diffusion of H+ ions across the membrane).
Cellular respiration produces a total of 38 ATP.
III.
Fermentation
A. Glycolysis is the first step of both aerobic respiration and fermentation.
1. Two of the end products of glycolysis, pyruvic acid and NADH, can be processed anaerobically in the
cytoplasm of certain cells.
2. The second step of fermentation does not produce ATP directly.
3. Rather, it generates NAD+, which is required to keep glycolysis running and producing
