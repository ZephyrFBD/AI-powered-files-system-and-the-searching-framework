 of a tube is open to the atmosphere. Hence the pressure variation
at an open end must be a node: the pressure does not alternate, but remains at
the outside atmospheric pressure. If a tube has a closed end, the pressure at that
closed end can readily alternate to be above or below atmospheric pressure.
Hence there is a pressure antinodeat a closed end of a tube.There can be pressure nodes
and antinodes within the tube. Some of the possible vibrational modes in terms of
pressure are shown in Fig.12–11b for an open tube, and in Fig.12–12b for a closed tube.
