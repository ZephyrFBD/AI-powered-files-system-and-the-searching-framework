d investigation, students 
manipulate data using a computer spreadsheet to build their own mathematical models 
derived from H-W to investigate allele inheritance patterns in a theoretically infinite 
population with inherent randomness. Students should begin this investigation after 
they have studied Mendelian genetics and have a solid understanding of alleles and 
genes, perhaps just as they start studying evolution.

In  Investigation 3: Comparing DNA Sequences to Understand 
Evolutionary Relationships with BLAST,  students use BLAST (Basic 
Local Alignment Search Tool) to compare several genes from different organisms, and 
then use the information to construct a cladogram (i.e., phylogenetic tree) to visualize 
evolutionary relatedness among species. The field of bioinformatics merges statistics, 
mathematical modeling, and computer science to analyze biological data; entire genomes 
can be compared quickly to detect genetic similarities and dif
