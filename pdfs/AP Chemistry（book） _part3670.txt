+2 + 4(0) = +2
[Cu(NH3)4]2+
Recall that the number of atoms directly bonded to the metal atom in a complex is 
the coordination number of the complex. Thus, the silver ion in 3Ag(NH3)24+ has a coordi-
nation number of 2, and the cobalt ion has a coordination number of 6 in all four com-
plexes in Table 23.3.
Some metal ions have only one observed coordination number. The coordination 
number of chromium(III) and cobalt(III) is invariably 6, for example, and that of plati-
num(II) is always 4. For most metals, however, the coordination number is different for dif-
ferent ligands. In these complexes, the most common coordination numbers are 4 and 6.
The coordination number of a metal ion is often influenced by the relative sizes of 
the metal ion and the ligands. As the ligand gets larger, fewer of them can coordinate 
to the metal ion. Thus, iron(III) is able to coordinate to six fluorides in 3FeF643- but to
