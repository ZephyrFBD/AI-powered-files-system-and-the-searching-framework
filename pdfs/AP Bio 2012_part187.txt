species becomes locally extinct. 
• 
Reduction in genetic variability due to loss of infected plants. 
• 
Change in allele frequencies for the affected species.
• 
Loss of consumer species dependent on affected prairie grass species.
• 
Members of the affected species with a genotype conferring resistance 
become more common, leading to no long-term effects to the population 
or community.
• 
Grass is replaced by other species — community is stabilized, or some 
changes in members of the food chain.
• 
Increased erosion due to lack of grass leading to degradation of abiotic 
environment, further limiting the ability of the environment to support  
the community.
