Bulb in RC circuit. In the circuit of 
Fig. 19–22, the capacitor is originally uncharged. Describe the behavior of the
lightbulb from the instant switch S is closed until a long time later.
RESPONSE When the switch is first closed, the current in the circuit is high and
the lightbulb burns brightly. As the capacitor charges, the voltage across the capac-
itor increases, causing the current to be reduced, and the lightbulb dims. As 
the potential difference across the capacitor approaches the same voltage as the
battery, the current decreases toward zero and the lightbulb goes out.

Medical and Other Applications of RC Circuits
The charging and discharging in an RC circuit can be used to produce voltage
pulses at a regular frequency. The charge on the capacitor increases to a particular
voltage, and then dis
