Tomographic Image Reconstruction
How can the “grayness” of each pixel be determined even though all we can
measure is the total absorption along each beam line in the slice? It can be done
only by using the many beam scans made at a great many different angles. Sup-
pose the image is to be an array of 
elements for a total of 
pixels.
If we have 100 detectors and measure the absorption projections at 100 different
angles, then we get 
pieces of information. From this information, an image can
be reconstructed, but not precisely. If more angles are measured, the reconstruction
of the image can be done more accurately.

Rays transmitted through the entire 
body are measured simultaneously at
each angle. The source and detector
rotate to take measurements at different
angles. In another type of fan-be
