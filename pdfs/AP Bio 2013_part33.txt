16. The vertebrate forelimb initially develops in the 
embryo as a solid mass of tissue. As development 
progresses, the solid mass near the end of the 
forelimb is remodeled into individual digits. 
Which of the following best explains the role  
of apoptosis in remodeling of the forelimb? 
(A) Apoptosis replaces old cells with new ones 
that are less likely to contain mutations. 
(B) Apoptosis involves the regulated activation 
of proteins in specific cells of the 
developing forelimb that leads to the death 
of those cells. 
(C) Apoptosis involves the destruction of extra 
cells in the developing forelimb, which 
provides nutrients for phagocytic cells. 
(D) Apoptosis in the developing forelimb triggers 
the differentiation of cells whose fate was 
not already determined.
