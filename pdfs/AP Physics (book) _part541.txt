in Fig. 5–37. If the power to the
turntable is turned off, which arrow
best represents the direction of the
acceleration of the penny at point P
while the turntable is still spinning
but slowing down?
5;1 to 5;3 Uniform Circular Motion
1. (I) A child sitting 1.20 m from the center of a merry-go-
round moves with a speed of 
Calculate (a) the
centripetal acceleration of the child and (b) the net hori-
zontal force exerted on the child
2. (I) A jet plane traveling 
pulls out of 
a dive by moving in an arc of radius 5.20 km. What is the
plane’s acceleration in g’s?
3. (I) A horizontal force of 310 N is exerted on a 2.0-kg ball
as it rotates (at arm’s length) uniformly in a horizontal circle
of radius 0.90 m. Calculate the speed of the ball.
4. (II) What is the magnitude of the acceleration of a speck 
of clay on the edge of a potter’s wheel turning at 45 rpm
(revolutions per minute) if the wheel’s diameter is 35 cm?
5. (II) A 0.55-kg ball, attached to the end of a horizontal
cord, is r
