vioral isolation. Another example of behavioral isolation is the mating dance.
(c) The data are inconclusive because the 95% confidence intervals for the bird songs of 120–299 seconds and
300–480 seconds overlap. Therefore, there does not appear to be a statistically significant difference
between the two groups.
(d) There is a large increase in the number of female birds that approach males with bird songs 120 seconds or
longer (compared to those with songs that are less than 120 seconds). However, there does not appear to be
a difference between the number of females approaching males with songs that are 120–299 seconds long
and males with songs that are 300–480 seconds long. Therefore, it is unlikely that birds with songs longer
than 480 seconds will attract significantly more females. Thus, a reasonable prediction would be that a song
longer than eight minutes (480 seconds) would not attract significantly more female birds than songs that
were 120–480 seconds long.
