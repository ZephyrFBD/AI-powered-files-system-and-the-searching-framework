onic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the osmolarity of the cell matches that
of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell, although water will still move in and
out. Blood cells and plant cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances (Figure
5.12).

Explain the difference between the two beakers (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dispersion) .
a.
The lower temperature of left beaker causes yellow dye to diffuse faster than the right beaker.
b.
The lower temperature in left beaker causes yellow dye to diffuse slower in it than in the right beaker.
c.
The higher temperature of left beaker causes f
