 eggs into the water. However, the sperm from red sea urchins cannot
fertilize the eggs from purple sea urchins. Which type of reproductive isolation is this?
(A) mechanical isolation

37. A template strand of DNA has the following sequence:
What is the complementary strand created during DNA replication?
(A) 3′-TTA AGG CCT AGC-5′
(B) 5′-TTA AGG CCT AGC-3′
(C) 3′-UUA AGG CCU AGC-5′
(D) 5′-UUA AGG CCU AGC-3′
38. Which of the following statements best explains the mechanism for DNA replication?
(A) DNA replication is reductive, because half of the total DNA present is copied.
(B) DNA replication is semiconservative, because each DNA strand serves as a template for a new strand
during replication.
(C) DNA replication is dispersive, because the two resulting DNA molecules are random mixtures of parent
and daughter DNA.
(D) DNA replication is conservative, because one resulting molecule is identical to the original and t
