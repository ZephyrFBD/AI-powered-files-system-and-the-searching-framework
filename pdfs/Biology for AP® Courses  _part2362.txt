s can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause
productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic
infection.
In hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is
so low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine
blood work on patients with risk factors. On the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by
immune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus. This allows for the virus to
escape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny
virions in what is known as a chronic viral disease.
As already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years. As
