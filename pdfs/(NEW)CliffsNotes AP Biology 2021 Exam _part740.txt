e time, you cannot determine which is responsible for the effect you measure in
the dependent variable.
In the physiological experiment, if the subject also drinks coffee in addition to exercising, you cannot determine
which treatment, coffee or exercise, causes a change in blood pressure.
5. Random sample of subjects. You must choose the subjects for your experiments randomly. Since you cannot
evaluate every Daphnia, you must choose a sample population to study. If you choose only the largest Daphnia to
study, it is not a random sample, and you introduce another variable (size) for which you cannot account.
6. Describe the procedure. Describe how you will set up the experiment. Identify equipment and chemicals to be
used and why you are choosing to use them. If appropriate, provide a labeled drawing of the setup.
7. Describe expected results. Use graphs to illustrate the expected results, if appropriate.
8. Provide an explanation of the expected results in relation to relevant biologi
