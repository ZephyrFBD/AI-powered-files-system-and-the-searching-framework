 or too few chromosomes due to nondisjunction
during meiosis. In the example shown here, the resulting offspring will have 2n+1 or 2n-1 chromosomes
In your own words, define aneuploidy.
a.
Aneuploidy is a mutation that causes the genome of a cell to break down.
b.
neuploidy is the condition of having too many or too few chromosomes as a result of an error during cell
division
c.
Aneuploidy is the condition of having an extra copy of every chromosome in the genome.
d.
Aneuploidy is a prezygotic barrier in which the gametes of two distinct species will not fertilize each other.
Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified
two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. Reproductive
isolation is the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of
chromosomes from its own species in a condition ca
