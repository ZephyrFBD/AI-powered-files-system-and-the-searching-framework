to distinguish it from rotational kinetic
energy, which we will discuss in Chapter 8.) Equation 6–2, derived here for one-
dimensional motion with a constant force, is valid in general for translational
motion of an object in three dimensions and even if the force varies.
We can rewrite Eq. 6–2 as:
or
(6;4)
Equation 6–4 is a useful result known as the work-energy principle. It can be
stated in words:
The net work done on an object is equal to the change in the object’s 
kinetic energy.
Notice that we made use of Newton’s second law,
where 
is the net
force—the sum of all forces acting on the object. Thus, the work-energy principle
is valid only if W is the net work done on the object—that is, the work done by 
all forces acting on the object.
