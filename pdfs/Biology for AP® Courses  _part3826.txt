What are the differences in the ways aquatic animals and terrestrial animals can eliminate toxic ammonia from
their systems?

What are the major byproducts of ammonia metabolism in mammals compared to fish, reptiles, birds, and insects?
Connection for AP® Courses
Much information in this section is outside the scope for AP®. However, the concepts provide an opportunity to apply
concepts explored in previous chapters, including chemistry. Of the four macromolecules in biological systems, both
proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen. During the breakdown (catabolism) of nitrogen-containing macromolecules,
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in the form of carbohydrates and fats. However, excess nitrogen
must be excreted from the body because nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia, which raises the pH of body
fluids and disrupts homeostasis. The formation of toxic ammonia requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities
of water to dilute it out
