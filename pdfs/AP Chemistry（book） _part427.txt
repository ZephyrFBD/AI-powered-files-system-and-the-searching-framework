d this number to be 6.0221415 * 1023, which 
we usually round to 6.02 * 1023. Scientists call this value Avogadro’s number, NA, in 
honor of the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856), and it is often cited with 
units of reciprocal moles, 6.02 * 1023 mol-1.* The unit (read as either “inverse mole” 
or “per mole”) reminds us that there are 6.02 * 1023 objects per one mole. A mole of 
atoms, a mole of molecules, or a mole of anything else all contain Avogadro’s number 
of objects:
 1 mol 12C atoms = 6.02 * 1023 12C atoms 
 1 mol H2O molecules = 6.02 * 1023 H2O molecules 
 1 mol NO3
- ions = 6.02 * 1023 NO3
- ions
Avogadro’s number is so large that it is difficult to imagine. Spreading 6.02 * 1023 
 
marbles over Earth’s surface would produce a layer about 3 miles thick. Avogadro’s num-
ber of pennies placed side by side in a straight line would encircle Earth 300 trillion 
13 * 10142 times.
