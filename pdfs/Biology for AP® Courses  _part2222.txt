sts historically organized Earth’s millions of species into a hierarchical taxonomic classification system from the
most inclusive category to the most specific: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The
traditional five-kingdom system that you might have studied in middle school was expanded (and reorganized) to include
three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, with prokaryotes divided between Bacteria or Archaea depending on their
molecular genetic machinery, and protists, fungi, plants, and animals grouped in Eukarya. Today, however, phylogenetic
trees provide more specific information about evolutionary history and relationships among organisms. (For the purpose of
AP®, you do not have to memorize the taxonomic levels. However, it is important to reiterate that taxonomy is a tool to
organize the millions of organisms on Earth, similar to how items in a grocery store or mall shop are organized into different
departments. Like new products, organisms
