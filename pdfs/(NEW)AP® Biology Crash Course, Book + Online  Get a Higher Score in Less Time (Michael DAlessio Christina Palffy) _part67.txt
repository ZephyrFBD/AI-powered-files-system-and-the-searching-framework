naling—neurotransmitters diffuse across a synapse to a single cell
C. The three stages of cell signaling are reception, transduction, and response.
1. Reception—chemical signals bind to cellular protein.
2. Transduction—binding leads to a change along a signal transduction pathway.
3. Response—a specific cellular activity is triggered.
D. Signal Transduction Pathway—the process by which a signal on the cell’s surface is converted to a
specific cellular response—is strikingly similar in yeast and animal cells. Their evolutionary similarities
in cell communication still exist today, despite the fact that the common ancestor of yeast and animals
lived more than one billion years ago. Even signaling between bacteria and plants is similar in some ways.

Local and Long-Distance Signals
A. Communication between cells involving chemical messengers can be local or long distance.
1. Local regulators are secreted by cells and only affect the activity of nearby cells.
