nergy to reach
the conduction band, and so a very small current may flow when a voltage is
applied. At higher temperatures, more electrons have enough energy to jump the
gap (top end of thermal distribution—see Fig. 13–20). Often this effect can more
than offset the effects of more frequent collisions due to increased disorder at
higher temperature, so the resistivity of semiconductors can decrease with increas-
ing temperature (see Table 18–1). But this is not the whole story of semiconductor
conduction. When a potential difference is applied to a semiconductor, the few
electrons in the conduction band move toward the positive electrode. Electrons
in the valence band try to do the same thing, and a few can because there are 
a small number of unoccupied states which were left empty by the electrons
reaching the conduction band. Such unfilled electron states are called holes.
Each electron in the valence band that fills a hole in this way as it moves toward
the positive electrode leave
