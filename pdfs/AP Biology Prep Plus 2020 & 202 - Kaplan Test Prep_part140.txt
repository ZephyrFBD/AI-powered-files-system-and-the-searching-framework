The area between the inner and outer membranes is known as the
intermembrane space. The inner membrane has many convolutions
called cristae, as well as a high protein content that includes the proteins
of the electron transport chain. The area bounded by the inner
membrane is known as the mitochondrial matrix and is the site of many
of the reactions in cellular respiration, including electron transport, the
Krebs cycle, and ATP production.
Mitochondria are somewhat unusual in that they are semiautonomous
within the cell. They contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes,
which enable them to produce some of their own proteins. The genome
and ribosomes of mitochondria resemble those of prokaryotes more than
eukaryotes. In addition, they are able to self-replicate through binary
fission. Mitochondria are believed to have developed from early
prokaryotic cells that began a symbiotic relationship with the ancestors
of eukaryotes, with the mitochondria providing energy and the host cell
