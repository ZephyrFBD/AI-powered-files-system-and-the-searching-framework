to remember: reactions are also influenced by whether the solution in which they occur is acidic, basic, or neutral.
What makes a solution acidic or basic? A solution is acidic if it contains a lot of hydrogen ions (H+). That is, if you
dissolve an acid in water, it will release a lot of hydrogen ions. When you think about acids, you usually think of
substances with a sour taste, like lemons. For example, if you squeeze a little lemon juice into a glass of water, the
solution will become acidic. That’s because lemons contain citric acid, which releases a lot of H+ into the solution.
Bases, on the other hand, do not release hydrogen ions when added to water. They release a lot of hydroxide ions
(OH–). These solutions are said to be alkaline (the fancy name for a basic solution). Bases usually have a slippery
consistency. Common soap, for example, is composed largely of bases.
