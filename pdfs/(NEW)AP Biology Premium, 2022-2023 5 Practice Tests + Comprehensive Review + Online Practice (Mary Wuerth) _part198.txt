role of photosynthetic algae in ecosystems.
(b) Explain why kleptoplasty would give Elysia crispata a survival advantage.
(c) An oil spill on the surface of the water reduces the intensity of light in Elysia crispata’s habitat. Predict the
effect this would have on Elysia crispata’s survival.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c).
12. The light-dependent and light-independent reactions of photosynthesis exchange materials and are
interdependent, as shown in the following figure.
(a) Identify the molecules the light-dependent reactions provide to the light-independent reactions. Label
arrow 1 with those molecules.
(b) Identify the molecules the light-independent reactions return to the light-dependent reactions. Label arrow
2 with those molecules.
(c) An inhibitor of the enzyme Rubisco is added to a plant cell. Explain which part of photosynthesis would
be most directly affected by this inhibitor.
(d) A student claims that the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis would stop
