ysiologically inhibited from
undergoing any division and remain in the G0
phase to provide assistance to their neighboring
cells.
b.
Some cells reproduce only under certain
conditions and, until then, they remain in the
G0 phase.
c.
Suspected DNA damage can lead the cell to
undergo the G0 phase.
d.
The lack of important components of cell
division makes cells stay in the G0 phase.
27. Describe the general conditions that must be met at
each of the three main cell cycle checkpoints.
a.
G1 checkpoint - assessment of DNA damage,
G2 - assessment of new DNA, M checkpoint -
segregation of sister chromatids in anaphase.
b.
G1 checkpoint - Energy reserves for s phase,
G2 checkpoint - assessment of new DNA, M
checkpoint- attachment of spindle to
kinetochore.
c.
G1 checkpoint - assessment of DNA damage,
G2 checkpoint - energy reserves for
duplication, M checkpoint - attachment of
spindle to kinetochore
d.
G1 checkpoint - Energy reserves for S-phase, S
checkpoint - synthesis of DNA, G2 checkpoint
