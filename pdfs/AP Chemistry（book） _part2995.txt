on of table salt, NaCl, into sodium and chlorine 
is nonspontaneous under ordinary conditions, it is possible to decompose molten NaCl 
by supplying energy from an external source. A spontaneous process occurs without 
such outside intervention.
Predict whether each process is spontaneous as described, spontaneous in the reverse direction, or at equilibrium: (a) Water at 
40 °C gets hotter when a piece of metal heated to 150 °C is added. (b) Water at room temperature decomposes into H21g2 and 
O21g2. (c) Benzene vapor, C6H61g2, at a pressure of 1 atm condenses to liquid benzene at the normal boiling point of benzene, 
80.1 °C.
Sample Exercise 19.1 
Identifying Spontaneous Processes
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to judge whether each process is sponta-
neous in the direction indicated, in the reverse direction, or in 
neither direction.
Plan We need to think about whether each process is consistent 
with our experience about the natural direction of events or 
whether we expect the reve
