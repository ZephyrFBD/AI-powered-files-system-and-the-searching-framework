2a). If, on the other hand, the person
walks 8 km east on the first day, and 6 km west (in the reverse direction) on the
second day, then the person will end up 2 km from the origin (Fig. 3–2b), so the
resultant displacement is 2 km to the east. In this case, the resultant displacement
is obtained by subtraction:
But simple arithmetic cannot be used if the two vectors are not along the same
line. For example, suppose a person walks 10.0 km east and then walks 5.0 km
north. These displacements can be represented on a graph in which the positive 
y axis points north and the positive x axis points east, Fig. 3–3. On this graph, we
draw an arrow, labeled 
to represent the 10.0-km displacement to the east.
Then we draw a second arrow,
to represent the 5.0-km displacement to 
the north. Both vectors are drawn to scale, as in Fig. 3–3.
