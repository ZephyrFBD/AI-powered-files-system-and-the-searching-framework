hree quarks,
one of each color. Mesons consist of a quark–antiquark pair of a particular color
and its anticolor. Both baryons and mesons are thus colorless or white.
Originally, the idea of quark color was proposed to preserve the Pauli exclu-
sion principle (Section 28–7). Not all particles obey the exclusion principle.
Those that do, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, are called fermions.
Those that don’t are called bosons. These two categories are distinguished also 
in their spin: bosons have integer spin (0, 1, 2, etc.) whereas fermions have 
half-integer spin, usually 
as for electrons and nucleons, but other fermions 
have spin 
etc. Matter is made up mainly of fermions, but the carriers of 
the forces (
W, Z, and gluons) are all bosons. Quarks are fermions (they have 
spin ) and therefore should obey the exclusion principle. Yet for three particular
baryons (uuu, ddd, and sss), all three quarks would have the same quantum
numbers, and at least two quarks have their spin
