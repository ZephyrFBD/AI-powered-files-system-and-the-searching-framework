ssed by Henry’s law: Sg = kP
g. The sol-
ubilities of most solid solutes in water increase as the temperature of 
the solution increases. In contrast, the solubilities of gases in water 
generally decrease with increasing temperature.
EXPRESSING SOLUTION CONCENTRATIONS (SECTION 13.4)  
Concentrations of solutions can be expressed quantitatively by sev-
eral different measures, including mass percentage [(mass solute/mass 
solution) * 100] parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), and 
mole fraction. Molarity, M, is defined as moles of solute per liter of 
solution; molality, m, is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of sol-
vent. Molarity can be converted to these other concentration units if 
the density of the solution is known.
COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES (SECTION 13.5) A physical property of 
a solution that depends on the concentration of solute particles pres-
ent, regardless of the nature of the solute, is a colligative property. Col-
ligative properties include vapor–pre
