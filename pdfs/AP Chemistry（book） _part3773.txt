CHAPTER 23 Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
 23.53  (a) Sketch a diagram that shows the definition of the crystal- 
field splitting energy (∆) for an octahedral crystal-field. (b) 
What is the relationship between the magnitude of ∆ and 
the energy of the d-d transition for a d1 complex? (c) Cal-
culate ∆ in kJ>mol if a d1 complex has an absorption max-
imum at 545 nm.
 23.54  As shown in Figure 23.26, the d-d transition of 3Ti(H2O)643+ 
produces an absorption maximum at a wavelength 
of about 500 nm. (a) What is the magnitude of ∆ for 
3Ti(H2O)643+ in kJ>mol? (b) How would the magnitude of 
∆ change if the H2O ligands in 3Ti(H2O)643+ were replaced 
with NH3 ligands?

which is green and has an empirical formula of Cu2CO3
