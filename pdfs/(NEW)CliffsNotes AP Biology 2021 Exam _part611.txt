 that control gene expression follow (see also the section “Regulation of
Gene Expression” in Chapter 9, “Molecular Biology”):
1. Methylation occurs when enzymes attach methyl groups to the histone proteins that package DNA into compact
coils. The methyl groups cause the histone packaging to hold the DNA more tightly, preventing the DNA from
uncoiling and being expressed. Methylation occurs during embryonic development and specific sequences of
methylated DNA are maintained in cell lines. Thus, once methylation occurs, the fate of a cell line is determined.
Errors in DNA methylation have been observed in cancer cells.
2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small segments of RNA (usually about 20 nucleotides long) that influence the
expression of genes and subsequent development. After attaching to a protein, the miRNA-protein complex binds to
an mRNA, where the RNA nucleotide sequences are complementary. Then, translation of the mRNA is blocked,
either by preventing the ribosome from attaching or b
