 to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom.The 
 
 priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a 
 
 regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened 
 
 Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child 
 
 some class of a Protestant.The priest said, Quiet, man, you’re in God’s 
 
 house, and when Malachy said, God’s house, my arse, he was thrown 
 
 out on Court Street because you can’t say arse in God’s house. 
 
 After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her 
 
  
  
 house around the corner.Malachy said,Tea? and she said,Yes, tea, or is 
 
 it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he’d have to go and 
 
 deal with John McErlaine, who didn’t have the decency to carry out 
 
 his duties as godfather. Angela said,You’re only looking for an excuse 
 
 to run to the speakeasy, and he said,As God is my witness, the drink is 
 
 the last thing on my mind
