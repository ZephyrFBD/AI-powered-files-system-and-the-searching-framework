l or become turgid. This turgid
pressure is what keeps plants like celery crisp. If a plant loses too much
water (dehydrates), it loses its turgor pressure and wilts.

Example 3: The cell in Figure 3.15 is in a hypertonic solution. The
concentration of solute in the beaker is greater than the concentration of
solute in the cell. Therefore, water will flow out of the cell because water
flows from high concentration of water to low concentration of water. As a
result, the cell shrinks, exhibiting plasmolysis.

Aquaporins are special water channel proteins found in certain cells
that facilitate the diffusion of massive amounts of water across a cell
membrane, up to 3 billion (3 Ã— 109) water molecules per second. These
channels do not affect the water potential gradient or the direction of water
flow but, rather, the rate at which water diffuses down its gradient. It is
