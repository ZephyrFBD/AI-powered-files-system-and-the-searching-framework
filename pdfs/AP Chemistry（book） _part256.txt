▶ Figure 2.1 Dalton’s atomic theory.* John 
Dalton (1766–1844), the son of a poor 
English weaver, began teaching at age 12. 
He spent most of his years in Manchester, 
where he taught both grammar school and 
college. His lifelong interest in meteorology 
led him to study gases, then chemistry, 
and eventually atomic theory. Despite his 
humble beginnings, Dalton gained a strong 
scientific reputation during his lifetime.
A good theory explains known facts; Dalton’s theory explained several laws of 
chemical combination known at the time.
t 
5IFlaw of constant composition 
(Section 1.2 ),** based on  
postulate 4:
In a given compound, the relative numbers and kinds of atoms are constant.

5IFlaw of conservation of mass, based on postulate 3:
The total mass of materials present after a chemical reaction is the same as the total 
mass present before the reaction.
