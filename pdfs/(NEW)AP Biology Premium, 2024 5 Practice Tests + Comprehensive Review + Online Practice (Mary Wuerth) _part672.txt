vent the meeting of gametes, so choice (D) is incorrect.
36. (B) Gametic isolation occurs when the gametes of different species are incompatible, leading to reproductive
isolation. Choice (A) is incorrect because mechanical isolation occurs when morphological differences prevent
the meeting of gametes. Since both species of sea urchins can release their gametes into the water and their
gametes can come into contact, there is no mechanical isolation in this instance. Reduced hybrid fertility occurs
when a hybrid of the two organisms is produced but that hybrid is sterile, so choice (C) is incorrect. Choice (D)
is incorrect because hybrid breakdown occurs when a fertile hybrid is produced but with each successive
generation, the offspring of the hybrid are weaker or less fertile.
37. (B) The two strands of DNA are antiparallel, so the new strand would start with a 5â€² end. Following the pairing
rules for DNA (A-T and C-G), this leaves choice (B) as the correct answer. Choice (A) is incorr
