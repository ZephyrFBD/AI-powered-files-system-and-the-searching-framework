with greatest
entropy, or greatest disorder and randomness. The processes we actually observe
are those where the entropy increase is greatest.
In terms of probability, the second law of thermodynamics—which tells us
that entropy increases in any process—reduces to the statement that those
processes occur which are most probable.
There is an additional element, however. The second law in terms of prob-
ability does not forbid a decrease in entropy. Rather, it says the probability 
is extremely low. It is not impossible that salt and pepper could separate 
spontaneously into layers, or that a broken cup could mend itself (Fig. 15–10). It is
even possible that a lake could freeze over on a hot summer day (that is, for heat
to flow out of the cold lake into the warmer surroundings). But the probability for
such events occurring is almost always miniscule. In our coin examples, we saw
that increasing the number of coins from 4 to 100 drastically reduced the proba-
bility of large deviation
