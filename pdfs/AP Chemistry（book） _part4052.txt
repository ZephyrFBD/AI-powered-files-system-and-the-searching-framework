f pressure. At conditions beyond the critical point, a sub-
stance is known as a supercritical ﬂuid. 11.59 (a) H2O(g) will con-
dense to H2O(s) at approximately 4 torr; at a higher pressure, perhaps 
5 atm or so, H2O(s) will melt to form H2O(l). (b) At 100 °C and 0.50 
atm, water is in the vapor phase. As it cools, water vapor condenses to 
the liquid at approximately 82 °C, the temperature where the vapor 
pressure of liquid water is 0.50 atm. Further cooling results in freez-
ing at approximately 0 °C. The freezing point of water increases with 
decreasing pressure, so at 0.50 atm the freezing temperature is very 
slightly above 0 °C. 11.61 (a) 24 K (b) Neon sublimes at pressures 
less than the triple point pressure, approximately 0.5 atm. (c) No  
11.63 (a) Methane on the surface of Titan is likely to exist in both 
solid and liquid forms. (b) As pressure decreases upon moving away 
from the surface of Titan, CH4(l) (at -178 °C) will vaporize to CH4(g), 
and CH4(s) (at temperatures
