FIGURE 23–2 Law of reflection:
(a) shows a 3-D view of an incident
ray being reflected at the top of a
flat surface; (b) shows a side or
“end-on” view, which we will usually
use because of its clarity.
When a narrow beam of light strikes a flat surface (Fig. 23–2), we define the
angle of incidence,
to be the angle an incident ray makes with the normal
(perpendicular) to the surface, and the angle of reflection,
to be the angle the
reflected ray makes with the normal. It is found that the incident and reflected rays
lie in the same plane with the normal to the surface, and that
the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence,
This is the law of reflection, and it is depicted in Fig. 23–2. It was known to the
ancient Greeks, and you can confi
