 the Lewis structure for the polyatomic oxyanion 
shown here, where X is an element from the third period 
1Na - Ar2. By changing the overall charge, n, from 1- to 
2- to 3- we get three different polyatomic ions. For each of 
these ions (a) identify the central atom, X; (b) determine the 
formal charge of the central atom, X; (c) draw a Lewis struc-
ture that makes the formal charge on the central atom equal 
to zero. [Sections 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7]
 
8.4 The orbital diagram that follows shows the valence elec-
trons for a 2+ ion of an element. (a) What is the element? 
(b) What is the electron configuration of an atom of this ele-
ment? [Section 8.2]

8.5 In the Lewis structure shown here, A, D, E, Q, X, and Z rep-
resent elements in the first two rows of the periodic table. 
Identify all six elements so that the formal charges of all at-
oms are zero. [Section 8.3]
