e either the rate of 
disappearance of HI or the rate of appearance of either H2 or I2. Because 2 mol of HI dis-
appears for each mole of H2 or I2 that forms, the rate of disappearance of HI is twice the 
rate of appearance of either H2 or I2. How do we decide which number to use for the rate 
of the reaction? Depending on whether we monitor HI, I2, or H2, the rates can differ by a 
factor of 2. To fix this problem, we need to take into account the reaction stoichiometry. 
To arrive at a number for the reaction rate that does not depend on which component 
we measured, we must divide the rate of disappearance of HI by 2 (its coefficient in the 
balanced chemical equation):
 
Rate = -1

In general, for the reaction

the rate is given by
 
Rate = - 1

Using Figure 14.3, calculate the instantaneous rate of disappearance of C4H9Cl at t = 0 s (the initial rate).
