2.6.3 Common Logarithms 
 
87 
The logarithm with base 10 is called the common logarithm and is denoted by omitting 
the base: 
log x = log10 x 
From the definition of logarithms we can easily find that log 10 = 1 and log 100 = 2. 
But how do we find log 50? We need to find the exponent y such that 10y =50. 
Clearly, 1 is too small and 2 is too large. So 1 < log 50 < 2 
To get a better approximation, we can experiment to find a power of 10 closer to 50. 
LOG
Fortunately, scientific calculators are equipped with a 
 key that directly gives values 
of common logarithms. 
 
Example 3 
Use a calculator to find appropriate values of f (x) = log x, and use the values to sketch the 
graph.
