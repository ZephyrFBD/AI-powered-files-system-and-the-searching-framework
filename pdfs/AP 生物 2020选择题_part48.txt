A researcher collected DNA from several members of the family and used PCR to amplify the FXN genes from 
each individual’s DNA. The researcher then used DNA gel electrophoresis to separate the DNA. The results are 
shown in Figure 2.

lengths was used for comparison.

The researcher also used a computer to model the structure of the mutant FXN allele. The model suggests that the 
repeated GAA triplets in the mutant FXN gene may lead to the formation of an unusual triple-stranded 
configuration of DNA (Figure 3).
