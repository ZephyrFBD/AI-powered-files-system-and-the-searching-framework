solvent–solvent interactions between H2O molecules. When NaCl is added to water 
 
Give It Some Thought
If you put a drop of food coloring in water and watch the drop disperse, is entropy 
increasing or decreasing?
Go Figure
Which atom in water points toward Na + in the ion–dipole interaction? Why?

between the ions and water molecules. Sodium chloride does not dissolve in gasoline, 
however, because the intermolecular forces between the ions and the gasoline molecules 
are too weak.

CHAPTER 13 Properties of Solutions
(Figure 13.3), the water molecules orient themselves on the surface of the NaCl crystals 
with the positive end of the water dipole oriented toward Cl- ions an
