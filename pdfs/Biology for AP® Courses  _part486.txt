en the pores (“doughnut holes”) of connexons in adjacent animal
cells align, a channel between the two cells forms. Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: The electrical
signal for the muscle to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in
tandem.

What are two similarities and two differences between plant and animal cells that can be seen under a microscope?
a.
Plant cells have cell walls which provide structure to the plant and also chloroplasts which allow for
photosynthesis. Animal cells do not have either of these structures. Both cells have nuclei, the command
center of the cell, and cytoplasm, the gel-like solution that fills the cell.
b.
Plant cells and animal cells have cell walls as well as nuclei. Plan
