MOLECULAR SHAPES (INTRODUCTION AND SECTION 9.1) The 
three-dimensional shapes and sizes of molecules are determined by 
their bond angles and bond lengths. Molecules with a central atom A 
surrounded by n atoms B, denoted ABn, adopt a number of different 
geometric shapes, depending on the value of n and on the particular 
atoms involved. In the overwhelming majority of cases, these geom-
etries are related to five basic shapes (linear, trigonal pyramidal, tetra-
hedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral).
THE VSEPR MODEL (SECTION 9.2) The valence-shell 
electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model rationalizes molecular ge-
ometries based on the repulsions between electron domains, which 
are regions about a central atom in which electrons are likely to 
be found. Bonding pairs of electrons, which are those involved in 
making bonds, a
