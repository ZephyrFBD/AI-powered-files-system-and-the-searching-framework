ctions involving proton capture and positron emission.
Most stars gradually cool and dim as the helium is converted 
to carbon and oxygen, ending their lives as white dwarfs, a phase in 
which stars become incredibly denseâ€”generally about one million 
times denser than the Sun. The extreme density of white dwarfs is 
accompanied by much higher tempera-
tures and pressures at the core, where a 
variety of fusion processes lead to syn-
thesis of the elements from neon to 
sulfur. These fusion reactions are col-
lectively called advanced burning.
Eventually, progressively heavier 
elements form at the core until it 
becomes predominantly 56Fe, as shown 
in Figure 21.22. Because this is such a 
stable nucleus, further fusion to heavier 
nuclei consumes energy rather than 
releasing it. When this happens, the 
fusion reactions that power the star 
diminish, and immense gravitational 
forces lead to a dramatic collapse called 
a supernova explosion. Neutron capture
