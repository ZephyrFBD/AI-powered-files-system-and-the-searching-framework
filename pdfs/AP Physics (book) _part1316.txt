ifferent wavelengths. The regularly spaced intensity changes
are called beats.
To see how beats arise, consider two equal-amplitude sound waves of frequency
and
respectively. In 1.00 s, the first source makes 50 vibra-
tions whereas the second makes 60. We now examine the waves at one point in
space equidistant from the two sources. The waveforms for each wave as a function
of time, at a fixed position, are shown on the top graph of Fig. 12–18; the red line
represents the 50-Hz wave, and the blue line represents the 60-Hz wave. The
lower graph in Fig. 12–18 shows the sum of the two waves as a function of time. At
time
the two waves are shown to be in phase and interfere constructively.
Because the two waves vibrate at different rates, at time 
they are
completely out of phase and interfere destructively. At
they are again
in phase and the resultant amplitude again is large. Thus the resultant amplitude
is large every 0.10 s and drops drastically in between. This rising and falling of t
