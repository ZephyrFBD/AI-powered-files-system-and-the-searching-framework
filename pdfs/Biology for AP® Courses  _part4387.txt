of their energy budget to growth and maintenance. The tree’s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the
competition for sunlight, the oak’s primary energy resource. Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large,
energy-rich seeds that use their energy reserve to become quickly established (K-selection).
In contrast, r-selected species have a large number of small offspring (hence their r designation (Table 36.2). This
strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments. Animals that are r-selected do not give long-term
parental care and the offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. Examples of r-selected species are marine
invertebrates, such as jellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (Figure 36.14b). Dandelions have small seeds that are
wind dispersed long distances. Many seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a
hospitable environment. Seeds that land in inhospitable enviro
