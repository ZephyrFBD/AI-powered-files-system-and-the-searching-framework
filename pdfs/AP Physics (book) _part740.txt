the center of gravity and the
center of mass, but for nearly all practical purposes, they are at the same point.†
It is often easier to determine the CM or CG of an extended object experimen-
tally rather than analytically. If an object is suspended from any point, it will swing
(Fig. 7–24) due to the force of gravity on it, unless it is placed so its CG lies on 
a vertical line directly below the point from which it is suspended. If the object is
two dimensional, or has a plane of symmetry, it need only be hung from two 
different pivot points and the respective vertical (plumb) lines drawn. Then the
center of gravity will be at the intersection of the two lines, as in Fig. 7–25. If 
the object doesn’t have a plane of symmetry, the CG with respect to the third dimen-
sion is found by suspending the object from at least three points whose plumb
lines do not lie in the same plane.
For symmetrically shaped objects such as uniform cylinders (wheels), spheres,
and rectangular solids, the C
