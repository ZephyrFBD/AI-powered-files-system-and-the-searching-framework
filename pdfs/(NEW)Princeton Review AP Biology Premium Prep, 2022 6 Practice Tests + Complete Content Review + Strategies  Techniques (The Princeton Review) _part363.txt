lions of identical copies of
genes within hours. The process of creating many copies of genes is known as amplification. PCR utilizes a
machine called a thermocycler to mimic the process of DNA replication, thereby creating many copies of genes.
Amplified DNA fragments have many practical uses. For example, they can be utilized to perform phylogenetic
analyses.
Transformation
Insulin, the protein hormone that lowers blood sugar levels, can now be made for medical purposes by bacteria. Yes,
bacteria can be induced to use the universal DNA code to transcribe and translate a human gene! The process of
giving bacteria foreign DNA is called transformation.
Not only has this laboratory technique been used to safely mass-produce important proteins used for medicine, such
as insulin, but it also plays an important role in the study of gene expression. A technique similar to transformation
is transfection, which is putting a plasmid into a eukaryotic cell, rather than a bacteria cell. This is a
