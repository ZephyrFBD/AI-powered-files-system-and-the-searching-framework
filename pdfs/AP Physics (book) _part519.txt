vitational attraction
of the Sun that keeps each planet in its orbit. The period 
of the planet is the
time required for one complete orbit, which is a distance equal to 
the circum-
ference of a circle. Thus
We substitute this formula for 
into the previous equation:
We rearrange this to get
(5;7a)
We derived this for planet 1 (say, Mars). The same derivation would apply for a
second planet (say, Saturn) orbiting the Sun,
where 
and 
are the period and orbit radius, respectively, for the second
planet. Since the right sides of the two previous equations are equal, we have
or, rearranging,
(5;7b)
which is Kepler’s third law. Equations 5–7a and 5–7b are valid also for elliptical
orbits if we replace r with the semimajor axis s.
