ntibiotics.
If no growth occurred on that plate after bacteria that did not receive the plasmid were plated upon it, that
would confirm there was no previous antibiotic resistance.
(c) Not every bacterium is expected to absorb the plasmid. So far fewer bacteria colonies would be expected on
plate #4 (which contains ampicillin and tetracycline) than on plate #3 (which does not contain any
antibiotic). All bacteria, regardless of whether they absorbed the plasmid, would grow on the LB agar in
plate #3, while only bacteria that absorbed the plasmid could grow on plate #4. Based on what is shown in
the figure, the relative numbers of bacteria colonies on these two plates meets expectations, and thus this
bacterial transformation procedure was successful.
(d) The bacteria would now be resistant to three antibiotics: ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin. The
bacteria taken from plate #4 would be resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline, and after successful
conjugation with the bacteri
