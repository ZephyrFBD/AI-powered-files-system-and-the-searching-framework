A force of 3.5 N is exerted on the end of the roll for 
1.3 s, but the paper does not tear so it begins to unroll.
A constant friction torque of 
is exerted on the
roll which gradually brings it to a stop. Assuming that the
paper’s thickness is negligible, calculate (a) the length of
paper that unrolls during the time that the
force is applied (1.3 s) and (b) the length
of paper that unrolls from the time the
force ends to the time when the roll
has stopped moving.

1. Why are Eqs. 8–4 and 8–5 valid for radians but not for 
revolutions or degrees? Read Section 8–1 and follow the
derivations carefully to find the answer.
2. Total solar eclipses can happen on Earth because of 
amazing coincidences: for one, the sometimes near-perfect
alignment of Earth, Moon, and Sun. Secondly, using the
information inside the front cover, calculate the angular
