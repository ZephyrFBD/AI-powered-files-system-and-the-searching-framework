ty is a measure of the total energy captured. The net amount of energy 
captured and stored by the producers in a system is the systemâ€™s net productivity. In 
terrestrial systems, plants play the role of producer. Plants allocate that biomass (energy) 
to power processes or to be stored. Different plants have different strategies of energy 
allocation that reflect their role in various ecosystems. For example, annual weedy 
plants allocate a larger percentage of their annual biomass production to reproductive 
processes and seeds than do slower-growing perennials. As plants, the producers, are 
consumed or decomposed, the stored chemical energy powers additional individuals 
(the consumers) or trophic levels of the biotic community. Biotic systems run on energy 
much as economic systems run on money. Energy is generally in limited supply in most 
communities. Energy dynamics in a biotic community is fundamental to understanding 
ecological interactions.
