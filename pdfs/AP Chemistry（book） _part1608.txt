e an average speed, the individual molecules are moving at different speeds. 
Each molecule collides frequently with other molecules. Momentum is conserved in 
each collision, but one of the colliding molecules might be deflected off at high speed 
while the other is nearly stopped. The result is that, at any instant, the molecules in the 
sample have a wide range of speeds. In Figure 10.12(a), which shows the distribution of 
molecular speeds for nitrogen gas at 0 °C and 100 °C, we see that a larger fraction of the 
100 °C molecules moves at the higher speeds. This means that the 100 °C sample has 
the higher average kinetic energy.

CHAPTER 10 Gases
The ideal-gas equation can be derived from the five statements given 
in the text for the kinetic-molecular theory. Rather than perform 
the derivation, however, let’s consider in qualitative terms how the 
 
ideal-gas equation might follow from these statements. The total 
force of the molecular collisions on the walls and hence the
