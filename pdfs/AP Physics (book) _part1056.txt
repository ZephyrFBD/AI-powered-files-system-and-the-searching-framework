Helium balloon. What volume V of helium is needed if a
balloon is to lift a load of 180 kg (including the weight of the empty balloon)?
APPROACH The buoyant force on the helium balloon,
which is equal to the
weight of displaced air, must be at least equal to the weight of the helium plus
the weight of the balloon and load (Fig. 10–17). Table 10–1 gives the density 
of helium as 
SOLUTION The buoyant force must have a minimum value of
This equation can be written in terms of density using Archimedes’ principle:
Solving now for V, we find
NOTE This is the minimum volume needed near the Earth’s surface, where
To reach a high altitude, a greater volume would be needed
since the density of air decreases with altitude.
