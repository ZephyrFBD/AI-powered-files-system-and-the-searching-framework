ectron pairs with the single 1s electron of H to form the covalent bond that 
holds HCl together (Figure 9.12). Because the other two chlorine 3p orbitals are already 
each filled with a pair of electrons, they do not participate in the bonding to hydrogen. 
Likewise, we can explain the covalent bond in Cl2 in terms of the overlap of the singly 
occupied 3p orbital of one Cl atom with the singly occupied 3p orbital of another.
There is always an optimum distance between the two nuclei in any covalent bond. 
Figure 9.13 shows how the potential energy of a system consisting of two H atoms changes 
as the atoms come together to form an H2 molecule. When the atoms are infinitely far 
apart, they do not “feel” each other and so the energy approaches zero. As the distance 
between the atoms decreases, the overlap between their 1s orbitals increases. Because of 
the resulting increase in electron density between the nuclei, the potential energy of the 
system decreases. That is, the strength
