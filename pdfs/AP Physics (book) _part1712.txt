to concentrate the Sun’s energy directly onto a container of
water. Estimate how long it takes each system to heat 1.0 kg
of water from 25°C to 95°C. (See also Chapter 14.)

7. A dehumidifier removes water vapor from air and has been
referred to as a “refrigerator with an open door.” The humid
air is pulled in by a fan and passes over a cold coil, whose
temperature is less than the dew point, and some of the air’s
water condenses.After this water is extracted, the air is warmed
back to its original temperature and sent into the room. In a
well-designed dehumidifier, the heat that is removed by the
cooling coil mostly comes from the condensation of water
vapor to liquid, and this heat is used to re-warm the air. Esti-
mate how much water is removed in 1.0 h by an ideal
dehumidifier, if the temperature of the room is 25°C, the
water condenses at 8°
