 measure this quantity, because a 
positive value indicates that Cl2- ion is unstable and will not form.  
7.51 The electron affinity of K+ is more negative. The electron-electron 
repulsions created by adding an electron to a neutral K atom causes 
the electron affinity of K to be greater (less negative) than that of K+
.  7.53 (a) Ionization energy (I1) of Ne: Ne(g) ¡  Ne+(g) +  1 e-; 
3He42s22p6 ¡ 3He42s22p5; electron affinity (E1) of F: F(g) +  
1 e- ¡ F-(g); 3He42s22p5 ¡  3He42s22p6. (b) I1 of Ne is positive; 
E1 of F is negative. (c) One process is apparently the reverse of the 
other, with one important difference. Ne has a greater Z and Zeff, so 
we expect I1 for Ne to be somewhat greater in magnitude and opposite 
in sign to E1 for F. 7.55 (a) Decrease (b) Increase (c) The smaller the 
ﬁrst ionization energy of an element, the greater the metallic charac-
ter of that element. The trends in (a) and (b) are the opposite of the 
trends in ionization energy. 7.57 Agree. When formi
