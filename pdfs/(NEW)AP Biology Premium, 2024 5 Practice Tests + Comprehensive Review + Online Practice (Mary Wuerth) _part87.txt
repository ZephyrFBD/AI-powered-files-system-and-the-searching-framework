es and functions of macromolecules.
The structure and function of a macromolecule is determined by the types of monomers from which it is made
and how the monomers are linked.
Making and Breaking Biological Macromolecules
Biological macromolecules are formed from building blocks (i.e., monomers) that are linked by dehydration
synthesis to form larger molecules. These biological macromolecules are broken down by hydrolysis reactions.

Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are polymers of sugar monomers. The types of sugars used to make the carbohydrate and how the
sugars are linked determines the structure and function of the carbohydrate. The sugars may be joined in linear
structures or in branched chains. Carbohydrates can be used to store energy (such as in starch or glycogen) and can
also have structural functions (such as in cellulose). The type of linkages between the sugars in carbohydrates that
store energy is different from
