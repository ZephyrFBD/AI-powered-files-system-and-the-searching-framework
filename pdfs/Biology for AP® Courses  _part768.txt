structed by
analogy. Explanations of the behavior of a poorly
understood phenomenon can often be constructed by
analogy to a phenomenon that is well understood. For each
of the following cellular functions that require free energy,
describe a parallel human activity and identify a source of
free energy for that activity. For example, the synthesis of
proteins can be expected to proceed as an assembly of a
small set of sub-components, just as the construction of a
building is accomplished by gathering and joining
materials. It is consistent with our analogy to expect that
there must be a free-energy resource that is consumed in
the synthesis of proteins, just as hydrocarbon fuels are a
source of energy for the construction of a building.
60. Look at each of the processes shown in Figure 6.8 that
show examples of endergonic and exergonic processes.
1.
For each process, identify if it is endergonic or
exergonic, and provide reasoning for your
identification that includes your definition o
