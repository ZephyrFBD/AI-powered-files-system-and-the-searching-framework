Addition Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes
The presence of carbon–carbon double or triple bonds in hydrocarbons markedly 
increases their chemical reactivity. The most characteristic reactions of alkenes and 
alkynes are addition reactions, in which a reactant is added to the two atoms that 
form the multiple bond. A simple example is the addition of elemental bromine to eth-
ylene to produce 1,2-dibromoethane:
 
H2C
CH2        Br2
Br
H2C
Br
CH2

[24.1]
The p bond in ethylene is broken, and the electrons that formed the bond are used to form 
two s bonds to the two bromine atoms. The s bond between the carbon atoms is retained.
Addition of H2 to an alkene converts it to an alkane:
 
CH3CH“CHCH3 + H2
¡
Ni, 500 °C  CH3CH2CH2CH3 
[24.2]
The reaction between an alkene and H2, referred to as hydrogenation, does not occur readily 
at ordinary temperatures and pre
