14.1 The rate of the combustion reaction in the cylinder depends on 
the surface area of the droplets in the spray. The smaller the droplets, 
the greater the surface area exposed to oxygen, the faster the com-
bustion reaction. In the case of a clogged injector, larger droplets lead 
to slower combustion. Uneven combustion in the various cylinders 
can cause the engine to run roughly and decrease fuel economy.
