te” means “before nucleus,” and prokaryotes do not have nuclei. Rather, their DNA exists as a single circular
chromosome in the central part of the cell called the nucleoid. Some bacterial cells also have circular DNA plasmids that
often carry genes for resistance to antibiotics (Chapter 17). Other common prokaryotic cell features include flagella and pili.
The content presented in this section supports the learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives merge essential knowledge content with one or more of the
seven Science Practices. These objectives provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, along with inquiry-
based laboratory experiences, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions.
