was found for any 
decay. It was as if the law of conservation of energy was
being violated, and Bohr actually considered this possibility. Careful experiments
indicated that linear momentum and angular momentum also did not seem to be
conserved. Physicists were troubled at the prospect of giving up these laws, which
had worked so well in all previous situations.
In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli proposed an alternate solution: perhaps a new parti-
cle that was very difficult to detect was emitted during 
decay in addition to the
electron. This hypothesized particle could be carrying off the energy, momentum,
and angular momentum required to maintain the conservation laws. This new
particle was named the neutrino—meaning “little neutral one”—by the great
Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954; Fig. 30–7), who in 1934 worked out 
a detailed theory of 
decay. (It was Fermi who, in this theory, postulated the
existence of the fourth force in nature which we call the weak nuclear force.) The
