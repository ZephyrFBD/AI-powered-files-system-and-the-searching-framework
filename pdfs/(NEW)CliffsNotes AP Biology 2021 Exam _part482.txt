of the stomata, then, is controlled by the movement of water into and out of the guard cells.
Following is a description of the significant events that control that water movement:
1. An electrical gradient is established. The opening of stomata is
 
initiated by the active pumping of H+ out of the guard cells by H+
 
ATPase proton pumps. This establishes an electrical gradient across the
 
cell membrane. The H+ pump is activated by sunlight (specifically,
 
blue-light sensing by the chloroplast).
 
2. An osmotic gradient is established. The electrical gradient drives the
 
uptake of potassium ions (K+) into the guard cells. Chloride ions (Clâˆ’)
 
follow, driven by the electrical imbalance. This influx of ions creates a solute gradient that drives osmosis.
3. Water enters the guard cells and the stomata open. As a result of the osmotic gradient, water enters the cell,
guard cells expand, and the stomata open.
4. Water exits the guard cells and the stomata close. Closing of the
 
stomata
