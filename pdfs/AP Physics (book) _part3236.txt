ATP and energy in the cell
In living cells, many chemical reactions have activation energies that are
often on the order of several eV. Such energy barriers are not easy to overcome
in the cell. This is where enzymes come in. They act as catalysts, which means
they act to lower the activation energy so that reactions can occur that otherwise
would not. Enzymes act via the electrostatic force to distort the bonding electron
clouds, so that the initial bonds are easily broken.
29–3 Weak (van der Waals) Bonds
Once a bond between two atoms or ions is made, energy must normally be sup-
plied to break the bond and separate the atoms. As mentioned in Section 29–1,
this energy is called the bond energy or binding energy. The binding energy for
covalent and ionic bonds is typically 2 to 5 eV. These bonds, which hold atoms
together to form molecules, are often called strong bonds to distinguish them
from so-called “weak bonds.” The term weak bond, as we use it here, refers to an
attachment betwe
