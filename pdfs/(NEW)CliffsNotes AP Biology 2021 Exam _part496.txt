ves and is then transported to
apical meristems, where it initiates flower development. Identification of florigen in plants has been elusive. New
research has revealed that the production of florigen is complex, involving multiple light-absorbing pigments,
multiple genes, and multiple phytochromes. A brief description of the process is described below:
1. CONSTANS (CO) is a protein involved in measuring day length. Its mRNA is produced by the CONSTANS
(CO) gene.
 
2. Phytochromes regulate CO concentrations by either stabilizing the CO protein or allowing it to degrade.
3. The CO protein is a transcription factor that stimulates transcription of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)
gene. The FT gene produces an FT mRNA.
4. FT mRNA produces the protein FT. FT travels through phloem tissue to the shoot apex to initiate flower
development. FT is believed to be the elusive florigen.
