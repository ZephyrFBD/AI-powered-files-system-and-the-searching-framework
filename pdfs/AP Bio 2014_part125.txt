gi. Plots in the second group are sprayed with a water-soluble 
substance that selectively kills bacteria. Plots in the third group are sprayed with the same volume  
of water only. After a certain period of time, the scientist then measures the amount of accessible 
nutrients in the soil in each plot. 
(a) Describe ONE common role of both bacteria and fungi in the movement of energy and matter  
in ecosystems. (1 point; LO4.27) 
• 
Both bacteria and fungi recycle nutrients by breaking down organic matter. 
• 
Both bacteria and fungi break down dead and decaying matter as their primary energy source.  
 
(b) Describe how analyzing the data from the treatment group sprayed with water only will increase 
the validity of the experimental results. (1 point; LO2.22, 4.11, 4.19) 
• 
Describe that the water only treatment is a control that allows any change in the experimental 
groups to be attributed to the presence or absence of bacteria or fungi. 
 
(c) Based on the scientist’s claim, pred
