ase in which inflammation
is triggered by environmental factors. Inflammation obstructs the airways. The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid
accumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of
the airways, or a combination of these events. Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased
inflammation of the airways. This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 30.18).
Those with obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume
to compensate for the lack of airway recruitment.

Figure 30.18 The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep
breath) to FVC (the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diag
