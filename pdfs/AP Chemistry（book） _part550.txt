e table is organized according to the 
anion in the compound, but it also reveals many important facts about cations. Note 
that all common ionic compounds of the alkali metal ions (group 1A of the periodic table) and of 
the ammonium ions 1NH4
+2 are soluble in water.
How to Predict Whether a Precipitate Forms When Strong Electrolytes Mix
 
1. Note the ions present in the reactants.
 
2. Consider the possible cationâ€“anion combinations.
 
3. Use Table 4.1 to determine if any of the combinations is insoluble.
For example, will a precipitate form when solutions of Mg1NO322 and NaOH are 
mixed? Both substances are soluble ionic compounds and strong electrolytes. Mixing 
the solutions first produces a solution containing Mg2+, NO3
-, Na +, and OH- ions. Will 
either cation interact with either anion to form an insoluble compound? Knowing from 
Table 4.1 that Mg(NO322 and NaOH are both soluble in water, our only possibilities are 
Mg2+ with OH- and Na+ with NO3
-. From Table 4.1 we see that
