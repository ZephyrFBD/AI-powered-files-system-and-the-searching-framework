), we have 0.80 mol>L product and 0.20 mol>L reactant, 
giving Kc = 0.80>0.20 = 4.0 (or 8 spheres>2 spheres = 4.0). 
These calculations verify the order in (a).
Comment Imagine a drawing that represents a reaction with a very 
small or very large value of Kc. For example, what would the draw-
ing look like if Kc = 1 * 10-5? In that case, there would need to be

100,000 reactant molecules for only 1 product molecule. But then, 
that would be impractical to draw.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The equilibrium constant for the reaction 
N2O41g2 ∆ 2 NO21g2 at 2 °C is Kc = 2.0. If each yellow 
sphere represents 1 mol of N2O4 and each brown sphere 1 
mol of NO2 which of the following 1.0 L containers rep-
resents the equilibrium mixture at 2 °C?
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
For the reaction H21g2 + I21g2 ∆ 2 HI1g2, Kp = 794 at 298 
K and Kp = 55 at 700 K. Is the formation of HI favored more 
at the higher or lower temperature?
