ing to Raoult’s law?
 13.65  (a) Calculate the vapor pressure of water above a solution 
prepared by adding 22.5 g of lactose 1C12H22O112 to 200.0 g 
 
of water at 338 K. (Vapor–pressure data for water are given 
in Appendix B.) (b) Calculate the mass of propylene glycol 
1C3H8O22 that must be added to 0.340 kg of water to reduce 
the vapor pressure by 2.88 torr at 40 °C.
 13.66  (a) Calculate the vapor pressure of water above a solu-
tion prepared by dissolving 28.5 g of glycerin 1C3H8O32 
in 125 g of water at 343 K. (The vapor pressure of water is 
given in Appendix B.) (b) Calculate the mass of ethylene 
glycol 1C2H6O22 that must be added to 1.00 kg of ethanol 
1C2H5OH2 to reduce its vapor pressure by 10.0 torr at 35 °C. 
The vapor pressure of pure ethanol at 35 °C is 1.00 * 102 
torr.
 
[13.67] At 63.5 °C, the vapor pressure of H2O is 175 torr, and that of 
ethanol 1C2H5OH2 is 400 torr. A solution is made by mix-
ing equal masses o
