old conditions, the epidermis
may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration. A waxy layer known as the cuticle
covers the leaves of all plant species. The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have
small hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surface. Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing
toxic or bad-tasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface
(Figure 23.25).

Figure 23.25 Trichomes give leaves a fuzzy appearance as in this (a) sundew (Drosera sp.). Leaf trichomes include (b)
branched trichomes on the leaf of Arabidopsis lyrata and (c) multibranched trichomes on a mature Quercus marilandica
leaf. (credit a: John Freeland; credit b, c: modification of work by Robert R. Wise; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
