Figure 21.5 Viruses are classified based on their core genetic material and capsid design. (a) Rabies virus has a
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) core and an enveloped helical capsid, whereas (b) variola virus, the causative agent of
smallpox, has a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) core and a complex capsid. Rabies transmission occurs when saliva
from an infected mammal enters a wound. The virus travels through neurons in the peripheral nervous system to the
central nervous system where it impairs brain function, and then travels to other tissues. The virus can infect any
mammal, and most die within weeks of infection. Smallpox is a human virus transmitted by inhalation of the variola
virus, localized in the skin, mouth, and throat, which causes a characteristic rash. Before its eradication in 1979,
infection resulted in a 30â€“35 percent mortality rate. (cred
