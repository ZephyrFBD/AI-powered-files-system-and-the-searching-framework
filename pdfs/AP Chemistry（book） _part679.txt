9 A sample of 7.75 g of Mg1OH22 is added to 25.0 mL of 
0.200 M HNO3. (a) Write the chemical equation for the re-
action that occurs. (b) Which is the limiting reactant in 
the reaction? (c) How many moles of Mg1OH22, HNO3, and 
Mg1NO322 are present after the reaction is complete?
 4.110 In 2014, a major chemical leak at a facility in West Virginia 
released 7500 gallons of MCHM (4-methylcyclohexylmeth-
anol, C8H16O) into the Elk River. The density of MCHM is 
0.9074 g/mL. (a) Calculate the initial molarity of MCHM 
in the river, assuming that the first part of the river is 7.00 
feet deep, 100.0 yards wide, and 100.0 yards long. 1 gallon
= 3.785 L. (b) How much farther down the river would the 
spill have to spread in order to achieve a “safe” MCHM con-
centration of 1.00 * 10-4 M? Assume the depth and width 
of the river are constant and the concentration of MCHM is 
uniform along the length of the spill.
