 how it comes to “travel.”
We first look at a single wave bump, or pulse. A single pulse can be formed on 
a cord by a quick up-and-down motion of the hand, Fig. 11–23. The hand pulls 
up on one end of the cord. Because the end section is attached to adjacent sections,
these also feel an upward force and they too begin to move upward. As each 
succeeding section of cord moves upward, the wave crest moves outward along the
cord. Meanwhile, the end section of cord has been returned to its original position
by the hand. As each succeeding section of cord reaches its peak position, it too
is pulled back down again by tension from the adjacent section of cord. Thus the
source of a traveling wave pulse is a disturbance (or vibration), and cohesive forces
between adjacent sections of cord cause the pulse to travel. Waves in other media are
created and propagate outward in a similar fashion. A dramatic example of a wave
pulse is a tsunami or tidal wave that is created by an earthquake in the E
