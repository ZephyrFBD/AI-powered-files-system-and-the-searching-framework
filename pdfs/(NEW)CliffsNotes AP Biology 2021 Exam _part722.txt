tmosphere. On the other hand, respiration adds CO2 to the
atmosphere, as does the burning of
 
any organic fuel such as wood, coal, oil, natural gas, and gasoline. 16. B. Depending on soil conditions and plant
species, plants absorb
 
nitrogen either in the form of NH4+ or NO3−. Denitrifying by soil bacteria converts NO3− to gaseous N2, a form of

NH4+ or NO3−.
