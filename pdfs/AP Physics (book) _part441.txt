while the jetliner she is in accelerates for takeoff, which
takes about 16 s. Estimate the takeoff speed of the aircraft
if the string makes an angle of 25° with
respect to the vertical, Fig. 4–64.

71. A city planner is working on the redesign of a hilly portion
of a city. An important consideration is how steep the
roads can be so that even low-powered cars can get up the
hills without slowing down. A particular small car, with a
mass of 920 kg, can accelerate on a level road from rest to

maximum steepness of a hill.
