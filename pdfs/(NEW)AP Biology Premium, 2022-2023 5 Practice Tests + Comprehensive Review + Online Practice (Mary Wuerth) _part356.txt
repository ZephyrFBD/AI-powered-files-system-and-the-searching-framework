other 50% of the DNA molecules would contain one strand with only N-15 and one
strand with only N-14. Choice (A) describes the result of only one round of DNA replication if DNA replication
was semiconservative, not the result of two rounds of DNA replication. So (A) is incorrect. Conservative DNA
replication would produce the result described in choice (B), so (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because
it describes the result if no replication was happening at all.
7. (D) Because the two strands of DNA are antiparallel and because DNA polymerase can only add new
nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction, replication must occur differently on the two strands of DNA. On the strand
of the double helix that is oriented in the 3′ to 5′ direction, DNA polymerase can perform replication
continuously, adding a new antiparallel strand one nucleotide at a time in the 5′ to 3′ direction. On the opposite
strand of the double helix that is oriented in the 5′ to 3′ direction, DNA polymerase must
