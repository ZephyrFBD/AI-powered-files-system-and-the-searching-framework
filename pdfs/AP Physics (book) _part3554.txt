 1940s, after World War II, it was found that if the incoming particle in
a nuclear reaction (Section 31–1) has sufficient energy, new types of particles can
be produced. The earliest experiments used cosmic rays—particles that impinge
on the Earth from space. In the laboratory, various types of particle accelerators
have been constructed to accelerate protons or electrons to high energies so they
can collide with other particles—often protons (the hydrogen nucleus). Heavy ions,
up to lead (Pb), have also been accelerated. These high-energy accelerators have
been used to probe more deeply into matter, to produce and study new particles,
and to give us information about the basic forces and constituents of nature. The
particles produced in high-energy collisions can be detected by a variety of spe-
cial detectors, discussed in Section 30–13, including scintillation counters, bubble
chambers, multiwire chambers, and semiconductors. The rate of production of
