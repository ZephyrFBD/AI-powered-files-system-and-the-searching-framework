the average global air temperature of 0.390.6 °C over the past century. Scientists often 
use the term climate change instead of global warming to refer to this effect because as the 
Earth’s temperature increases, winds and ocean currents are affected in ways that cool 
some areas and warm others.
On the basis of present and expected future rates of fossil-fuel use, the atmospheric 
CO2 level is expected to double from its present level sometime between 2050 and 2100. 
Computer models predict that this increase will result in an average global temperature 
increase of 1 °C to 3 °C. Because so many factors go into determining climate, we cannot 
predict with certainty what changes will occur because of this warming. Clearly, however, 
atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases are rising as a result of 
human activity. The effects of these changes on the climate are already being felt, and if 
left unchecked they have the potential  to substantially alter the cl
