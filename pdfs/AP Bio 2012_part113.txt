d core processes and features support the 
concept of common ancestry for all organisms.
(A)
This option is incorrect because there are no reference organisms described 
that share this common ancestor. Chloroplasts evolved from endosymbiotic 
prokaryotes, and this places the evolutionary connection at an earlier pre-
eukaryotic stage. The data do not support the claim that FtsZ and tubulin were 
present in a common ancestor.
(B)
This option is incorrect because microtubules have no direct involvement in 
photosynthesis. Even if there is some indirect involvement, this claim does not 
support the relationship between tubulin proteins in eukaryotes and FtsZ proteins 
in prokaryotes and chloroplasts.
(C)
This option is correct. The evidence states that the FtsZ gene is present in 
prokaryotes and in chloroplasts. Chloroplasts evolved from endosymbiotic 
prokaryotes. The tubulin protein is structurally and functionally similar to 
FtsZ and is found in eukaryotes, inferring evolutionary de
