that costs sixpence. I’d 
 
 love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation 
 
 catechism but I don’t think I’ll live that long the way I’m 
 
 expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big 
 
 people who haven’t died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask 
 
 a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you’re told 
 
 go out and play.

 It’s very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. 
 
 He’s eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. 
 
 People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction 
 
 means.Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and 
 
  
  
 he reads books. He’s the expert in the lane on Girls’ Bodies and Dirty 
 
 Things in General and he promises, I’ll tell you everything, Frankie,when 
 
 you’re eleven like me and you’re not so thick and ignorant. 
 
 It’s a good thing he says Frankie
