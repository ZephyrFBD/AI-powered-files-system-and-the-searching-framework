nt has a lower water potential than that of the plant, the plant will lose water to its environment. The
lower the water potential in the environment around the plant, the greater the rate of water loss from transpiration.
Several variables can be used to measure which has the greatest effect on the rate of water loss due to transpiration:
Increased humidity
Increased light intensity
Increased wind
In this lab, a plant can be attached to a potometer, which measures water loss in the plant. The amount of total water
loss over a defined time period is measured and can be graphed, as shown in Figure 24.12.

Lab 12: Fruit Fly Behavior
Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) have been used as a model organism in scientific studies for over 100 years.
Their small size and low maintenance requirements make them very useful in labs around the world. In this lab,
Drosophila preferences for a wide variety of experimental conditions can be tested.
