tion pathway, a ligand, in
this case the hormone, must bind to the membrane receptor protein.
When the correct ligand is bound, the receptor proteins undergoes a
conformational change, which sets oﬀ an intracellular cascade. Thus,
(D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because the image does not depict the
membrane bound protein undergoing a conformational change to
form a small pore for an ion to travel through when attached to the
ligand. Rather, it shows a signaling cascade as the receptor activates a
molecule which, in turn, has its own eﬀects. (B) occurs aȇer the
conformational change occurs and is followed by (C), the activation or
deactivation of certain genes or transcription factors. Both of these
choices are incorrect because they do not occur immediately as the
hormone binds to the receptor.
7. C
Learning Objective: 8.4
While all four answer choices provide examples of drug therapies that
are currently in use, (C) fails to demonstrate how insulin therapy
utilizes the principle beh
