and pressure.
pressure (torr) versus temperature 1°C2. From your plot, 
estimate the vapor pressure of water at body tempera-
ture, 37 °C. (b) Explain the signiﬁcance of the data point 
at 760.0 torr, 100 °C. (c) A city at an altitude of 5000 ft 
above sea level has a barometric pressure of 633 torr. To 
what temperature would you have to heat water to boil 
it in this city? (d) A city at an altitude of 500 ft below sea 
level would have a barometric pressure of 774 torr. To 
what temperature would you have to heat water to boil it 
in this city?

diagram? (b) Why does the line that separates the gas and 
liquid phases end at the critical point?
 11.58  (a) What is the signiﬁcance of the triple point in a phase 
diagram? (b) Could you measure the triple point of water 
by measuring the temperature in a vessel in which water
