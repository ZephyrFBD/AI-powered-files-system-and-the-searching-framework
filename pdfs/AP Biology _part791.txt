male (XY) or female (XX).
In the absence of a signal from female gonads, all embryos
develop as female, regardless of whether they are genetically
male (XY) or female (XX).
Determination of the sex of an embryo is controlled by
genotype only: male (XY) or female (XX).
The results of Jost’s experiment could be explained if some aspect
of surgery, other than gonad removal, caused female genitalia to
develop. If you were to repeat Jost’s experiment, how would you
improve the protocol to test this alternative hypothesis?
Remove only the gonads that will develop into testes from the
embryos of the experimental group.
Repeat the experiment as is several times.
Carry out sham surgeries on the control group; remove the
embryos from the mothers, but do not remove any genital
structures.
