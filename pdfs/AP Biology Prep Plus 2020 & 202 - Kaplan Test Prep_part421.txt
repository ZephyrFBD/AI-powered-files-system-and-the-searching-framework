Cellular respiration can be divided into several stages:
glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle, and
the electron transport chain.
5.
Cellular respiration is a complex process that requires many
diï¬€erent products and specialized molecules. Focus on the
requirements and overall net production for the major steps.

2. Autotrophs capture free energy to produce organic compounds
for food while heterotrophs metabolize carbon compounds
produced by other organisms as sources of free energy. Which of
the following best demonstrates the function of CO2 in
autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism?
Autotrophs use CO2 to make glucose in the Calvin cycle, and
