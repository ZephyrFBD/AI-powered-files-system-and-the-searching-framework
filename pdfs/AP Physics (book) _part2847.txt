ields the total absorption (called a “projection”) along that
beam line. Complicated mathematical techniques are used to analyze all the
absorption projections for the huge number of beam scans measured (see the
next Subsection), obtaining the absorption at each pixel and assigning each a
“grayness value” according to how much radiation was absorbed. The image is
made up of tiny spots (pixels) of varying shades of gray. Often the amount of
absorption is color-coded. The colors in the resulting false-color image have
nothing to do, however, with the actual color of the object. The actual images are
monochromatic (various shades of gray, depending on the absorption). Only
visible light has color; X-rays do not.
Figure 25–44 illustrates what actual CT images look like. It is generally agreed
that CT scanning has revolutionized some areas of medicine by providing much
less invasive, and or more accurate, diagnosis.
Computed tomography can also be applied to ultrasound imaging
