Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, and the changes that 
matter undergoes. As you progress in your study, you will come to see 
how chemical principles operate in all aspects of our lives, from everyday 
activities like food preparation to more complex processes such as those 
that operate in the environment. We will also learn how the properties 
of substances can be tailored for specific applications by controlling 
their composition and structure. For example, the synthetic pigments 
chemists developed in the nineteenth century were used extensively by 
impressionist artists like van Gogh and Monet.
This first chapter provides an overview of what chemistry is about 
and what chemists do. The “What’s Ahead” list gives an overview of the 
chapter organization and of some of the ideas we will consider.

The title of this book—Chemistry: 
The Central Science—reflects the fact 
that much of what goes on in the world around us 
involves chemistry. Everyday chemical proc
