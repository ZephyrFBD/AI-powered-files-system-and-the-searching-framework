 to the cell membrane by lipoteichoic acid.
b.
Porins allow entry of substances into both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
c.
The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is thick, and the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is thin.
d.
Gram-negative bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, whereas Gram-positive bacteria have a cell
wall made of lipoteichoic acid.
Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan. There are four different types of Archaean cell walls. One type is
composed of pseudopeptidoglycan, which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the
polysaccharide chain. The other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or pure protein.
