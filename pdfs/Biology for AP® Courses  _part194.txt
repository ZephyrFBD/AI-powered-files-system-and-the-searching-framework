heat capacity of any liquids. Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose
to change its temperature by one degree Celsius. For water, this amount is one calorie. It therefore takes water a long time
to heat and long time to cool. In fact, the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand. This
explains why the land cools faster than the sea. Due to its high heat capacity, water is used
