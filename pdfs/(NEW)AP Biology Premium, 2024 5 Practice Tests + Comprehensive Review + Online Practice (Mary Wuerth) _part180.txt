Choice (B) is incorrect because some enzymes may be more effective at higher temperatures (for example,
enzymes found in bacteria that live in warm environments). While increasing the temperature does increase the
number of molecular collisions, choice (C) is incorrect because boiling would denature the enzyme, making it
an ineffective catalyst. Choice (D) is incorrect because if the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction was faster at
higher temperatures, the average time for disks to float would decrease, not increase.
3. (C) The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 6% concentration of enzyme (15.1 + 2(4.5) = 24.1)
is greater than the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 3% concentration of enzyme (32.5 â€“ 2(5.9)
= 20.7), so their 95% confidence intervals overlap. When 95% confidence intervals overlap, it is not possible to
say there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, choice (C) is the correct answer.
The 95% confidence
