.
(c) To increase the rate of production of plutonium-239.
(d) To increase the critical mass of the fission fuel.
(e) To provide more neutrons for the reaction.
(f) All of the above.
6. What is the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear
fusion?
(a) Nuclear fission is used for bombs; nuclear fusion is
used in power plants.
(b) There is no difference. Fission and fusion are different
names for the same physical phenomenon.
(c) Nuclear fission refers to using deuterium to create a
nuclear reaction.
(d) Nuclear fusion occurs spontaneously, as happens to
the 
used in carbon dating.
(e) In nuclear fission, a nucleus splits; in nuclear fusion,
nucleons or nuclei and nucleons join to form a new
nucleus.
7. A primary difficulty in energy production by fusion is
(a) the scarcity of necessary fuel.
(b) the disposal of radioactive by-products produced.
(c) the high temperatures necessary to overcome the
electrical repulsion of protons.
(d) the fact that it is possible in volcanic regions o
