 produced through photosynthetic (or
chemosynthetic) activity per unit of time. Components of primary productivity include the following (note that the
term rate means per unit time):
1. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the rate at which producers acquire chemical energy before any of this
energy is used for metabolism.
2. Net primary productivity (NPP) is the rate at which producers acquire chemical energy less the rate at which
they consume energy through respiration. NPP represents the biomass available to herbivores.
3. Respiratory rate (R) is the rate at which energy is consumed through respiration (and other metabolic activities
necessary to maintain life). This energy, much of it in the form of ATP, is ultimately lost as heat.
These components are related by the following equation.
NPP = GPP - R
NPP, generated at the bottom tier of the ecological pyramid of energy, supports all of the tiers above it. Energy
stored in NPP is transferred to herbivores when they eat the primary
