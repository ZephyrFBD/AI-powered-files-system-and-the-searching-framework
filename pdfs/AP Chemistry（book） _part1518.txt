 9.77 (a) What does the term diamagnetism mean? (b) How does 
a diamagnetic substance respond to a magnetic field? 
(c) Which of the following ions would you expect to be 
diamagnetic: N2
2 -, O2
2 -, Be2
2 +, C2
-?
 9.78  (a) What does the term paramagnetism mean? (b) How can one 
determine experimentally whether a substance is paramag-
netic? (c) Which of the following ions would you expect to be 
paramagnetic: O2
+ , N2
2 -, Li2
+ , O2
2 - ? For those ions that are 
paramagnetic, determine the number of unpaired electrons.
 9.79 Using Figures 9.35 and 9.43 as guides, draw the molecular or-
bital electron configuration for (a) B2
+ , (b) Li2
+ , (c) N2
+ , (d) 
Ne2
2 +. In each case indicate whether the addition of an elec-
tron to the ion would increase or decrease the bond order of 
the species.
 9.80  If we assume that the energy-level diagrams for homonu-
clear diatomic molecules shown in Figure 9.43 can be ap-
plied to heteronuclear diatomic molecules and ions, predict 
the bond
