NA polymerases are involved in the transcription of DNA into RNA, not the replication of DNA. The major
enzyme for DNA replication is DNA polymerase (not one of the answer choices). Primase directs the attachment of
RNA nucleotides to a DNA template, but those RNA primers must be in place before DNA polymerase can attach
and begin attaching DNA nucleotides.
5. D. Since ATP contains the adenine nitrogen base, the sugar ribose (not deoxyribose), and three phosphate groups,
it is equivalent to the adenine RNA nucleotide with two extra phosphate groups. In contrast, an adenine DNA
nucleotide with two extra phosphates contains a deoxyribose sugar and is written as dATP.
6. B. Translation is the process in which ribosomes conduct the matching of tRNA with mRNA, producing an amino
acid chain, or polypeptide.
7. D. The mRNA is a sequence of nucleotides. Each triplet of nucleotides codes for a particular amino acid. The
sequence of triplets on the mRNA corresponds to the sequence of amino acids
