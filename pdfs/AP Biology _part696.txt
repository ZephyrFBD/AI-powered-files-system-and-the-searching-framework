c processes (oxidizing sugar) to
produce body heat. The body temperature of endotherms remains constant.
In a cold environment, an endotherm can keep its body warmer than the
environment. The temperature of the human body fluctuates during the
course of a day, but the average temperature is 37°C (98.6°F). All
mammals and birds are endotherms. Some scientists believe that certain
dinosaurs may have been endotherms. The term endotherm is closest in
meaning to the common term warm-blooded, which has no real scientific
meaning.
In terms of energy consumption, endothermy is very costly. Humans
can use 60% of what we eat to maintain our body heat. The metabolic rate
of a mammal is much higher than that of a reptile of similar size. As a
consequence, mammals must take in many more calories than a reptile of
similar size. When considering the metabolic requirements of mammals, in
general, the smaller the mammal the faster the metabolism is. Flying birds
have an even higher metabolic requiremen
