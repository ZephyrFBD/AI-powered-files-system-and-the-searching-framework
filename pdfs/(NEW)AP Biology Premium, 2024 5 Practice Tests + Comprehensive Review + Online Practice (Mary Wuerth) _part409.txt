e. If RNA polymerase cannot bind, transcription cannot
occur. If P were deleted, no transcription of THY-1 would occur, as shown in the following figure.

Overview
The tools of biotechnology are being used for many purposes: cancer therapies, improvement in agriculture yields,
gene therapies for genetic disorders, de-extinction projects (such as the one to bring back the woolly mammoth), and
extinction projects (trying to eliminate pathogens that cause human disease), just to name a few. Understanding the
basics of how these techniques work, and their possible uses and misuses, is very important. This chapter will briefly
review a few basic biotechnology techniques to know for test day.
Bacterial Transformation
Bacterial transformation introduces foreign DNA into bacterial cells. The foreign DNA, usually a small, circular
