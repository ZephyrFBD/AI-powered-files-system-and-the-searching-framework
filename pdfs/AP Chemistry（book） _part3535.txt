exhibit both acidic and basic characters are said to be amphoteric. 
 (Section 17.5) If a metal forms more than one oxide, the basic character of the oxide 
decreases as the oxidation state of the metal increases (Table 22.4).
Peroxides and Superoxides
Compounds containing O ¬O bonds and oxygen in the -1 oxidation state are perox-
ides. Oxygen has an oxidation state of -1
2 in O2
-, which is called the superoxide ion. The 
most active (easily oxidized) metals (K, Rb, and Cs) react with O2 to give superoxides 
1KO2, RbO2, and CsO22. Their active neighbors in the periodic table (Na, Ca, Sr, and Ba) 
react with O2, producing peroxides 1Na2O2, CaO2, SrO2, and BaO22. Less active metals 
and nonmetals produce normal oxides. 
 (Section 7.6)
When superoxides dissolve in water, O2 is produced:
 
4 KO21s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡  4 K+1aq2 + 4 OH -1aq2 + 3 O21g2 
[22.26]
Because of this reaction, potassium superoxide is used as an oxygen source in masks 
worn by rescue workers (Figure 22.13). For proper bre
