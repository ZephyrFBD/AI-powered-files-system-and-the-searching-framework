■ General Safety Precautions 
Follow general laboratory safety procedures. Wear proper footwear, safety goggles or 
glasses, a laboratory coat, and gloves. Use proper pipetting techniques, and use pipette 
pumps, syringes, or rubber bulbs. Never pipette by mouth! Dispose of any broken 
glass in the proper container. Since the concentrations of the reactive materials in this 
laboratory are environmentally friendly (0.1% hydrogen peroxide and 0.3% guaiacol), 
they can be rinsed down a standard laboratory drain. The concentrations used here 
are deemed to be safe by all chemical standards, but recall that any compound has 
the potentiality of being detrimental to living things and the environment. When you 
develop your individual investigations you must always consider the toxicity of materials 
used.
