ection. Specifically, this is an example of a random assortment of plants screened for a specific trait.
Exercise 1B:
 Analyzing Plant Trichomes (2nd Generation)
Interpretation of this Exercise
This second figure demonstrates a second generation of plants that have been preselected to be
grown based on having a desired characteristic (in this case, plant hairs).
The goal of artificial selection is to favor a desired trait for a specific reason and is faster than natural
selection at having organisms demonstrate this characteristic because the next generation can be
absolutely restricted to offspring of parents that meet the desired criteria.
In contrast, natural selection depends on the environment to do the selecting; therefore, traits like
trichome would show up at a significantly slower rate than seen in two generations of plants.
Questions on these figures may center on asking whether this figure demonstrates artificial selection
and why. How do you know for sure? The answer is: Ye
