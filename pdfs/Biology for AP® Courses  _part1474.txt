D. At first, Bateson and Punnett did not see that these
genes are located on the same chromosome and proceeded
to measure the linkage distance between them, taking the
first step toward creating a gene map. Justify the selection
of data and the procedure from which data could be
collected that would have provided the necessary evidence
to confirm linkage and recombination.
21. Review the observations that provided researchers with
evidence in support of the Chromosomal Theory of
Inheritance.
A. Evaluate the dependence of these observations on
improvements in a critical technology during the period
from 1850 to 1940. Identify this technology and describe
how this technology allowed scientists to make the
connection between chromosomes and genes. (As a hint,
the name “chromosome” is taken from the Greek word
chroma, which means colored or stained.)
B. Mendel’s laws of inheritance are explained by the
chromosomal theory. Use
