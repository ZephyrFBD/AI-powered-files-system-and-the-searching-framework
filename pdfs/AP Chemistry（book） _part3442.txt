t a beam of gamma rays at the tumor. Particle accelerators are 
also used as an external source of high-energy radiation for radiation 
therapy.
Because gamma radiation is so strongly penetrating, it is nearly 
impossible to avoid damaging healthy cells during radiation ther-
apy. Many cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment experi-
ence unpleasant and dangerous side effects such as fatigue, nausea, 
hair loss, a weakened immune system, and occasionally even death. 
However, if other treatments such as chemotherapy (the use of drugs to 
combat cancer) fail, radiation therapy can be a good option.
Much current research in radiation therapy is engaged in devel-
oping new drugs that speciﬁcally target tumors using a method called 
neutron capture therapy. In this technique, a nonradioactive isotope, 
usually boron-10, is concentrated in the tumor by using speciﬁc 
tumor-seeking reagents. The boron-10 is then irradiated with neu-
trons, where it undergoes the following nuclear react
