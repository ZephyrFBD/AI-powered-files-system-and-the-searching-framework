Simple display screens, such as for watches and calculators, use ambient light
as the source (you can’t see the display in the dark), with a mirror behind the
LCD to reflect the light back. There are only a few pixels, corresponding to the
elongated segments needed to form the numbers from 0 to 9 (and letters in some
displays), as seen in Fig. 24–52. Any pixels to which a voltage is applied appear
dark and form part of a number. With no voltage, pixels pass light through the
polarizers to the mirror and back out, which forms a bright background. Displays
with white numbers on a dark background have the voltages reversed.
Television, cell phone, and computer LCDs are more sophisticated. A color
pixel consists of three cells, or subpixels, each covered with a red, green, or blue
filter (Fig. 24–53). Varying brightnesses of these three primary col
