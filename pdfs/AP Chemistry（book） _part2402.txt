(b) The equilibrium-constant expression is
Kc =
3CO242
3CO42
Because SnO2 and Sn are pure solids, their concentrations do 
not appear in the equilibrium-constant expression.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the equilibrium that is established in a saturated 
solution of silver chloride, Ag+1aq2 + Cl-1aq2 ∆ AgCl1s2. 
If solid AgCl is added to this solution, what will happen to 
the concentration of Ag+ and Cl- ions in solution?  
(a) 3Ag+4 and 3Cl-4 will both increase (b) 3Ag+4 and 3Cl-4 will 
both decrease (c) 3Ag+4 will increase and 3Cl-4 will decrease  
(d) 3Ag+4 will decrease and 3Cl-4 will increase (e) neither 
3Ag+4 nor 3Cl-4 will change
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the following equilibrium-constant expressions:
(a) Kc for Cr1s2 + 3 Ag+1aq2 ∆ Cr3+1aq2 + 3 Ag1s2,
(b) Kp for 3 Fe1s2 + 4 H2O1g2 ∆ Fe3O41s2 + 4 H21g2.

If some of the CO21g2 were released from the bell jar on the 
left, the seal then restored and the system allowed to return to 
equilibrium, would the amount o
