cell.
Give It Some Thought
The standard reduction potential of Ni2+1aq2 is E°
red = -0.28 V, and that of 
Fe2+1aq2 is E°
red = -0.44 V. In a Ni–Fe voltaic cell, which electrode is the cathode, 
Ni or Fe?

A voltaic cell is based on the two standard half-reactions
Cd2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Cd1s2
Sn2+1aq2 + 2 e- ¡ Sn1s2
Use data in Appendix E to determine (a) which half-reaction occurs at the cathode and which occurs at the anode and (b) the 
standard cell potential.
Solve
(a) According to Appendix E, E°
red1Cd2+>Cd2 = -0.40 V and 
E°
red1Sn2+>Sn2 = -0.14 V. The standard reduction potential 
for Sn2+ is more positive (less negative) than that for Cd2+. 
Hence, the reduction of Sn2+ is the reaction that occurs at t
