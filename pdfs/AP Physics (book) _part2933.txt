t rest.
Length contraction, like time dilation, is not noticeable in everyday life
because the factor 
in Eq. 26–3a differs significantly from 1.00 only
when v is very large.
Painting’s contraction. A rectangular painting measures
1.00 m tall and 1.50 m wide, Fig. 26–9a. It is hung on the side wall of a spaceship
which is moving past the Earth at a speed of 0.90c. (a) What are the dimen-
sions of the picture according to the captain of the spaceship? (b) What are the
dimensions as seen by an observer on the Earth?
APPROACH We apply the length contraction formula, Eq. 26–3a, to the dimen-
sion parallel to the motion; v is the speed of the painting relative to the Earth
observer.
SOLUTION (a) The painting is at rest 
on the spaceship so it (as well 
as everything else in the spaceship) looks perfectly normal to everyone on the
spaceship. The captain sees a 1.00-m by 1.50-m painting.
(b) Only the dimension in the direction of motion is shortened, so the height is
unchanged at 1.00 m, Fig.
