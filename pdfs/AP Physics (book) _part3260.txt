atoms in (a) a simple cubic crystal,

now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
29–6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals;
Fermi Energy
The free-electron theory of metals considers electrons in a metal as being in con-
stant motion like an ideal gas, which we discussed in Chapter 13. For a classical
ideal gas, at very low temperatures near absolute zero,
all the particles
would be in the lowest state, with zero kinetic energy 
But the
situation is vastly different for an electron gas because, according to quantum
