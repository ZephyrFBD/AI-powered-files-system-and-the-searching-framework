 pronounced
growth, DNA replication, and crucial preparation for cellular division.
DNA replication errors during this process, if not detected and fixed,
would result in mutations being passing on to daughter cells. (A) is
thus correct. (B) is incorrect because unrepaired mutations would be
passed on. (C) and (D) are incorrect because cells do in fact grow
during interphase.

The most likely explanation for an oﬀspring having a genetically
influenced trait that neither of its parents possesses is that the parents
were carriers (heterozygous) for the trait. (B) is thus correct. (A) is
incorrect because it misidentifies crossing over as “genetic driȇ” and
because crossing over only results in the exchange of genetic
information between chromosomes, so it could not bring into being a
new allele for red hair. (C) is incorrect because the Y chromosome
predominantly contains genes that influence primary and secondary
sexual characteristics in males, so it is unl
