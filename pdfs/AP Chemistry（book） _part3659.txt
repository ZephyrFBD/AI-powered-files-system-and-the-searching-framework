f the coordination compounds we examine in this chapter contain transition-metal 
ions, although ions of other metals can also form complexes.
 
SECTION 23.2  Transition-Metal Complexes 
993
The molecules or ions that bond to the metal ion in a complex are known as 
ligands (from the Latin word ligare, “to bind”). There are two NH3 ligands bonded to 
Ag+ in the complex ion 3Ag(NH3)24+, for instance, and six H2O ligands bonded to Fe3+ 
in 3Fe(H2O)643+. Each ligand functions as a Lewis base and so donates a pair of electrons 
to form the ligand–metal bond. 
 (Section 16.11) Thus, every ligand has at least one 
unshared pair of valence electrons. Four of the most frequently encountered ligands,

illustrate that most ligands are either polar molecules or anions. In forming a complex, 
the ligands are said to coordinate to the metal.
Give It Some Thought
Is the interaction between an ammonia ligand and a metal cation a Lewis acid–base 
interaction? If so, which speci
