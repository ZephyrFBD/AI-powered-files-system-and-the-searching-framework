d pressure of CS2 (552 K and  
78 atm, respectively) are both higher than those given for 
CO2 in Table 11.5 (304 K and 73 atm, respectively). The differ-
ence in critical temperatures is especially notable. The higher 
values for CS2 arise from the greater dispersion attractions 
between the CS2 molecules compared with CO2. These greater 
attractions are due to the larger size of the sulfur compared to 
oxygen and, therefore, its greater polarizability.
oxidation products.) (d) The critical temperature and pressure for CS2 are 552 K and 78 atm, respectively. Compare these values 
with those for CO2 in Table 11.5 and discuss the possible origins of the differences.

Learning Outcomes After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
t Identify the intermolecular attractive interactions (dispersion, 
dipole–dipole, hydrogen bonding, ion–dipole) that exist between 
molecules or ions based on their composition and molecular 
structure and compare the relative strengths
