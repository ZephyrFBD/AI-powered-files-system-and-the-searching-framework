DNA-editing mechanisms would not work on RNA because
DNA and RNA have significant structural diﬀerences.

Transduction, the uptake of new genetic material by viral infection can
occur in the lytic or lysogenic cycle. During the lysogenic cycle, the
viral genome integrates into specific locations on the host
chromosome. When certain environmental stimuli trigger the
prophage to exit the lysogenic cycle and enter the lytic cycle, the
phage DNA is excised from the host chromosome. Sometimes, the
excision process is imprecise, and the phage DNA will contain a small
part of bacterial DNA that was adjacent to the original insertion site.
When the new virus infects a subsequent bacterium, it injects DNA
from the previous bacterium into the host cell. This is known as
specialized transduction, in which only genes from a particular region
of the bacterial chromosome are transferred to another bacterium.
The question stem asks how a single specialized gene could be
