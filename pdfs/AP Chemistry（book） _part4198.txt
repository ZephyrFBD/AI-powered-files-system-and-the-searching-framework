page 1052 1CH224CHO page 1053 The generic formula of an 
ether is ROR’, while an ester is RCOOR’. If you carbonylate or oxidize 
an ether, you can get an ester. page 1057 All four groups must be 
different from one another. page 1060 No. Breaking the hydrogen 
bonds between N ¬ H and O “C groups in a protein by heating 
causes the a-helix structure to unwind and the b-sheet structure to 
separate. page 1065 The alpha form of the C ¬ O ¬ C linkage. 
Glycogen serves as a source of energy in the body, which means 
that the body’s enzymes must be able to hydrolyze it to sugars. The 
enzymes work only on polysaccharides having the a linkage.
change in entropy of the surroundings in an isothermal process is

. Because the reaction is exothermic, -qsys is a posi-
tive number. Thus, ∆Ssurr is a positive number and the entropy of the 
surroundings increases. page 826 (a) In any spontaneous process 
the entropy of the universe increases. (b) In any
