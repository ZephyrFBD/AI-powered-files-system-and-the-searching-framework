 cold periods but are not metabolic strategies for 
meeting their energy needs.
(B)
This option is incorrect because this fact comparing bacterial and eukaryotic 
genomes and the presence of introns has nothing to do with these organisms 
meeting their energy needs by varying metabolic strategies.
(C)
This option is incorrect. Metabolism is defined as the totality of an organismâ€™s 
chemical reactions. The type of teeth organisms have would not be considered a 
metabolic strategy but rather a structural strategy.
(D)
This option is correct. Starch, glycogen, and fat are all molecules used for 
energy storage, yet plants have evolved to use starch while animals have 
evolved to use fat for long-term energy storage and glycogen for short-term 
energy storage.
