locks the cell cycle at the G1 checkpoint until the cell achieves a requisite size.
What is the most likely mechanism that Rb employs to halt the cell cycle?
•
A cell has a mutation that results in the production of an abnormal cyclin-dependent kinase at the G2/M
checkpoint. What is a likely consequence of the mutation on the cell cycle?

Cancer results from unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle. The
loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty
instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. One culprit that has been identified is the
