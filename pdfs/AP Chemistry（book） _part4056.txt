dispersion forces. The larger contact surface between butane 
molecules facilitates stronger forces and produces a higher boiling 
point. 11.25 (a) A molecule must contain H atoms, bound to either 
N, O, or F atoms, in order to participate in hydrogen bonding with like 
molecules. (b) CH3NH2 and CH3OH 11.27 (a) Replacing a hydroxyl 
hydrogen with a CH3 group eliminates hydrogen bonding in that part 
of the molecule. This reduces the strength of intermolecular forces 
and leads to a lower boiling point. (b) CH3OCH2CH2OCH3 is a larger, 
more polarizable molecule with stronger London dispersion forces 
and thus a higher boiling point.

(a) Based on its much higher normal melting point and boiling point, 
H2O has much stronger intermolecular forces. (b) H2O has hydrogen 
bonding, while H2S has dipole–dipole forces. Both molecules have 
London dispersion forces. 11.31 SO4
