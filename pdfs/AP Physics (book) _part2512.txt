FIGURE 23–7 Formation of a virtual
image by a plane mirror. Only the bundle
of rays from the top and bottom of the
object which reach the eye is shown.
Let us concentrate on the two rays that leave point A on the object in
Fig. 23–7, and strike the mirror at points B and 
We use geometry now, for the
rays at B. The angles ADB and CDB are right angles; and because of the law of
reflection,
at point B. Therefore, by geometry, angles ABD and CBD are
also equal. The two triangles ABD and CBD are thus congruent, and the length
That is, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is 
in front. The image distance,
(perpendicular distance from mirror to image,
Fig.23–7), equals the object distance,
(perpendicular distance from object to mir-
ror). From the geometry, w
