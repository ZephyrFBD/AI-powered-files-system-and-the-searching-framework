h are used to make coins and jewelry, 
are called noble metals because of their low reactivity.
The activity series can be used to predict the outcome of reactions between metals and 
either metal salts or acids. Any metal on the list can be oxidized by the ions of elements below it.

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
For example, copper is above silver in the series. Thus, copper metal is oxidized by silver 
ions:
 
Cu1s2 + 2 Ag+1aq2 ¡ Cu2+1aq2 + 2 Ag1s2 
[4.28]
The oxidation of copper to copper ions is accompanied by the reduction of silver ions to 
silver metal. The silver metal is evident on the surface of the copper wire in Figure 4.14. 
The copper(II) nitrate produces a blue color in the solution, as can be seen most clearly in 
the photograph on the right of Figure 4.14.
