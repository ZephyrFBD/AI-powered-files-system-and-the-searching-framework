esigned for a 120-V ac input will often “burn
out” if connected to a 120-V dc source. Explain. [Hint: The
resistance of the primary coil is usually very low.]
*23. How would you arrange two flat circular coils so that their
mutual inductance was (a) greatest, (b) least (without sepa-
rating them by a great distance)? Explain.
*24. Does the emf of the battery in Fig. 21–37 affect the time
needed for the LR circuit to reach (a) a given fraction of its
maximum possible current, (b) a given value of current?
Explain.
*25. In an LRC circuit, can the rms voltage across (a) an
inductor, (b) a capacitor, be greater than the rms voltage
of the ac source? Explain.
*26. Describe briefly how the frequency of the source emf affects
the impedance of (a) a pure resistance, (b) a pure capacitance,
(c) a pure inductance, (d) an LRC circuit near resonance
(R small), (e) an LRC circuit far from resonance (R small).
*27. Describe how to make the impedance in an LRC circuit a
minimum.
*28. An LRC resonant
