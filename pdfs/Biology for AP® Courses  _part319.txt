n is a protein hormone made of two peptide chains, A (21 amino acids long) and B (30
amino acids long). In each chain, primary structure is indicated by three-letter abbreviations that represent the names
of the amino acids in the order they are present. The amino acid cysteine (cys) has a sulfhydryl (SH) group as a side
chain. Two sulfhydryl groups can react in the presence of oxygen to form a disulfide (S-S) bond. Two disulfide bonds
connect the A and B chains together, and a third helps the A chain fold into the correct shape. Note that all disulfide
bonds are the same length, but are drawn different sizes for clarity.
The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene encoding the protein. A change in nucleotide
sequence of the gene’s coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to the growing polypeptide chain,
causing a change in protein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin β chain (a small portion of
