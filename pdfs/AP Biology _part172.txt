ions,
exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions are coupled. Exergonic
reactions power the endergonic ones.
METABOLISM
Metabolism is the sum of all the chemical reactions that take place in

cells. Some reactions break down molecules (catabolism); other reactions
build up molecules (anabolism). Metabolic reactions take place in a series,
or pathways, each of which serves a specific function. These multistep
pathways are controlled by enzymes and enable cells to carry out their
chemical activities with remarkable efficiency.
ENZYME-CONTROLLED REACTIONS
Enzymes do not provide energy for a reaction, and they do not enable a
reaction to occur that would not occur on its own. Enzymes orient
substrate molecules into positions that favor reactions to occur. Enzymes
serve as catalytic proteins that speed up reactions by lowering the energy
of activation, EA, the amount of energy needed to begin a reaction. In the
potential energy diagram in Figure
