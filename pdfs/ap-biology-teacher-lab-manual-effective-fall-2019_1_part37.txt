ent, such as gel boxes for electrophoresis. However, it is recognized that many 
classes do not have access to more expensive equipment, such as probes and sensors 
with computer interfaces. For labs utilizing such equipment, a lower-cost alternative is 
provided so that all students can initiate and follow through on their own investigations.

your school. Some schools have partnerships with local businesses that can help with 
laboratory equipment and materials.

The Labs at a Glance 
Although each lab investigation in this manual is unique and focuses on specific 
concepts and science practices, the formats are similar, as the labs are designed for 
clarity and consistency. As shown below, the teache
