ssel, thereby producing gas pressure.
Air is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (N2; 78.6 percent), oxygen (O2; 20.9 percent), water vapor (H2O; 0.5 percent),
and carbon dioxide (CO2; 0.04 percent). Each gas component of that mixture exerts a pressure. The pressure for an
individual gas in the mixture is the partial pressure of that gas. Approximately 21 percent of atmospheric gas is oxygen.
Carbon dioxide, however, is found in relatively small amounts, 0.04 percent. The partial pressure for oxygen is much greater
than that of carbon dioxide. The partial pressure of any gas can be calculated by:
P = (Patm)×(percent content in mixture).
Patm, the atmospheric pressure, is the sum of all of the partial pressures of the atmospheric gases added together,
Patm= PN2 + PO2 + PH2 O+ PCO2 = 760 mm Hg
× (percent content in mixture).
The pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 760 mm Hg. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is:
PO2 = (760 mm Hg) (0.21) = 160 mm Hg
