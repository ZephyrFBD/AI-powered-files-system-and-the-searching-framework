ence induced between the wing tips that are 70 m apart?
APPROACH We consider the wings to be a 70-m-long conductor moving through
the Earth’s magnetic field. We use Eq. 21–3 to get the emf.

ESTIMATE
Electromagnetic blood-flow measurement. The rate of
blood flow in our body’s vessels can be measured using the apparatus shown in
Fig. 21–13, since blood contains charged ions. Suppose that the blood vessel is
2.0 mm in diameter, the magnetic field is 0.080 T, and the measured emf is 0.10 mV
.
What is the flow velocity of the blood?
APPROACH The magnetic field 
points horizontally from left to right (N pole
toward S pole). The induced emf acts over the width
of the blood
vessel, perpendicular to 
and (Fig. 21–13), just as in Fig. 21–11. We can then
use Eq. 21–3 to get
