es, what is the pressure of carbon dioxide? Ne-
glect the volume of the liquid water that forms on cooling.
 
10.70  If 5.15 g of Ag2O is sealed in a 75.0-mL tube filled with 760 torr 
of N2  gas at 32 °C, and the tube is heated to 320 °C, the 
Ag2O decomposes to form oxygen and silver. What is the to-
tal pressure inside the tube assuming the volume of the tube 
remains constant?
   10.71 At an underwater depth of 250 ft, the pressure is 8.38 atm. 
What should the mole percent of oxygen be in the diving gas 
for the partial pressure of oxygen in the mixture to be 0.21 atm, 
the same as in air at 1 atm?
 
10.72  (a) What are the mole fractions of each component in a 
mixture of 15.08 g of O2, 8.17 g of N2, and 2.64 g of H2? (b) 
What is the partial pressure in atm of each component of 
this mixture if it is held in a 15.50-L vessel at 15 °C?
   10.73 A quantity of N2 gas originally held at 5.25 atm pressure in 
a 1.00-L container at 26 °C is transferred to a 12.5-L con-
tainer at 20 °C
