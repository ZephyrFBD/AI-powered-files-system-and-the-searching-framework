but does not alter the size or shape of the molecules. In a liquid, the molecules are packed 
closely together but still move rapidly. The rapid movement allows the molecules to slide 
over one another; thus, a liquid pours easily. In a solid the molecules are held tightly 
together, usually in definite arrangements in which the molecules can wiggle only slightly 
in their otherwise fixed positions. Thus, the distances between molecules are similar in the

and ice. We see the liquid and solid states but cannot see the gas (vapor) 
state. The red arrows show that the three states of matter interconvert.
