1. Because males inherit only one X chromosome, they express all the genes on that chromosome, regardless of
whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. In contrast, females inherit two X chromosomes and both alleles for a
gene must be recessive in order for a female to express a recessive trait.
2. Because females have two X chromosomes, they have two chances of inheriting a trait on that chromosome and
they need only one copy of a dominant allele to express the trait.
3. A trait that is produced by the expression of many interacting genes (polygenic inheritance) generates continuous
variation in a population. Also, multiple alleles of a single gene can recombine to produce many genotypic and
phenotypic combinations.
A Typical Answer to Long Question
Question 1
a. When chromosomes align (on the metaphase plate) during meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are paired. Each
homologue migrates to a separate pole and becomes a member of a separate gamete. The migration to separate poles
