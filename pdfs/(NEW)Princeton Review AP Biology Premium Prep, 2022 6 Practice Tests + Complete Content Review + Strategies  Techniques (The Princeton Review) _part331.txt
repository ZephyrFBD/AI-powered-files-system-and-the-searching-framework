DNA REPLICATION
We said in the beginning of this chapter that DNA is the hereditary blueprint of the cell. By directing the
manufacture of proteins, DNA serves as the cellâ€™s blueprint. But how is DNA inherited? For the information in
DNA to be passed on, it must first be copied. This copying of DNA is known as DNA replication.
Because the DNA molecule is twisted over on itself, the first step in replication is to unwind the double helix by
breaking the hydrogen bonds. This is accomplished by an enzyme called helicase. The exposed DNA strands now
form a y-shaped replication fork.
Now each strand can serve as a template for the synthesis of another strand. DNA replication begins at specific sites
called origins of replication. Because the DNA helix twists and rotates during DNA replication, another class of
enzymes, called
DNA topoisomerases, cuts, and rejoins the helix to prevent tangling. The enzyme that performs the actual addition
of nucleotides to the freshly built st
