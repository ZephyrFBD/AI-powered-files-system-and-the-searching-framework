 do? It helps the process along by holding everything in place while the tRNAs assist in
assembling polypeptides.
Initiation
Ribosomes contain three binding sites: an A site, a P site, and an E site. The mRNA will shuffle through from A to
P to E. As the mRNA codons are read, the polypeptide will be built. In all organisms, the start codon for the
initiation of protein synthesis is A–U–G, which codes for the amino acid methionine. Proteins can have AUGs in the
rest of the protein that code for methionine as well, but the special first AUG of an mRNA is the one that will kick
off translation. The tRNA with the complementary anticodon, U–A–C, is methionine’s personal shuttle; when the
AUG is read on the mRNA, methionine is delivered to the ribosome.
Elongation
Addition of amino acids is called elongation. Remember that the mRNA contains many codons, or “triplets,” of
nucleotide bases. As each amino acid is brought to the mRNA by tRNA molecules, it is linked to its neighboring
amino acid
