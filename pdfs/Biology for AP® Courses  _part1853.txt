eratures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by
the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the
nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-
coding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are
often less stable than DNA.
DNA and RNA Extraction
To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques
are used to extract different types of DNA (Figure 17.2). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break
open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of
unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a lysis buffer (a solution which is
mostly a detergent); lysis m
