mbers of a population are best suited to
survive and which are not, works both “internally” and “externally”: internally through random mutations and
externally through environmental pressures. Biotic and abiotic factors can fluctuate and this can affect the direction
of evolution. With each generation, different traits might be selected for depending on environmental fluctuations.
Natural selection requires genetic variation and an environmental pressure that gives some
individuals an advantage.
To see how this process unfolds in nature, let’s return to the moth case. Why did the dark moths in the north
survive? Because they were dark-colored. But how did they become dark-colored? The answer is, through random
mutation. One day, long before the coal burning, a moth was born with dark-colored wings. As long as a mutation
does not kill an organism before it reproduces (most mutations, in fact, do), it may be passed on to the next
generation. Over time, this one moth had offspring. These
