DNA gyrase. Eukaryote chromosomes are
wrapped around histone proteins that could form
heterochromatin, which is present in
prokaryotes.
41. DNA replication is bidirectional and discontinuous;
explain your understanding of those concepts.
a.
DNA polymerase reads the template strand in
the 3’ to 5’ direction and adds nucleotides only
in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The leading strand is
synthesized in the direction of the replication
fork. Replication on the lagging strand occurs in
the direction away from the replication fork in
short stretches of DNA called Okazaki
fragments.
