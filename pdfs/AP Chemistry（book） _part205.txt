hich the solutions are shown in detail. For practice exercises, we 
supply only the answer, at the back of the book. It is important that 
you use these exercises to test yourself.
The practice exercises in this text and the homework assign-
ments given by your instructor provide the minimal practice that 
you will need to succeed in your chemistry course. Only by working 
all the assigned problems will you face the full range of difficulty and 
coverage that your instructor expects you to master for exams. There 
is no substitute for a determined and perhaps lengthy effort to work 
problems on your own. If you are stuck on a problem, however, ask 
for help from your instructor, a teaching assistant, a tutor, or a fellow 
student. Spending an inordinate amount of time on a single exercise 
is rarely effective unless you know that it is particularly challenging 
and is expected to require extensive thought and effort.
