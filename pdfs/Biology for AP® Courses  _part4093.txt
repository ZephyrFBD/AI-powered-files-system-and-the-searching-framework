Will this technology become more affordable and how should it be used?
With the ability of technology to progress rapidly and unpredictably, a lack of definitive guidelines for the use
of reproductive technologies before they arise might make it difficult for legislators to keep pace once they
are in fact realized, assuming the process needs any government regulation at all. Other bioethicists argue
that we should only deal with technologies that exist now, and not in some uncertain future. They argue that
these types of procedures will always be expensive and rare, so the fears of eugenics and “master” races
are unfounded and overstated. The debate continues.
