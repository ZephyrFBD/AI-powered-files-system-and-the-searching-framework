ogical disorders. This radiation can also 
destroy unhealthy cells, however, including cancerous cells. All can-
cers are characterized by runaway cell growth that can produce malig-
nant tumors. These tumors can be caused by the exposure of healthy 
cells to high-energy radiation. Paradoxically, however, they can be 
destroyed by the same radiation that caused them because the rap-
idly reproducing cells of the tumors are very susceptible to radiation 
damage. Thus, cancerous cells are more susceptible to destruction 
by radiation than healthy ones, allowing radiation to be used effec-
tively in the treatment of cancer. As early as 1904, physicians used 
the radiation emitted by radioactive substances to treat tumors by 
destroying the mass of unhealthy tissue. The treatment of disease by 
 
high-energy radiation is called radiation therapy.
Many radionuclides are currently used in radiation therapy. 
Some of the more commonly used ones are listed in Table 21.10. Most 
of them have sh
