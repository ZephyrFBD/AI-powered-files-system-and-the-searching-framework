n”? Propose a reaction that will terminate 
the chain reaction.
 
[14.123] Many primary amines, RNH2, where R is a carbon- 
containing fragment such as CH3, CH3CH2, and so on, 
undergo reactions where the transition state is tetrahe-
dral. (a) Draw a hybrid orbital picture to visualize the 
bonding at the nitrogen in a primary amine (just use a C 
atom for “R”). (b) What kind of reactant with a primary 
amine can produce a tetrahedral intermediate?
 
[14.124] The NOx waste stream from automobile exhaust includes 
species such as NO and NO2. Catalysts that convert 
these species to N2 are desirable to reduce air pollution. 
 
(a) Draw the Lewis dot and VSEPR structures of NO, NO2, 
and N2. (b) Using a resource such as Table 8.3, look up the 
energies of the bonds in these molecules. In what region 
of the electromagnetic spectrum are these energies? (c) 
Design a spectroscopic experiment to monitor the con-
version of NOx into N2, describing what wavelengths of 
light need to be monitor
