re reality we see with the totality of reality that we don’t.
Now get this if you are new to such information: Visible light, the
only band of frequency that we can see, is a fraction of the 0.005
percent (Fig 11 overleaf). Take this further and realise that our
universe is one of inﬁnite universes and that universes are only a
fragment of overall reality – infinite reality. Then compare that with
the almost inﬁnitesimal frequency band of visible light or human
sight. You see that humans are as near blind as it is possible to be
without actually being so. Artist and ﬁlmmaker, Sergio Toporek,
said:
Figure 10: Humans can perceive such a tiny band of visual reality it’s laughable.
Figure 11: We can see a smear of the 0.005 percent electromagnetic spectrum, but we still
know it all. Yep, makes sense.
Consider that you can see less than 1% of the electromagnetic spectrum and hear less than
1% of the acoustic spectrum. 90% of the cells in your body carry their own microbial DNA
and are not ‘
