in why most organisms now use DNA
genomes rather than RNA genomes. (C) is incorrect because a number
of polymers are believed to have preceded the existence of cells and
their protobiont precursors, but which one happened to be first does
not necessarily have any impact on whether protobionts were RNA-
based or DNA-based. (D) is incorrect because the RNA world
hypothesis maintains that the first self-replicating molecules were
purely RNA-based, not requiring DNA at any point in their replication.

According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, fit individuals are
those that are able to survive and reproduce successfully, passing their

genes on to the next generation. Because the question stem says to
assume that rates of reproduction are eﬀectively equal, the only
relevant criterion for fitness will be the rate of survival. Because
mismatched females had the highest survival rate, they have the
greatest fitness, making (C) correct.
