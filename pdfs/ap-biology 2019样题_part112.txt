environment affects 
enzyme activity.
ENE-1.G.1
Environmental pH can alter the efficiency of 
enzyme activity, including through disruption of 
hydrogen bonds that provide enzyme structure.
Required Course Content 
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-1
The highly complex organization of living systems requires constant input of energy 
and the exchange of macromolecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.F
Explain how changes to the 
structure of an enzyme may 
affect its function.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.F.1
Change to the molecular structure of a 
component in an enzymatic system may result 
in a change of the function or efficiency of 
the system— 
a.  
Denaturation of an enzyme occurs when the 
protein structure is disrupted, eliminating the 
ability to catalyze reactions.
b.  
Environmental temperatures and pH outside 
the optimal range for a given enzyme will 
cause changes to its structure, altering the 
efficiency with which it catalyzes reactions. 
ENE-1.F.2
In some cases, enzyme denatur
