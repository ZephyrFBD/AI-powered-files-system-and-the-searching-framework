representation
at a particular instant in time.
Wave along a wire. A wave whose wavelength is 0.30 m
is traveling down a 300-m-long wire whose total mass is 15 kg. If the wire is under
a tension of 1000 N, what are the speed and frequency of this wave?
APPROACH We assume the velocity of this wave on a wire is given by
Eq. 11–13. We get the frequency from Eq. 11–12,
SOLUTION From Eq. 11–13, the velocity is
The frequency is
NOTE A higher tension would increase both v and f, whereas a thicker, denser
wire would reduce v and f.

Speed of Longitudinal Waves
The speed of a longitudinal wave has a form similar to that for a transverse wave
on a cord (Eq. 11–13); that is,
In particular, for a longitudinal wave traveling down a long solid rod,

where E is the elastic modulus (Section 9–5) of the material and 
is its density.
