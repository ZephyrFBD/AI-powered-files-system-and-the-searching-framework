second law,
does not change.Thus Newtons’ second law satisfies the relativity
principle. The other laws of mechanics also satisfy the relativity principle.
That the laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial reference frames
implies that no one inertial frame is special in any sense. We express this
important conclusion by saying that all inertial reference frames are equivalent
for the description of mechanical phenomena. No one inertial reference frame is
any better than another. A reference frame fixed to a car or an aircraft traveling
at constant velocity is as good as one fixed on the Earth. When you travel
smoothly at constant velocity in a car or airplane, it is just as valid to say you are
at rest and the Earth is moving as it is to say the reverse.† There is no experiment
you can do to tell which frame is “really” at rest and which is moving. Thus, there
is no way to single out one particular reference frame as being at absolute rest.
A complication arose, however, i
