(like LCDs) because they emit the light themselves.
OLEDs can be fabricated as a matrix, usually active matrix (AMOLED), using
the same type of addressing described in Section 17–11 for LCDs. OLED displays
are much thinner than LCDs and retain brightness at larger viewing angles. They
can even be fabricated on curved or flexible substrates—try the windshield of your
car (Fig. 29–39). The array may be RGBG (similar to a Bayer mosaic, Fig. 25–2)
or RGBW where 
is meant to give greater brightness. The subpixels
can also be stacked, one above the other (similar to the Foveon, Fig. 25–3).
OLED Functioning (advanced)
According to band theory, when a voltage is applied 
electrons 
are “injected” (engineering term) into energy states of the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the emissive layer. At the same time, electrons
are withdrawn from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of the
conductive layer at the cathode—which is equivalent to holes being “injected”
into the co
