n. An important step in the
breakdown of glucose to yield energy is catalysis by a multi-enzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate
dehydrogenase is a complex of several enzymes that actually requires one cofactor (a magnesium ion) and five different
organic coenzymes to catalyze its specific chemical reaction. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by an
abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which are supplied primarily by the diets of most organisms.
Figure 6.20 Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes, and are required for enzymes to function
properly. Multivitamin capsules usually contain mixtures of all the vitamins at different percentages.
Enzyme Compartmentalization
In eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles. This allows for yet
another level of regulation of enzyme activity. Enzymes required only for certain cellular processes can be housed separately
along with their
