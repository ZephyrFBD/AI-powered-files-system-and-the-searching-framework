uids and solids, we must under-
stand intermolecular forces, the forces that exist between mol-
ecules. Only by understanding the nature and strength of these 
forces can we understand how the composition and structure of 
a substance are related to its physical properties in the liquid or 
solid state.

A Molecular Comparison  
of Gases, Liquids, and Solids
As we learned in Chapter 10, the molecules in a gas are widely separated and in a 
state of constant, chaotic motion. One of the key tenets of kinetic-molecular theory 
of gases is the assumption that we can neglect the interactions between molecules. 
 (Section 10.7) The properties of liquids and solids are quite different from those of 
gases largely because the intermolecular forces in liquids and solids are much stronger. 
A comparison of the properties of gases, liquids, and solids is given in Table 11.1.
In liquids the intermolecula
