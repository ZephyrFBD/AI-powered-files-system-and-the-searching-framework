he salinity of soil, because the movement of water into and out of plant
cells depends on the solute concentration of their environment. In soil high in saline, water will be drawn out
of root cells causing the cells to shrivel, and the plant to die.

How do electrochemical gradients affect the active transport of ions and molecules across membranes?
Connection for AP® Courses
If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient, the cell must use free energy, often provided
by ATP, and carrier proteins acting as pumps to move the substance. Substances that move across membranes by this
mechanism, a process called active transport, include ions, such as Na+ and K+. The combined gradients that affect
movement of an ion are its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient (the difference in charge across the membrane);
together these gradients are called the electrochemical gradient. To mo
