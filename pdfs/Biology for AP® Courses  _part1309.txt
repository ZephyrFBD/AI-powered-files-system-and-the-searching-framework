simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F2 offspring. Therefore, the
F1 plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods.
The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms
that are homozygous at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes.
Mendelâ€™s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P1 plants
with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that
their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.
Dominant and Recessive Alleles
Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F1 heterozygous offspring were identical
to one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two
