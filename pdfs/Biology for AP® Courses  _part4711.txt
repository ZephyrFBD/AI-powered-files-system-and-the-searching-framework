ecies such as the one designated as T in the web
changes if it feeds directly on S, assuming the abundance
of species S is limited only by radiant energy input.
C. Consider the consequences of the dietary shift
described in B if the abundance of species becomes
depleted due to consumption by species T. Under those
circumstances refine your analysis of the food web to
describe the potential effect on species Q and R.
D. Based on the preceding analyses, construct a claim
regarding the effect of the structure, in terms of
biodiversity and number of interactions among species, on
