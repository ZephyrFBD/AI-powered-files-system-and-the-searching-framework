observation that deep-sea bacteria consume 
molecular hydrogen (H2) is most relevant to 
resolving which of the following apparent 
contradictions? 
(A) Water gushing from deep-sea hydrothermal 
vents can be as hot as 400âˆžC, which is a 
lethal temperature for most organisms. 
(B) Some deep-sea organisms appear to be 
primary consumers, but no plants live near 
the hydrothermal vents. 
(C) Zoarcid fish are thought to be aggressive 
predators, but they are frequently described 
as being lazy swimmers. 
(D) Some tissues of tubeworms contain 
hemoglobin, which is an oxygen-carrying 
molecule, but there is little free oxygen at 
this depth.

 8. Researchers are investigating the evolutionary 
relationships among organisms found near deep-
sea hydrothermal vents and similar organisms 
found closer to the ocean surface. Which of th
