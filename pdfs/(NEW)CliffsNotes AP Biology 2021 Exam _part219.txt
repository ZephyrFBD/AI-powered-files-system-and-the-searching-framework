 purse strings are tightened is
called a cleavage furrow.
When mitosis and cytokinesis are completed and interphase begins, the cell begins a period of growth. This growth
period is divided into three phases, designated G1, S, and G2, to distinguish special activities that occur.
Although you can associate the labels G1and G2with growth and S with
synthesis, it is important to recognize that growth takes place during all three phases. The S phase marks the time
during which the second DNA molecule for each chromosome is synthesized. As a result of this DNA replication,
each chromosome that appears at the beginning of the next
mitotic division will appear as two sister chromatids. During the G2period
 
of growth, materials for the next mitotic division are prepared. The time
 
span through mitosis and cytokinesis (M phase), through G1, S, and G2
 
(interphase), is the cell cycle (Figure 7-2).
A diploid cell is a cell with two copies of every chromosome (designated by 2n). A cell that be
