1s2 + I21s2 ยก Sn2+1aq2 + 2 I-1aq2
Under standard conditions, what is the maximum electri-
cal work, in joules, that the cell can accomplish if 75.0 g of 
Sn is consumed?
 20.60  Consider the voltaic cell illustrated in Figure 20.5, which is 
based on the cell reaction
Zn1s2 + Cu2+1aq2 ยก Zn2+1aq2 + Cu1s2
Under standard conditions, what is the maximum electri-
cal work, in joules, that the cell can accomplish if 50.0 g of 
copper is formed?

 20.61  (a) In the Nernst equation, what is the numerical value 
of the reaction quotient, Q, under standard conditions? 
(b) Can the Nernst equation be used at temperatures other 
than room temperature?
 20.62  A voltaic cell is constructed with all reactants and prod-
ucts in their standard states. Will the concentration of the 
reactants increase, decrease, or remain the same as the cell 
operates?
 20.63  What is the effect on the emf of the cell shown in Figure 
20.9, which has the overall re
