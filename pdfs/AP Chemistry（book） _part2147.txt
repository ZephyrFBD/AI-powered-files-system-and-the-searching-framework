y of the CO2 in the ex-
pired air at its peak, assuming a body temperature of 37 °C?
 13.60  Breathing air that contains 4.0  % by volume CO2 over time 
causes rapid breathing, throbbing headache, and nausea, 
among other symptoms. What is the concentration of CO2 
in such air in terms of (a) mol percentage, (b) molarity, as-
suming 1 atm pressure and a body temperature of 37 °C?
