eleased into the atmosphere.
Assuming that this radiation was distributed uniformly
over the surface of the Earth, what was the activity per
square meter? (The actual activity was not uniform; even
within Europe wet areas received more radioactivity from
rainfall.)
69. A star with a large helium abundance can burn helium in
the reaction 
What is the
Q-value for this reaction?
70. A 
source is used for 1.4 hours by a 62-kg
worker. Radioactive 
decays by 
decay with a half-
life of 30 yr. The average energy of the emitted betas is
about 190 keV per decay. The 
decay is quickly followed
by a 
with an energy of 660 keV. Assuming the person
absorbs all emitted energy, what effective dose (in rem) is
received?
71. Suppose a future fusion reactor would be able to put out
1000 MW of electrical power continuously. Assume the
reactor will produce energy solely through the reaction
given in Eq. 31â€“8a and will convert this energy to electrical
energy with an efficiency of 33%. Estimate the minimum
