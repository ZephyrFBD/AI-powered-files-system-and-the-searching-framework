rator, stopping transcription of the operon. This type of feedback mechanism allows the cell to make
the enzymes needed to synthesize tryptophan only when the cell needs them, again saving valuable resources in the
cell.

In summary, there are some key differences between inducible operons and repressible operons:
The function of the operon (catabolic or anabolic)
Whether the repressor protein can bind to the operator on its own, or whether the repressor protein needs a
corepressor to bind to the operator
For the AP Biology exam, you are not required to memorize which operons are inducible or repressible, but you do need to understand how inducible
and repressible operons work. You must be able to apply your knowledge about operons to novel scenarios. For example, if a question on the exam is
about the arabinose operon, the question will tell you the type of operon it is (inducible). Then you should apply your knowledge of how the lac
operon works to answer the qu
