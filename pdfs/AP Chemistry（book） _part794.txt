a) The fuel value of the serving will be the sum of the fuel 
values of the protein, carbohydrates, and fat. (b) Here we are faced 
with the reverse problem, calculating the quantity of food that 
provides a specific fuel value.
Plan (a) We are given the masses of the protein, carbohydrates, 
and fat contained in a serving. We can use the data in Table 5.4 to  
convert these masses to their fuel values, which we can sum to  
get the total fuel value. (b) The problem statement provides a con-
version factor between Calories and miles. The answer to part (a) 
provides us with a conversion factor between servings and Calories.
Solve
(a)  
(b)  
We can use these factors in a straightforward dimensional 
analysis to determine the number of servings needed, 
rounded to the nearest whole number:
Servings = 13 mi2a 100 Cal
1 mi
b a
1 serving
160 Cal b = 2 servings
