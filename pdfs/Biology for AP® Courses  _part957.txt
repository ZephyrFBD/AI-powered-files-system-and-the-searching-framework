and NADPH. These energy-
carrying molecules are made in the stroma where carbon fixation takes place.
The light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and
regeneration.
Stage 1: Fixation
In the stroma, in addition to CO2, two other components are present to initiate the light-independent reactions: an enzyme
called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and three molecules of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP),
as shown in Figure 8.19. RuBP has five atoms of carbon, flanked by two phosphates.

Figure 8.19 The Calvin cycle has three stages. In stage 1, the enzyme RuBisCO incorporates carbon dioxide into
an organic molecule, 3-PGA. In stage 2, the organic molecule is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH. In
stage 3, RuBP, the molecule that starts the cycle, is regenerated so that the cycle can continue. Only one carbon
dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle
