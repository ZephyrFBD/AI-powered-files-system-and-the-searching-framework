Overview
Biological macromolecules form the basis for the structure and function of living organisms. This chapter reviews
the basic reactions that form and break down these molecules. Then, the structure and function of carbohydrates,
lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins are reviewed, with special attention given to the four levels of structure found in
proteins.
Biological Macromolecules
The macromolecules necessary for life are primarily made of six elements: nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
phosphorus, and sulfur.
TIP
An easy mnemonic device to help you remember these elements is NCHOPS for Nitrogen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulfur.
Carbon is the “backbone” of these molecules. Carbon has four valence electrons and is extremely versatile in the
way it can bond to other atoms. It can form single, double, or even triple bonds. Carbon can also form l
