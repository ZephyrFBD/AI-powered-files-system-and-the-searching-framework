that is in the nucleus? (b) What is the fraction of the
hydrogen atom’s volume that is occupied by the nucleus?
11. (II) Approximately how many nucleons are there in a 
1.0-kg object? Does it matter what the object is made of?
Why or why not?

particle
have to just “touch” the surface of a 
nucleus?
