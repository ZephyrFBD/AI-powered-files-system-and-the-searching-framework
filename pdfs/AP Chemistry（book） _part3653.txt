Magnetism
The spin that an electron possesses gives the electron a magnetic 
moment, a property that causes the electron to behave like a tiny 
magnet. In a diamagnetic solid, defined as one in which all the 
electrons in the solid are paired, the spin-up and spin-down elec-
trons cancel one another. 
 (Section 9.8) Diamagnetic sub-
stances are generally described as being nonmagnetic, but when a 
diamagnetic substance is placed in a magnetic field, the motions 
of the electrons cause the substance to be very weakly repelled by 
the magnet. In other words, these supposedly nonmagnetic sub-
stances do show some very faint magnetic character in the pres-
ence of a magnetic field.
A substance in which the atoms or ions have one or more 
unpaired electrons is paramagnetic. 
 (Section 9.8) In a paramag-
netic solid, the electrons on one atom or ion do not influence the 
unpaired electrons on neighboring atoms or ions. As a result, the 
magnetic moments on the at
