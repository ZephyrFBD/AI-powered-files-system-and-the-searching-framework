 the concentration of H+ ions in
stomach acid is 10–2 M. This is pretty high when you consider the other extreme is lye, which has a pH of 14, a
concentration of H+ ions around 10–14 M! Use your calculator to double-check that these numbers are correct.
You’ll notice from the scale below that stronger acids have lower pHs. If a solution has a low concentration of
hydrogen ions, it will have a high pH.
The equation for pH is listed on the AP Biology Equations and Formulas sheet. However, you will not be expected
to perform calculations using this equation. Instead, you should understand how the equation works and when pH
calculations are useful.
ORGANIC MOLECULES
Now that we’ve discussed chemical compounds in general, let’s talk about a special group of compounds. Most of
the chemical compounds in living organisms contain a skeleton of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen atoms and
often other elements. These molecules are known as organic compounds. By contrast, molecules that do not
