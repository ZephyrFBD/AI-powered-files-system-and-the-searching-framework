5. If the two alleles inherited for a gene (each on one of the two homologous chromosomes) are different, one allele
may be dominant, while the other is recessive. The trait encoded by the dominant allele is the actual trait expressed.
In pea plants, the tall stem allele is dominant and the dwarf allele is recessive. Therefore, if a pea plant inherits one
of each of these alleles, only the dominant allele is expressed, producing tall plants. In genetics problems, a
dominant allele is often represented by a capital letter, while the recessive allele is represented by the lowercase
form of the same letter. In addition, the first letter of the dominant allele is often used to represent the gene. Thus, T
and t represent the dominant (tall) and recessive (dwarf) alleles, respectively, of the same gene. (It is easiest to read
these two alleles as “big” T and “small” t.)
