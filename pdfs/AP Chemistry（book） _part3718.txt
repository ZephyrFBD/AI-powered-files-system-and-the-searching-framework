▲ Figure 23.26 The color of 3Ti(H2O)643 +
A solution containing the 3Ti(H2O)643+ 
ion appears purple because, as its visible 
absorption spectrum shows, the solution 
does not absorb light from the violet 
and red ends of the spectrum. That 
unabsorbed light is what reaches our eyes.

▲ Figure 23.27 Metal–ligand bond 
formation. The ligand acts as a Lewis base 
by donating its nonbonding electron pair 
to an empty orbital on the metal ion. The 
bond that results is strongly polar with some 
covalent character.

In crystal-field theory, we consider the ligands to be negative points of charge that 
repel the negatively charg
