idizing agent and which is the reducing agent.
Sample Exercise 20.1 
Identifying Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a redox equation and asked to identify the 
substance oxidized and the substance reduced and to label the oxi-
dizing agent and the reducing agent.
Plan First, we use the rules outlined earlier 
 (Section 4.4) to 
assign oxidation states, or numbers, to all the atoms and deter-
mine which elements change oxidation state. Second, we apply 
the definitions of oxidation and reduction.
Solve
Cd(s)     NiO2(s)     2 H2O(l)
Ni(OH)2(s)

The oxidation state of Cd increases from 0 to +2, and that of Ni 
decreases from +4 to +2. Thus, the Cd atom is oxidized (loses 
electrons) and is the reducing agent. The oxidation state of 
Ni decreases as NiO2 is converted into Ni1OH22. Thus, NiO2 is 
reduced (gains electrons) and is the oxidizing agent.
