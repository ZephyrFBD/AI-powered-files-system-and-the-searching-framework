Heredity
HAPLOIDS VERSUS DIPLOIDS
Every organism has a certain number of unique chromosomes. For example, fruit flies have 4 chromosomes, humans
have 23 chromosomes, and dogs have 39 chromosomes. It turns out that most eukaryotic cells in fact have two full
sets of chromosomes—one set from each parent. Humans, for example, have two sets of 23 chromosomes, giving us
our grand total of 46.
A cell that has two sets of chromosomes is a diploid cell, and the zygotic chromosome number is given as “2n.”
That means we have two copies of each chromosome.
Remember that the n stands for the number of unique chromosomes.
If a cell has only one set of chromosomes, we call it a haploid cell. This kind of cell is given the symbol n. For
example, we would say that the haploid number of chromosomes fo
