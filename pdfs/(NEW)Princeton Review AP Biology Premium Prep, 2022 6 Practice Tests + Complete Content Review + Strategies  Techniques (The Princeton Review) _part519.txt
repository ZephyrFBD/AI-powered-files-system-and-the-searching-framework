ds were included in the Miller-Urey
experiment, so it was impossible to form these two amino acids under the conditions of the experiment.

Silica is a mineral form of glass, is not a common component of life-forms, and is largely chemically
inert. Since oxygen is already present in several compounds included in the experiment, the addition of
this compound does not provide any additional elements or chemical substrates, which would permit
generation of additional amino acids or synthesis of nucleic acids. The addition of sulfur compounds and
phosphorus is necessary to generate some amino acids and all nucleic acids, which eliminates (A), (C),
and (D).

Hydrolysis adds water to a polymer to break the linkages between monomers. Therefore, (A), free water,
will not result because water is being broken down in the reaction. Free water would result from the
opposite reaction, for condensation reactions. Choice (B), adenine, results from the hydrolysis of DNA, as
it is a monomer of
