i exclusion principle, no two electrons can be in
the same quantum state. At this point the star is supported against further
collapse by this electron degeneracy pressure. A white dwarf continues to lose
internal energy by radiation, decreasing in temperature and becoming dimmer
until it glows no more. It has then become a cold dark chunk of extremely dense
material.
High Mass Stars—Supernovae, Neutron Stars, Black Holes
Stars whose original mass is greater than about 8 solar masses are thought to
follow a very different scenario. A star with this great a mass can contract under
gravity and heat up even further. At temperatures 
nuclei as
heavy as 
and 
can be made. But here the formation of heavy nuclei from
lighter ones, by fusion, ends. As we saw in Fig. 30–1, the average binding energy
per nucleon begins to decrease for A greater than about 60. Further fusions
would require energy, rather than release it.
