poly-A tail (–A–A–A ... A–A-3′) is attached to the 3′ end of the mRNA (see 5 in Figure 9-5). The tail consists
of about 200 adenine nucleotides. It provides stability to the mRNA and also appears to control the movement of the
mRNA across the nuclear envelope.
3. RNA splicing removes nucleotide segments from mRNA. A transcribed DNA segment contains two kinds of
sequences—exons, which are sequences that express a code for a polypeptide, and introns, in tervening sequences
that are noncoding. The original unprocessed mRNA transcript contains both the coding and the noncoding
sequences (see 4 in Figure 9-5). Before the mRNA moves to the cytoplasm, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, or
snRNPs (pronounced “snurps”), delete the introns and splice the exons (see 6 in Figure 9-5). A snRNP consists of
small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and various proteins.
4. Alternative splicing allows different mRNAs to be generated from the same RNA transcript. By selectively
removing different parts of an RNA tran
