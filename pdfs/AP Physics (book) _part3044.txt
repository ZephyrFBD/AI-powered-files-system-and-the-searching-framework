contradicted these predictions. It was found that most of the alpha particles
passed through the foil unaffected, as if the foil were mostly empty space.
And of those deflected, a few were deflected at very large angles—some even
backward, nearly in the direction from which they had come. This could happen,
Rutherford reasoned, only if the positively charged alpha particles were being
repelled by a massive positive charge concentrated in a very small region of space
(see Fig. 27–20). He hypothesized that the atom must consist of a tiny but mas-
sive positively charged nucleus, containing over 99.9% of the mass of the atom,
surrounded by much lighter electrons some distance away. The electrons would
be moving in orbits about the nucleus—much as the planets move around the
Sun—because if they were at rest, they would fall into the nucleus due to electri-
cal attraction. See Fig. 27–21. Rutherford’s experiments suggested that the nucleus
must have a radius of about 
to
