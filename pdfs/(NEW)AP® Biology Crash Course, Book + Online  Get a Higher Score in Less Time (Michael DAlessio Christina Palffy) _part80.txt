¼ x ½ x ½ = 1/16
(c) AAbbCC = ¼ x ½ x ½ = 1/16
Example 2: Assume the following genotype: AaBBCcddEeFf.
How many different gametes are possible?
Answer: Determine how many different gametes are possible for each set of alleles.
F. Non-Mendelian Genetics—genetics that do not follow the inheritance patterns of Mendel’s initial pea
plant experiments.
1. Incomplete dominance—the phenotype of the offspring has an appearance that is between that of both
parents. This is not a blending hypothesis. The dominant allele is not fully expressed.

2. Codominance—both alleles are expressed at the same time.
i.
MN Blood system (M and N are blood group antigens found on the cell surface of a red blood
cell).
ii. There are three allelic combinations:
MM—homozygous dominant (only produce M antigen on cell surface).
MN—heterozygous (produce M and N antigens on cell surface).
NN—homozygous recessive (only produce N antigen on cell surface).
3. Multiple alleles—many different alleles can control
