39. The diagram above illustrates feedback control as 
exerted by the hormone thyroxine. Following 
surgical removal of the thyroid gland, the level of 
TSH in the blood will increase. Which of the 
following best explains this increase? 
(A) Residual blood thyroxine, from prior to 
thyroid gland removal, will bind to cells in 
the anterior pituitary, signaling more TSH 
secretion. 
(B) Thyroxine will remain bound to thyroxine 
receptors on various body cells, and these 
body cells will secrete additional hormones 
that stimulate the anterior pituitary to 
secrete TSH. 
(C) Thyroxine that was stored in the anterior 
pituitary prior to thyroid gland removal will 
signal more TSH secretion. 
(D) A decrease in thyroxine levels means a loss 
of inhibition to the hypothalamus and 
anterior pituitary, leading to increased TSH 
secretion.
