hat results in reduced uptake of 
iron into cells. Based on the data, which of the 
following is the most likely effect of HHC on 
ferritin protein levels? 
(A) Elevated levels of ferritin protein because 
there is more iron in the blood of affected 
individuals 
(B) Reduced levels of ferritin protein because 
there is less iron in the cytosol of affected 
individuals 
(C) Elevated levels of ferritin protein because 
ferritin replaces the mutant protein in 
affected individuals 
(D) Reduced levels of ferritin protein because 
iron stimulates ferritin breakdown

 The figure above shows a series of microscope images taken over time of ovalbumin production in chick oviduct 
cells in response to stimulation with estrogen. The ovalbumin protein was detected using a fluorescent dye as 
shown by the white areas in the time-lapse sequence.
