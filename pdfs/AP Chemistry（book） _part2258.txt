ed the rate-determining step (or 
rate-limiting step).
To understand the concept of the rate-determining step for a reaction, consider a 
toll road with two toll plazas (Figure 14.20). Cars enter the toll road at point 1 and pass 
through toll plaza A. They then pass an intermediate point 2 before passing through toll 
plaza B and arriving at point 3. We can envision this trip along the toll road as occurring 
in two elementary steps:
 
Step 1:
Step 2:
Overall:
 Point 1 ¡ Point 2
Point 2 ¡ Point 3
Point 1 ¡ Point 3
      
1through toll plaza A2
1through toll plaza B2
1through both toll plazas2
 
Because the experimental rate law differs from the one obtained 
by assuming a single elementary reaction, we can conclude that 
the mechanism cannot occur by a single elementary step. It must, 
therefore, involve two or more elementary steps.
(a) A + A ¡ Y + Z
(b) A ¡ X + Z
(c) A + A + B ¡ X + Y + Y
(d) B ¡ X + Y
(e) A + B ¡ X + Z
