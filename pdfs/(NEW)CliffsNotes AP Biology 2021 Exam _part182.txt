The remainder of this chapter focuses on how a signal, once recognized by a cell, actually manifests a change in the
cell. The mechanism for this process is a signal transduction pathway.
Signal Transduction Pathways
A signal transduction pathway is a sequence of molecular interactions that transforms an extracellular signal into a
specific cellular response. The process can be summarized like this:
Signal (1st messenger) → Receptor → Proteins or other 2nd messengers → Cellular responses
Signaling molecules , or ligands, are first messengers. They are small molecules that bind to larger receptor
proteins of specific target cells. When the specific ligand binds to a receptor protein, it induces a change in the
threedimensional shape of the receptor protein. That change initiates some kind of activity in the receptor protein.
There are two types of signaling molecules:
Hydrophilic ligands are signaling molecules that cannot cross the ph
