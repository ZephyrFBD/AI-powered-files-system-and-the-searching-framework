r a distance, we used the idea
of a field. The force that one charged particle exerts on a second can be said to be
due to the electric field set up by the first. Similarly, the magnetic field can be
said to carry the magnetic force. Later (Chapter 22), we saw that electromagnetic
(EM) fields can travel through space as waves. Finally, in Chapter 27, we saw that
electromagnetic radiation (light) can be considered as either a wave or as a
collection of particles called photons. Because of this wave–particle duality, it is
possible to imagine that the electromagnetic force between charged particles is
due to
(1) the EM field set up by one charged particle and felt by the other, or
(2) an exchange of photons (
particles) between them.
It is (2) that we want to concentrate on here, and a crude analogy for how an
exchange of particles could give rise to a force is suggested in Fig. 32–7. In part (a),
