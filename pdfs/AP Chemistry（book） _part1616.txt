the cylinder walls is the same for both cylinders (d) The gas 
pressure is the same in both cylinders
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
How is the rms speed of N2 molecules in a gas sample changed 
by (a) an increase in temperature, (b) an increase in volume, 
(c) mixing with a sample of Ar at the same temperature?

energy of the molecules and in urms. Because there is no change in volume, the 
temperature increase causes more collisions with the walls per unit time because 
the molecules are all moving faster. Furthermore, the momentum in each colli-
sion increases (the molecules strike the walls more forcefully). A greater number 
of more forceful collisions means the pressure increases, and the theory explains 
this increase.
