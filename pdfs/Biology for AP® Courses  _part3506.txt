der voluntary control,
has only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called involuntary muscle.
Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain
blood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be
consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle. It has one nucleus per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the
presence of intercalated disks.
Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure
Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 µm and
lengths of up to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma. The sarcolemma is
the site of action potential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction. Within each muscle fiber are myofibrils—long
cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run the entire length of t
