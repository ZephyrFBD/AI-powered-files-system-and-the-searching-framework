ber, ml, 
were to change? (i) It would be 
drawn larger, (ii) the number of lobes would change, (iii) the 
lobes of the orbital would point in a different direction, (iv) 
there would be no change in the sketch. [Section 6.6]
 6.10  The 
accompanying 
drawing 
shows a contour plot for a dyz 
orbital. Consider the quantum 
numbers that could potentially 
correspond to this orbital. (a) 
What is the smallest possible 
value of the principal quantum 
number, n? (b) What is the val-
ue of the angular momentum 
quantum number, l? (c) What is 
the largest possible value of the 
magnetic quantum number, ml? 
 
(d) The probability density goes to zero along which of the 
following planes: xy, xz, or yz?
 6.11  Four possible electron conﬁgurations for a nitrogen atom are 
shown below, but only one schematic represents the cor-
rect conﬁguration for a nitrogen atom in its ground state. 
Which one is the correct electron conﬁguration? Which 
conﬁgurations violate the Pauli exclusion principle?
