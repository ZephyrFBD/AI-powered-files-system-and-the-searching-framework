c, as
you may already know, is a convenient device for remembering something.
For example, one important issue in biology is taxonomy—that is, the classification of life-forms, or organisms.
Organisms are classified in a descending system of similarity, leading from domains (the broadest level) to species
(the most specific level). The complete order runs as follows: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus,
and species. Don’t freak out yet. Use a mnemonic to help you:
King Philip of Germany decided to walk to America. What do you think happened?

Mnemonics can be as goofy as you like, as long as they help you remember. Throughout this book, we’ll give you
mnemonics for many of the complicated terms we’ll be seeing. Use ours, if you like them, or feel free to invent your
own. Be creative! Remember: the i
