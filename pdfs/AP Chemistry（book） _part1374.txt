lectron domain. Thus, 
the following resonance structure for O3 has three electron domains around the central 
oxygen atom (a single bond, a double bond, and a nonbonding pair of electrons):
O
O
O
In general, each nonbonding pair, single bond, or multiple bond produces a single electron 
domain around the central atom in a molecule.
The VSEPR model is based on the idea that electron domains are negatively charged 
and therefore repel one another. Like the balloons in Figure 9.5, electron domains try to 
stay out of one anotherâ€™s way. 
The best arrangement of a given number of electron domains is the one that  
minimizes the repulsions among them.
In fact, the analogy between electron domains and balloons is so close that the same 
preferred geometries are found in both cases. Like the balloons in Figure 9.5, two electron 
domains orient linearly, three domains orient in a trigonal-planar fashion, and four orient 
tetrahedrally. These arrangements, together with those for five- and six-
