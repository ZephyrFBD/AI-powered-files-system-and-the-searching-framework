3. A 28.4-kg solid aluminum cylindrical wheel of radius 
0.41 m is rotating about its axle in frictionless bearings with
angular velocity
If its temperature is then
raised from 15.0°C to 95.0°C, what is the fractional change
in
4. A hot-air balloon achieves its buoyant lift by heating 
the air inside the balloon, which makes it less dense than 
the air outside. Suppose the volume of a balloon is 
and the required lift is 3300 N (rough estimate of the weight
of the equipment and passenger). Calculate the tempera-
ture of the air inside the balloon which will produce the
required lift. Assume the outside air is an ideal gas at 0°C.
What factors limit the maximum altitude attainable by this
method for a given load? [Hint: See Chapter 10.]
1800 m3

5. Estimate how many molecules of air are in each 2.0-L
breath you inhale that were also in the last breath Galileo
took. Assume the atmosphere is about 10 km high and of
constant densit
