122. A typical human lymphocyte has a radius of 
about 10 µm, while a typical bacterium (e.g., 
S. pneumoniae) has a radius of about 1 µm. 
Assuming that both cell types are perfectly 
spherical, how many times larger is the surface 
area of a typical human lymphocyte compared to 
the surface area of a typical bacterium?

123. One method for predicting the average 
temperature (in ºC) at which a short DNA 
molecule binds with its complement is to 
calculate a melting temperature (Tm) using the 
following formula. 
Tm = 4 (G + C) + 2 (A + T) 
Using the formula, what is the predicted Tm for  
the short single-stranded DNA molecule shown 
above?

124. As part of a study to observe the activity of photosynthetic 
organisms in a temperate-zone lake, measurements of light 
penetration were made at different water depths.
