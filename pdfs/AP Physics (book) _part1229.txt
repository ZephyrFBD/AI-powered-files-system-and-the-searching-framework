ve interference (maximum amplitude
of vibration) are called antinodes.
[ Waves change direction, or refract, when traveling from
one medium into a second medium where their speed is different.
Waves spread, or diffract, as they travel and encounter obstacles.
A rough guide to the amount of diffraction is
where 
is the wavelength and the width of an obstacle or opening.
There is a significant “shadow region” only if the wavelength 
is smaller than the size of the obstacle.]
[ A traveling wave can be represented mathematically as

y = A sin E(2pl)(x & vt)F.

1. Is the acceleration of a simple harmonic oscillator ever
zero? If so, where?
2. Real springs have mass. Will the true period and frequency
be larger or smaller than given by the equations for a mass
oscillating on the end of an idealized massless spring?
Explain.
3. How could you double the maximum speed of a simple
harmonic oscillator (SHO)?
4. If a pendulum clock is accurate at sea level, will it gain or
