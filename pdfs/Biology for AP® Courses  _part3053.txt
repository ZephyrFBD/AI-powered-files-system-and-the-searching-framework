 impulse from one neuron to another or to another type of cell such as a muscle cell occurs across
a junction called a synapse. Synaptic vesicles at the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron release chemical messengers
called neurotransmitters into the junction; neurotransmitters then bind to receptors embedded in the membrane of the
postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitters may be either excitatory (such as acetylcholine or epinephrine) or inhibitory (such
as serotonin or GABA) as they either increase or decrease the change of an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.
Many drugs, including both pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse, can induce changes in synaptic transmission; for example,
tetrahydrocannabinol (more commonly known as THC) in marijuana binds to a naturally occurring neurotransmitter
