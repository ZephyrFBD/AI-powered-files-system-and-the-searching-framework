secretion of FSH and LH into the bloodstream. Ca+2
concentrations oscillate in time, changing the electric
membrane potential of the GnRH neurons, GEN. The
period of the oscillation is only a few seconds in duration.
The mechanism controlling the oscillating membrane
potential is unknown, but during maturation the frequency
of the oscillations of the Ca+2 concentration in the GEN
increases.
A. Explain how the absence of direct contact among the
GnRH neurons and the coordinated release of FSH and LH
suggest another timing mechanism.
An association of high concentrations of anti-Mullerian
hormone (AMH) and elevated LH levels among women
with a common reproductive disorder called polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS) caused investigators to study the
effects of AMH on mem
