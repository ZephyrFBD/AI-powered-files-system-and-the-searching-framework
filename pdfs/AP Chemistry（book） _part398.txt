mber of  
atoms is obtained by multiplying each subscript in a chemical formula by 
the coefficient for the formula. Because there are four H atoms and two O atoms on each 
side of the equation, the equation is balanced.
▲ Figure 3.1 Antoine Lavoisier (1734–
1794). The science career of Lavoisier, 
who conducted many important studies on 
combustion reactions, was cut short by the 
French Revolution. Guillotined in 1794 
during the Reign of Terror, he is generally 
considered the father of modern chemistry 
because he conducted carefully controlled 
experiments and used quantitative 
measurements.

Balancing Equations
Chemists write unbalanced equations all the time in order to identify the reactants and 
products in a reaction. But to determine the amount of product that can be made, or the 
amount of a reactant
