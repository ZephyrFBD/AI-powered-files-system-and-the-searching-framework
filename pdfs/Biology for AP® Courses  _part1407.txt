 below the dotted diagonal line, identify with an X
each cell where deviations from the law or laws identified
in part B might be expected.

D. Explain the reasons for the expected deviations for
those combinations of characteristics identified in part C.
E. In one of the experiments reported by Mendel,
deviations from the law identified in part B might be
expected. Explain how the outcomes of this experiment
were consistent with Mendel’s laws.

parental types AaBb and AaBb can be represented with a

This representation clearly organizes all of the possible
genotypes and reveals the 9:3:3:1 distribution of
phenotypes and a 4×4 grid of 16 cells. Expressed as a
fraction of the 16 possible genotypes of the offspring, the
phenotypic ratio describes the probability of eac
