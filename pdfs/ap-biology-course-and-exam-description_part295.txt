students graph the data (or 
give them a graph), and ask 
them to make a prediction 
about what might happen 
if one of the environmental 
factors changed or if 
something about the 
experimental group changed.

Science Practice 6: Develop and justify scientific arguments  
using evidence.
Students should be able to write and evaluate scientific 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Essential skills include 
the ability to analyze, interpret, and make predictions 
from a model or the data obtained in an experiment and 
the ability to justify the reasoning for a prediction and/
or explanation. For example, when given a sequence 
of DNA containing a designated mutational change, 
students can predict the effect of the mutation on the 
encoded polypeptide and propose a possible resulting 
phenotype. Students can also evaluate the mer
