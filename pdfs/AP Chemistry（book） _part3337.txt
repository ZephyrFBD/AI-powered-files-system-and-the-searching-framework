ter (a device that measures 
electrical current) that is based on the electrolysis of water 
into hydrogen and oxygen gases. When electrical current 
of unknown magnitude is run through the device for 2.00 
min, 12.3 mL of water-saturated H21g2 is collected. The 
temperature of the system is 25.5 Â°C, and the atmospheric 
pressure is 768 torr. What is the magnitude of the current in 
amperes?
design an Experiment
You are asked to construct a voltaic cell that would simulate an al-
kaline battery by providing an electrical output of 1.50 V at the be-
ginning of its discharge. After you complete it, your voltaic cell will 
be used to power an external device that draws a constant current 
of 0.50 amperes for 2.0 hours. You are given the following supplies: 
electrodes of each transition metal from manganese to zinc, the 
chloride salts of the +2 transition metal ions from Mn2+ to Zn2+ 
(MnCl2, FeCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, and ZnCl2), two 100 mL bea-
kers, a salt bridge, a voltmeter, and wi
