herb layers is 13,000 + 1,100 KJ/m2. Subtracting this amount from the total of 19,000 KJ/
m2 leaves 4,900 KJ/m2 energy accumulated as biomass (“tied up”) in the shrub layer. This 
percentage of the total can be calculated as 4,900 KJ/m2 /19,000 KJ/m2 = .257 or 
25.7 percent.
Question 4
Essential Knowledge
1.A.1: Natural selection is a major mechanism  
of evolution. 
Science Practice
2.2: The student can apply mathematical routines to 
quantities that describe natural phenomena.
Learning Objective 
1.1: The student is able to convert a data set from a table 
of numbers that reflects a change in the genetic makeup of 
a population over time and apply mathematical methods 
and conceptual understandings to investigate the cause(s) 
and effect(s) of this change.
The correct answer for the frequency of the green allele is 0.34–0.35. After the drought, 
the frequency of the recessive phenotype, q2, was 0.12. Since the population is now in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of allele
