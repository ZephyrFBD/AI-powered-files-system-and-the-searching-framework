f the
reaction without the enzyme. Choice (D) represents the difference in free energy between the transition state of
the reaction without the enzyme and the products of the reaction and is therefore incorrect.
6. (C) The activation energy in the absence of an enzyme is the difference in free energy between the reactants
and the transition state of the higher activation energy. Choice (A) is incorrect because it represents the overall
free energy change of the reaction. Choice (B) is incorrect because it represents the activation energy of an
enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Choice (D) represents the difference in free energy between the transition state of
the reaction without the enzyme and the products of the reaction and is therefore incorrect.
7. (A) The overall free energy change of the reaction is the difference between the free energy of the products less
the free energy of the reactants. Choice (B) is incorrect because it represents the activation energy of an
enzyme-catalyzed reac
