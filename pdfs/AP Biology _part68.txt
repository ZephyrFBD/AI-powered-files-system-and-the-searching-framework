 The fact that it does not vary is an
example of homeostasis. A pH of 7.4 is slightly basic or alkaline.
That means it has more OH− ions than H+ ions. (ENE-1)
(D) Isomers have the same number of atoms of each element; they
vary only in the arrangement of those elements. Choice B is not
correct because that is an empirical formula, not a molecular
formula. However, choice B is the empirical formula for any
monosaccharide. (SYI-1)
(B) Glycogen is a polysaccharide that stores sugars in the liver and
skeletal muscle. Glucose is not stored; it is produced and used up
constantly. Glycerol and fatty acids make up lipids. Glucagon is a
hormone that is responsible for breaking down glycogen into
glucose. Glycine is the simplest amino acid. (SYI-1)
(C) The high specific heat of the water of the Pacific Ocean exerts an
effect on land temperatures. It moderates them. (SYI-1)
