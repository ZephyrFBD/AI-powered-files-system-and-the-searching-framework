en the ligand is a neutral molecule, as in the case of 
H2O or NH3, the negative ends of these polar molecules, which contain an unshared elec-
tron pair, are directed toward the metal ion. In this case, the attractive interaction is of the 
ion–dipole type. 
 (Section 11.2) In either case, the ligands are attracted strongly toward 
the metal ion. Because of the metal–ligand electrostatic attraction, the energy of the com-
plex is lower than the combined energy of the separated metal ion and ligands.
Although the metal ion is attracted to the ligand electrons, the metal ion’s d elec-
trons are repulsed by the ligands. Let’s examine this effect more closely, specifically the 
case in which the ligands form an octahedral array around a metal ion that has coordina-
tion number 6.
*The name crystal-field arose because the theory was first developed to explain the properties of 
solid crystalline materials. The theory applies equally well to complexes in solution, however.
