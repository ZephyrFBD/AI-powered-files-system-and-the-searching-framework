duction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells
because of the thick plant cell wall.
Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their
choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-
inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into
the infected plant cellâ€™s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the
desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection
and can be propagated in E. coli cells as well.
The Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect
species that affect plants. Bt toxin has to be ingested by insec
