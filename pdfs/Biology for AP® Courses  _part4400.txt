ortion of older individuals. Other developed countries, such as Italy, have zero population
growth. The age structure of these populations is more conical, with an even greater percentage of middle-aged and older
individuals. The actual growth rates in different countries are shown in Figure 36.18, with the highest rates tending to be in
the less economically developed countries of Africa and Asia.
Figure 36.17 Typical age structure diagrams are shown. The rapid growth diagram narrows to a point, indicating
that the number of individuals decreases rapidly with age. In the slow growth model, the number of individuals
decreases steadily with age. Stable population diagrams are rounded on the top, showing that the number of
individuals per age group decreases gradually, and then increases for the older part of the population.
Compare the age structure for Stage 4 to that of Stage 3. What changes in population growth would have to occur for
a shift from Stage 3 to Stage 4?
