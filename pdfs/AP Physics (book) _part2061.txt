transformed, which is related to the light produced, is 
so the greater
current in (2) means more light is produced.
(b) Headlights are wired in parallel (2), because if one bulb goes out, the other bulb
can stay lit. If they were in series (1), when one bulb burned out (the filament broke),
the circuit would be open and no current would flow, so neither bulb would light.
EXERCISE B Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 526, and answer it
again now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
P = IV,
I = VReq
AReq = R + R = 2RB.
(= R2)
Req = R2.
1Req = 1R + 1R = 2R.
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 19;2
â€ An analogy may help. Consider two identical pipes taking in water near the top of a dam and releas-
ing it at the bottom as shown in the figure to the right. If both pipes are open, rather than only one,
twice as much water will flow through. That is, the net resistance to the flow of water will be reduced
by half with two equal pipes open, just as for
