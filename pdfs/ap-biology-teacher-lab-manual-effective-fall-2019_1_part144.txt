More than one condition of an experiment may be shown on a graph using different 
lines. For example, you can compare the appearance of a product in an enzyme reaction 
at different temperatures on the same graph. In this case, each line must be clearly 
differentiated from the others â€” by a label, a different style, or color indicated by a key. 
These techniques provide an easy way to compare the results of your experiments. 
Be clear as to whether your data start at the origin (0,0) or not. Do not extend your 
line to the origin if your data do not start there. In addition, do not extend your line 
beyond your last data point (extrapolation) unless you clearly indicate by a dashed line 
(or some other demarcation) that this is your prediction about what may happen.

Graphs.
