 gene splicing increase or decrease the flexibility of gene expression? Explain your answer.
a.
Flexibility increases because mRNA can be altered after transcription is completed.
b.
Flexibility increases because genes can be divided and recombined into new genes.
c.
Flexibility decreases because the mRNA molecule becomes smaller.
d.
Flexibility decreases because DNA is degraded during alternative splicing.

Several human diseases are caused by an error in mRNA splicing. Explain why this occurs.
a.
Once an mRNA is spliced, the original mRNA cannot be created again.
b.
Spliced RNA cannot produce proper proteins.
c.
Splicing does not occur at all.
d.
Splicing occurs in the wrong location on mRNA.
