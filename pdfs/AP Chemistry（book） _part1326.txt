is the distance that separates cations 
and anions. (a) The lattice energies of NaCl and KF are given 
in Table 8.1. Based on the lattice energies, would you expect 
the Na ¬Cl or the K ¬ F distance to be longer? (b) Use the 
ionic radii given in Figure 7.8 to estimate the Na ¬ Cl and 
K ¬ F distances.
 8.23 The substances NaF and CaO are isoelectronic (have the 
same number of valence electrons). (a) What are the charges 
on each of the cations in each compound? (b) What are the 
charges of each of the anions in each compound? (c) Without 
looking up lattice energies, which compound is predicted to 
have the larger lattice energy? (d) Using the lattice energies 
in Table 8.1, predict the lattice energy of ScN.
 8.24 (a) Does the lattice energy of an ionic solid increase or decrease 
(i) as the charges of the ions increase, (ii) as the sizes of the ions 
increase? (b) Arrange the following substances not listed in 
 
Table 8.1 according to their expected lattice energies, listing them
