sm interact to express physical characteristics such as pea color in plants
or hairline appearance in humans. The observable traits of an organism are referred to as its phenotype. The organism’s
underlying genetic makeup, i.e., the combination of alleles, is called its genotype. When diploid organisms carry the same
alleles for a given trait, they are said to be homozygous for the genotype; when they carry different alleles, they are said
to be heterozygous. For a gene whose expression is Mendelian (Section 12.1), homozygous dominant and heterozygous
organisms will look identical; that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype. The recessive allele will
only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals.
However, alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns. In other words, there are exceptions to
Mendel’s model of inheritance. For example, incomplete dominance describes situation in which the heterozygote exhibits
a phenotype that is intermedi
