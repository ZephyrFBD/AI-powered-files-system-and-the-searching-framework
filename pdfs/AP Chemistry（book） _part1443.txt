Further, because this bonding MO concentrates electron density 
between the nuclei, it holds the atoms together in a covalent bond.
By contrast, the antibonding MO has very little electron density between the nuclei. 
Instead of combining in the region between the nuclei, the atomic orbital wave functions 
cancel each other in this region, leaving the greatest electron density on opposite sides 
of the two nuclei. Thus, an antibonding MO excludes electrons from the very region in 
which a bond must be formed. Antibonding orbitals invariably have a plane in the region 
between the nuclei where the electron density is zero. This plane is called a nodal plane 
of the MO. (The nodal plane is shown as a dashed line in Figure 9.31 and subsequent fig-
ures.) An electron in an antibonding MO is repelled from the bonding region and is there-
fore less stable (it has higher energy) than it is in the 1s atomic orbital of a hydrogen atom.
Notice from Figure 9.31 that the electron density in both t
