nges in the photoperiod, plants maintain a circadian rhythm, a clock that measures the length of
daylight and night. The mechanism is endogenous; that is, it is an internal clock that continues to keep time
(although less accurately) even if external cues are absent. External cues, such as dawn and dusk, reset the clock to
maintain accuracy.
The mechanism for maintaining the circadian rhythm is not completely understood. The light-absorbing protein
phytochrome is involved. There
are two forms of phytochrome, Pr and Pfr. The two forms are photoreversible: When Pris exposed to red light
(wavelength 660 nm), it is converted to Pfr;when Pfris exposed to far-red light (730 nm), it is converted back to Pr.
The following observations have been made for many
plants:
 
1. Pr is the form of phytochrome synthesized in plant cells. It is
 
synthesized in the cytoplasm.
 
2. Pfr is the active form of phytochrome.
3. Pfr accumulates during daylight. This occurs because Pr is converted to Pfr by expo
