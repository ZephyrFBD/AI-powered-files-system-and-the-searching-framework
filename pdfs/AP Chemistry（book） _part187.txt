Sample Exercise 1.8
Determining the Number of Significant Figures in a Calculated Quantity
The width, length, and height of a small box are 15.5, 27.3, and 5.4 cm, respectively. Calculate the volume of the box,  
using the correct number of significant figures in your answer.
SOLUTION
In reporting the volume, we can show only as many significant 
figures as given in the dimension with the fewest significant fig-
ures, which is that for the height (two significant figures):
 Volume = width * length * height
 = 115.5 cm2127.3 cm215.4 cm2
 = 2285.01 cm3 1 2.3 * 103 cm3
A calculator used for this calculation shows 2285.01, which we 
must round off to two significant figures. Because the resulting 
number is 2300, it is best reported in exponential notation, 
2.3 * 103, to clearly indicate two significant figures.
