[18.2]
The asterisk on O3 denotes that the product contains an excess of energy, because the re-
action is exothermic. The 105 kJ/mol that is released must be transferred away from the 
O3* molecule quickly or else the molecule will fly apart into O2 and atomic O—a decom-
position that is the reverse of the reaction by which O3* is formed.
An energy-rich O3* molecule can release its excess energy by colliding with another 
atom or molecule and transferring some of the excess energy to it. Let’s use M to repre-
sent the atom or molecule with which O3* collides. (Usually, M is N2 or O2 because these 
are the most abundant molecules in the atmosphere.) The formation of O3* and the 
transfer of excess energy to M are summarized by the equations
