g objectives from the AP Biology Curriculum Framework, as 
indicated below. 
 Enduring Understandings
■
• ENE-3: Timing and coordination of biological mechanisms involved in growth, 
reproduction, and homeostasis depend on organisms responding to environmental 
cues.
• IST-5: Transmission of information results in changes within and between biological 
systems.
• SYI-1: Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact.
 
■Learning Objectives
• ENE-3.D: Explain how the behavioral and/or physiological response of an organism is 
related to changes in internal or external environment.
• IST-5.A: Explain how the behavioral responses of organisms affect their overall fitness 
and may contribute to the success of the population.  
• SYI-1.H: Explain how the density of a population affects and is determined by 
resource availability in the environment.
