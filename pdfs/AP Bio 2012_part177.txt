 of the electron transport chain and its associated 
proteins with the production of ATP and NADPH in the 
light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The student 
is able to predict consequences of a viral infection that 
disrupts the ETS in cells and justifies those predictions even 
though the question does not specifically ask for justification. 
For example, the student might say that because the 
light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) require ATP 
and NADPH generated in the ETS of the light-dependent 
reactions, if one of the ETS proteins is disrupted by a 
virus, production of ATP and/or NADPH decreases and 
the cells will be unable to fix carbon into G3P
. In turn, 
cellular respiration, which depends on carbohydrate 
produced in the Calvin cycle, likely decreases. The student 
is able to make connections between concepts â€” in 
this case, the interdependency of the light-dependent 
and light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, and 
photosynthesis and cellular respirat
