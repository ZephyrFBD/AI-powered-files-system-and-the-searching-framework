ce the chance of skidding. The normal force
exerted by a banked road, acting perpendicular to the road, will have a compo-
nent toward the center of the circle (Fig. 5–14), thus reducing the reliance on
friction. For a given banking angle 
there will be one speed for which no friction
at all is required. This will be the case when the horizontal component of the
normal force toward the center of the curve,
(see Fig. 5–14), is just 
equal to the force required to give a vehicle its centripetal acceleration—that is,
when
[no friction required]
The banking angle of a road,
is chosen so that this condition holds for a partic-
ular speed, called the “design speed.”
