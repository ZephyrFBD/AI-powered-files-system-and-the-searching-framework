 Krebs cycle.
Each molecule of glucose that enters glycolysis will generate two molecules of pyruvate, so the oxidation of
pyruvate will occur twice for each molecule of glucose that entered glycolysis. Figure 9.2 and Table 9.3 summarize
the location, inputs, and outputs of the oxidation of pyruvate.

Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)
The Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) occurs in the matrix (the liquid center) of the mitochondria.
Coenzyme A brings the two-carbon acetyl group to the Krebs cycle, where it is initially attached to a four-carbon
intermediate, forming a six-carbon molecule. This six-carbon molecule goes through a series of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions, during which two more carbon dioxide molecules are released and the four-carbon intermediate is
regenerated. At the completion of the cycle, al
