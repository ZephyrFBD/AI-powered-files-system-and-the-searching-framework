m that cross, then the male would have contributed a spotted allele. Choice (B)
describes a male that is homozygous for the spot allele, so it’s incorrect. Choice (A), stop breeding Speckle, is
a way to remove spots from the line, but it will not help you identify males with the spot allele. Choice (D)
also will not help you determine which black Labrador males have a spot allele.

A
Choice (B) does not apply to this question. Choices (C) and (D) refer to a gene not following Mendel’s Law of
Dominance. Choice (A)—genes are linked on the same chromosome—describes a normal reason that certain
traits would not follow Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment.
10. A
Choices (B) and (C) are unlikely to be true and can be eliminated. Choice (D) is true but does not answer the
question. Choice (A) is the easiest and most probable explanation.
