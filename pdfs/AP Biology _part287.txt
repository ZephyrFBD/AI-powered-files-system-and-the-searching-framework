 by single genes and can
be accounted for by Mendel’s laws: Laws of Dominance,
Segregation, and Independent Assortment. Segregation and
independent assortment of genes apply only to genes on different
chromosomes and result in genetic variation in offspring.
Be aware that the inheritance pattern of many traits cannot be
predicted by Mendel’s laws. Examples include incomplete
dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, genomic imprinting,
and genes in mitochondria, which are inherited from only the
mother. In addition, polygenic inheritance—which are traits that
span a range of characteristics along a continuum like height, hair
color, and skin color in humans—result from the influence of
multiple genes.
Mutations are random changes in the genome. Some occur in
genes and cause human diseases like PKU, cystic fibrosis, Tay-
Sachs disease, Huntington’s disease, hemophilia, and sickle cell
disease. Some mutations, like nondisjunction, relate not to genes
but to chromosomal mutations. They ar
