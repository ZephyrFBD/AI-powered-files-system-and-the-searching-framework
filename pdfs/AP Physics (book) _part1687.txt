(c) 80%.
(d) 90%.
(e) Nearly 100%.
11. Which statement is true regarding the entropy change of
an ice cube that melts?
(a) Since melting occurs at the melting point temperature,
there is no temperature change so there is no entropy
change.
(b) Entropy increases.
(c) Entropy decreases.
6. An ideal gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion, a process in
which no heat flows into or out of the gas. As a result,
(a) the temperature of the gas remains constant and the
pressure decreases.
(b) both the temperature and pressure of the gas decrease.
(c) the temperature of the gas decreases and the pressure
increases.
(d) both the temperature and volume of the gas increase.
(e) both the temperature and pressure of the gas increase.
