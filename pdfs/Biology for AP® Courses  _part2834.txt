Cartilage
Cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers. The cells, called
chondrocytes, make the matrix and fibers of the tissue. Chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae.
A cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage, illustrated in Figure 24.14. The lacunae are randomly
scattered throughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with routine histological stains.
Sharks have cartilaginous skeletons, as does nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental
stage. A re
