prokaryotic cells perform highly-regulated gene
expression.
25. Which statement is correct regarding the distinction
between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?
a.
Prokaryotes regulate gene expression at the level
of transcription whereas eukaryotes regulate at
multiple levels including epigenetic,
transcriptional and translational.
b.
Prokaryotes regulate gene expression at the level
of translation whereas eukaryotes regulate at the
level of transcription to manipulate protein
levels.
c.
Prokaryotes regulate gene expression with the
help of repressors and activators whereas
eukaryotes regulate expression by degrading
mRNA transcripts, thereby controlling protein
levels.
d.
Prokaryotes control protein levels using
epigenetic modifications whereas eukaryotes
control protein levels by regulating the rate of
transcription and translation.

However, during development, some cells develop into
skin cells while others develop i
