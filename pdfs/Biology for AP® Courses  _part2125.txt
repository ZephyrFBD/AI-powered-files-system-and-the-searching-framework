sing the ABO blood type system as an example, the
frequency of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the
population. For example, a study in Jordan
[3] found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent. The IB and I0 alleles made up 13.4
percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this
frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.
The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles
become more widespread than others during the process of natural selection. Natural selection can alter the populationâ€™s
genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more
offspring. Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype,
they will have more off
