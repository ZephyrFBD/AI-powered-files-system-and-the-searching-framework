PARATELY
Unless one part specifically references an earlier one, treat each part as its own question. This shouldn’t be difficult
to remember. Each part should already have its own space in which to write or draw a response, and if not, you can
feel free to break between parts by inserting headers—Part A, Part B, etc.
The key here is to make sure you answer as many parts as you can, and to not get bogged down in any one part,
because each part has a maximum value. For the first two long questions, you can score at most 4 points for a part
(and if this is the case, the others will be worth 1 to 2 points). For the four short questions, each is worth a single
point. Ask yourself: is the extra point you might be able to squeak out of a long response worth the individual points
you’ll miss out on elsewhere if you run out of time on the short responses?
You don’t need a perfectly written response to get the maximum number of points, either, so don’t waste your time
with fancy introductions l
