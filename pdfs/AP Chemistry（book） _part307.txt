e atoms are represented by their chemical symbols, and lines are used to represent the 
bonds that hold the atoms together.

CHAPTER 2 Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
A structural formula does not typically depict the actual geometry of the molecule, 
that is, the actual angles at which atoms are joined; for that, more sophisticated repre-
sentations are needed (Figure  2.18).

Perspective drawings use wedges and dashed lines to depict bonds that are not 
in the plane of the paper. This gives a crude sense of the three-dimensional shape 
of a molecule.

Ball-and-stick models show atoms as spheres and bonds as sticks. This type of 
model has the  
advantage of accurately representing the angles at which the atoms 
are attached to one another in a molecule (Figure 2.18). Sometimes the chemical 
symbols of the elements are superimposed on the balls, but often the atoms are 
identified simply by color.

Space-filling models depict what a molecule would look like if the atoms were
