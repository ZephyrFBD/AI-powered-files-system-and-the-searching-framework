Galileo’s specific contribution to our understanding of the motion of falling
objects can be summarized as follows:
at a given location on the Earth and in the absence of air resistance, all
objects fall with the same constant acceleration.
We call this acceleration the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the
Earth, and we give it the symbol g. Its magnitude is approximately
In British units g is about 
Actually, g varies slightly according to lati-
tude and elevation on the Earth’s surface, but these variations are so small that
we will ignore them for most purposes. (Acceleration of gravity in space beyond
the Earth’s surface is treated in Chapter 5.) The effects of air resistance are
often small, and we will neglect them for the most part. However, air resistance
will be noticeable even on a
