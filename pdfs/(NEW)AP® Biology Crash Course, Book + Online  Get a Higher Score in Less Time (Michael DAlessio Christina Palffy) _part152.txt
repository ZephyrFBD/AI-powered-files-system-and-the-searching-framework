increases.
Poisoning due to accumulating waste materials becomes more likely, and affects more
members of a population, as population density increases.
Predation may be a density-dependent factor limiting a prey population if a predator
increases its rate of predation when prey density is higher.
4. Small populations are more likely to become extinct than larger ones because inbreeding reduces the
number, health, and genetic variability of offspring, or a local natural disaster could eliminate the
entire population.
5. After remaining steady for most of human history, the human population has been increasing
exponentially since the 1600s due to increasing life expectancy and greater ability to exploit
resources. However, the growth rate has slowed since the 1960s due to a reduction in birth rate in
developed, as well as many developing, countries.
