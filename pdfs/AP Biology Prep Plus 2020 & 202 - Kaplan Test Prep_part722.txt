that more birds on the island will have
large beaks. (B) is thus correct. (A) is incorrect because beak size does
not experience selection in any particular direction since the question
stem stated that food was available for many beak types. (C) is
incorrect because the founding population had a diﬀerent distribution
of traits than the mainland population. (D) is incorrect because there is
no selective advantage for large beak size as a result of the availability
of food for any beak type; more large-beaked birds are expected due to
a founder eﬀect.

According to the biological species concept, two populations are
distinct species if they are unable to interbreed to produce fertile
oﬀspring. Because the resistant buﬀalo grass cannot interbreed with
the nonresistant, the resistant grass has undergone speciation.
Therefore, (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect because speciation does not
require geographic isolation; distinct species can occupy the same
