Heating the air inside a “hot-air” balloon raises the air’s temperature, causing 
it to expand, and forces some of the air out the opening at the bottom. The
reduced amount of air inside means its density is lower than the outside air, so
there is a net buoyant force upward on the balloon (Chapter 10). In this Chapter
we study temperature and its effects on matter: thermal expansion and the 
gas laws. We examine the microscopic theory of matter as atoms or molecules
that are continuously in motion, which we call kinetic theory. The temperature 
of a gas is directly related to the average translational kinetic energy of its
molecules. We will consider ideal gases, but will also look at real gases and 
how they change phase, includ
