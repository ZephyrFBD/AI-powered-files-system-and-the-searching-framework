omes hot as well,
even though it is not directly in contact with the source of heat. We say that heat
has been conducted from the hot end to the cold end.
Heat conduction in many materials can be visualized as being carried out via
molecular collisions. As one end of an object is heated, the molecules there move
faster and faster (
higher temperature). As these faster molecules collide with
slower-moving neighbors, they transfer some of their kinetic energy to them,
which in turn transfer some energy by collision with molecules still farther along
the object. Thus the kinetic energy of thermal motion is transferred by molecular
collision along the object. In metals, collisions of free electrons are mainly responsi-
ble for conduction. Conduction between objects in physical contact occurs similarly.
Heat conduction from one point to another takes place only if there is a dif-
ference in temperature between the two points. Indeed, it is found experimentally
that the rate of heat flow thr
