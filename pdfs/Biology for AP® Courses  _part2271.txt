ion from parent(s) to offspring. These transfers allow even distantly related species to share
genes, influencing their phenotypes. It is thought that HGT is more prevalent in prokaryotes, but that only about 2% of the
prokaryotic genome may be transferred by this process. Some researchers believe such estimates are premature: the actual
importance of HGT to evolutionary processes must be viewed as a work in progress. As the phenomenon is investigated
more thoroughly, it may be revealed to be more common. Many scientists believe that HGT and mutation appear to be
(especially in prokaryotes) a significant source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for the process of natural
selection. These transfers may occur between any two species that share an intimate relationship (Table 20.1).
