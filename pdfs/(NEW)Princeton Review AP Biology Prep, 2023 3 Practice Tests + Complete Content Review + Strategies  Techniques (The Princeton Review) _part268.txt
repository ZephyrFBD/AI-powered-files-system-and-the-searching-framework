THE CELL CYCLE
Every second, thousands of cells are dying throughout our bodies. Fortunately, the body replaces them at an
amazing rate. In fact, epidermal cells, or skin cells, die off and are replaced so quickly that the average 18-year-old
grows an entirely new skin every few weeks. The body keeps up this unbelievable rate thanks to the mechanisms of
cell division.
The remainder of this chapter takes a closer look at how cells divide. But remember, cell division is only a small part
of the life cycle of a cell. Most of the time, cells are busy carrying out their regular activities. There are also some
types of cells that are nondividing. Often, these are highly specialized cells that are created from a population of less
specialized cells. The body continually makes them as needed, but they do not directly replicate themselves. Red
blood cells are an example of nondividing cells. Some other cells are just temporarily nondividing. They enter a
phase called G0,
