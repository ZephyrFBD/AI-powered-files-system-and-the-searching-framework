sister lineages caused by a parvovirus. The virus exploits
the host’s transferrin, a membrane-bound protein used for
iron transport, to attach to the cell. The phylogeny of the
Parvoviridae family has been constructed (J. Kaebler,
PLOS Pathogens, 2012). That study revealed the evolution
of both the virus and the host protein through selection to
resist infection. About 54 million years ago when the
lineage of cats (Feliformia) diverged from that of dogs
(Caniformia), the parvovirus envelope diverged as well,
conforming to changes in the host’s transferrin. In 1978, a
worldwide disease in dogs due to a parvovirus suddenly
appeared.
