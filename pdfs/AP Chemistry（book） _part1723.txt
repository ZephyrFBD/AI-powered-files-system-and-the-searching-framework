Sample Exercise 11.1 
Identifying Substances That Can Form Hydrogen Bonds
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the chemical formulas of four compounds 
and asked to predict whether they can participate in hydrogen 
bonding. All the compounds contain H, but hydrogen bonding 
usually occurs only when the hydrogen is covalently bonded to  
N, O, or F.
Plan We analyze each formula to see if it contains N, O, or F di-
rectly bonded to H. There also needs to be a nonbonding pair 
of electrons on an electronegative atom (usually N, O, or F) in a 
nearby molecule, which can be revealed by drawing the Lewis 
structure for the molecule.
Solve The foregoing criteria eliminate CH4 and H2S, which do not 
contain H bonded to N, O, or F. They also eliminate CH3F, whose 
Lewis structure shows a central C atom surrounded by three H 
atoms and an F atom. (Carbon always forms four bonds, whereas 
hydrogen and fluorine form one each.) Because the molecule 
con
