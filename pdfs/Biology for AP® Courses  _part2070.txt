s change such that dark form of the
moth is favored and the light form is diminished
in the population due to predation. Conditions
change again, and both forms have equal
prevalence.
d.
Conditions change such that dark form of the
moth is favored and the light form is eradicated
in the population due to predation. Conditions
change again, the dark form is vulnerable. It
develops an adaptation that shields it from
predation.
45. Given your understanding of evolutionary theory and
the relationship between evolution and the genetic makeup
of populations, which statement is false?
a.
Homologous characteristics that have evolved
more recently are shared only within smaller
groups of organisms.
b.
The genetic code is a homologous characteristic
shared by all species because they share a
common ancestor in the deep past.
c.
DNA sequence data would likely support any
evolutionary tree drawn from anatomical data
sets.
d.
The degree of relatedness between groups of
organisms is only sometimes r
