▶Practice Exercise 2
Decomposition of KClO3 is sometimes used to prepare small  
amounts of O2 in the laboratory: 2 KClO31s2 ¡ 2 KCl1s2 +
3 O21g2. How many grams of O2 can be prepared from 4.50 g of 
KClO3?

CHAPTER 3 Chemical Reactions and Reaction Stoichiometry
3.7 ∣ Limiting Reactants
Suppose you wish to make several sandwiches using one slice of cheese and two slices of 
bread for each. Using Bd = bread, Ch = cheese, and Bd2Ch = sandwich, we can repre-
sent the recipe for making a sandwich like a chemical equation:
2 Bd + Ch ¡ Bd2Ch
If you have ten slices of bread and seven slices of cheese, you can make only five sand-
wiches and will have two slices of cheese left over. The amount of bread available limits 
the number of sandwiches.
An analogous situation occurs in chemical reactions when one reactant is used up 
before the others. The reaction stops as soon as any reactant is totally consumed, leaving 
the
