Figure 26.10 The (a) resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na+ and K+ ions inside
and outside the cell. A nerve impulse causes Na+ to enter the cell, resulting in (b) depolarization. At the peak action
potential, K+ channels open and the cell becomes (c) hyperpolarized.
Action Potential
A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.
Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a
signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential
called an action potential. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, ion channels
