In recent years fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, has become 
widely used to greatly increase the availability of petroleum reserves. 
In fracking, a large volume of water, typically two million gallons or 
more, mixed with various additives, is injected at high pressure into 
wellbores extended horizontally into rock formations (Figure 18.23). 
The water is laden with sand, ceramic materials, and other additives, 
including gels, foams, and compressed gases, that serve to increase 
the yield in the process. The high-pressure ﬂuid ﬁnds its way into tiny 
faults in geological formations, releasing petroleum and natural gas. 
Fracking has greatly increased petroleum reserves, particularly of nat-
ural gas, in many parts of the world.
Unfortunately, the potential for environmental d
