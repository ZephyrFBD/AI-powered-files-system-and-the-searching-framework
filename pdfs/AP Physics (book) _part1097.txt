Heart as a pump
Blood pressure is measured using one of the types of gauge mentioned earlier
(Section 10–6), and it is usually calibrated in mm-Hg. The gauge is attached to 
a closed, air-filled cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm at the level of the
heart, Fig. 10–42. Two values of blood pressure are measured: the maximum pres-
sure when the heart is pumping, called systolic pressure; and the pressure when the
heart is in the resting part of the cycle, called diastolic pressure. Initially, the air
pressure in the cuff is increased high above the systolic pressure by a pump,
compressing the main (brachial) artery in the arm and briefly cutting off the flow
of blood. The air pressure is then reduced slowly until blood again begins to flow
into the arm; it can be detected by listening with a stethoscope to the characteristic
tapping sound† of the blood returning to the forearm. At this point, systolic pressure
is just equal to the air pr
