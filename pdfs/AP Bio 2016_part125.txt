Refinement: sulcatone (1 point) 
Use cotton ball/guinea pig/guinea-pig model soaked in sulcatone vs. control without 
sulcatone  
Use gloved/covered human hand that prevents odorant molecules from being 
released

OR4 gene in mosquitoes 
(c) Predict how each of the following mutations in the OR4 gene would most likely affect the 
sensitivity of mosquitoes to sulcatone. Justify each prediction. (4 points) 
A mutation that results in the removal of the intracellular domain of the receptor protein 
A mutation that results in the substitution of a small hydrophobic amino acid for 
another small hydrophobic amino acid in the ligand-binding site of the receptor protein
