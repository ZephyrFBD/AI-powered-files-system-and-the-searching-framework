Foundation Species
Foundation species are considered the “base” or “bedrock” of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall
structure. They are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community. Kelp, brown
algae, is a foundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of California.
Foundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other
organisms that use them. An example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef (Figure 36.29). Corals themselves
are not photosynthetic, but harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform
photosynthesis; this is another example of a mutualism. The exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef
structure, which protects many other species from waves and ocean currents.
