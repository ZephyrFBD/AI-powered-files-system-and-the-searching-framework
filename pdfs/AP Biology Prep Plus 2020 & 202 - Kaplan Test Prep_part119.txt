iduals with more
favorable phenotypes are more likely to survive and produce more
oﬀspring, thus passing traits to subsequent generations. If people in a
specific population have an increased frequency of sickled
hemoglobin genes, as compared to the rest of the world, it is therefore
likely that the faulty gene confers some advantage onto them that
makes them more likely to survive. Thus, (B) is correct. (A) can be
eliminated because, from the information provided, it is clear that
there is a correlation between frequency of sickled hemoglobin gene
and risk for malaria, though the causation is unknown. If individuals
who are carriers of the sickled hemoglobin gene provided a better
target for malaria-carrying mosquitoes, under Darwin’s theory, a lower
frequency of the sickled hemoglobin gene in this population would
then be expected, eliminating (C). Similarly, unless the sickled
hemoglobin gene confers some evolutionary advantage, even if it were
caused by mutations resulting from a m
