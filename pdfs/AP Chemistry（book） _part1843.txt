 cell. In two dimensions the unit cells must tile, or fit together in space, 
in such a way that they completely cover the area of the lattice with no gaps. In three 
dimensions, the unit cells must stack together to fill all space.
In a two-dimensional lattice, the unit cells can take only one of the five shapes 
shown in Figure 12.4. The most general type of lattice is the oblique lattice. In this lattice, 
the lattice vectors are of different lengths and the angle g between them is of arbitrary 
size, which makes the unit cell an arbitrarily shaped parallelogram. The square lattice, 
rectangular lattice, hexagonal lattice,** and rhombic lattice have a unique combination 
of g angle and relationship between the lengths of lattice vectors a and b (shown in 
Figure 12.4). For a rhombic lattice an alternative unit cell can be drawn, a rectangle with 
lattice points on its corners and its center (shown in green in Figure 12.4). Because of this,
