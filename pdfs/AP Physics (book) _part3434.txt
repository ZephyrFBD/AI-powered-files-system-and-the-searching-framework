ctive isotopes used in the laboratory are made by means of nuclear
reactions. Nuclear reactions can be made to occur in the laboratory, but they also
occur regularly in nature. In Chapter 30 we saw an example:

being made in the atmosphere via the reaction
Nuclear reactions are sometimes written in a shortened form: for example,
can be written
The symbols outside the parentheses on the left and right represent the initial
and final nuclei, respectively. The symbols inside the parentheses represent the
bombarding particle (first) and the emitted small particle (second).
In any nuclear reaction, both electric charge and nucleon number are con-
served. These conservation laws are often useful, as the following Example shows.
Deuterium reaction. A neutron is
observed to strike an 
nucleus, and a deuteron is given off. (A deuteron, or
deuterium, is the isotope of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron,
it is sometimes given the symbol d or D.) What is the nucleus that
