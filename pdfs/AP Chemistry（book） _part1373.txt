e space between the atoms. 
 (Section 8.3) A bonding pair of electrons thus 
defines a region in which the electrons are most likely to be found. We will refer to such 
a region as an electron domain. Likewise, a nonbonding pair (or lone pair) of electrons,

The VSEPR Model

which was also discussed in Section 8.3, defines an electron domain that is located prin-
cipally on one atom. For example, the Lewis structure of NH3 has four electron domains 
around the central nitrogen atom (three bonding pairs, represented as usual by short 
lines, and one nonbonding pair, represented by dots):
