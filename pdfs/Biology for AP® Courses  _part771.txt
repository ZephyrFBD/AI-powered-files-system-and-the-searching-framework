producers of an aquatic ecosystem in summer.
Describe the source of energy transfer to the
system of photosynthetic plants and algae.
Predict changes in the system in response.
Explain what happens to the entropy of this
trophic level when energy transfer occurs. Now
consider the primary producers and their
aqueous environment as the system. Explain
what happens to the entropy of this system
composed of photosynthetic organisms and their
abiotic environment.
6.
Predict the change in entropy of the system
when both autotrophs and their abiotic
environment are considered. Justify your
prediction. Predict the signs of the entropy
changes in both biotic and abiotic components of
this system. Predict the relative magnitudes of
these entropy changes, and justify your
prediction.
63. The sodium-potassium pump is an example of free-
energy coupling. The free energy derived from exergonic
ATP hydrolysis is used to pump sodium and potassium
ions across the cell membrane. The hydrolysis of
