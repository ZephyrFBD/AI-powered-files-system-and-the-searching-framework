or the closely related compound guanine (guano),
reflecting the close evolutionary ancestry of these groups.
However, terrestrial arthropods also convert ammonia to
uric acid. This is as opposed to fish, which excrete
ammonia directly, without converting it to another
substance. However, the conversion of ammonia to uric
acid requires more energy and is much more complex than
the conversion of ammonia to urea. What do these findings
suggest about why these organisms evolved the conversion
of ammonia to uric acid?
a.
To evolve the ability to switch between uric acid
and ammonia excretion
b.
To conserve water to allow them to persist on
land
c.
For reduction in excretion of ammonia
d.
For excretion of higher concentrations of
ammonia
63. The kidneys are controlled by hormones from the
brain, liver, and other locations. However, the kidneys also
produce the hormone renin in their juxtaglomerular
complex. How would damage to the juxtaglomerula
