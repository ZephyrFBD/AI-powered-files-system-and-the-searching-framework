Question 16 is based on the material below.
Nitrate salts are added to food as a preservative. Nitrite salts and amino groups react to form nitrosamines.
Nitrosamines are potent mutagens. Since nitrates contain amino groups, there are concerns about using
nitrates to preserve meats.
An experiment was performed to test the effect of adding vitamin C (ascorbate) on the mutagenesis of
nitrates on bacteria living on meats. Bacterial cells were incubated with cured meat extracts in either the
presence or absence of ascorbate. The rate of mutation for the bacteria cells was determined. The data are
below.
