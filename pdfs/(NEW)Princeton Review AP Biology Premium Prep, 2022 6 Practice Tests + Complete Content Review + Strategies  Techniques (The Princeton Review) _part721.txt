e the cell.
d. Predict what would happen if the level of sodium inside the cell was not relatively low at the onset of the
experiment. (2 points)
If the sodium was not low, then there would not be a pull for the sodium to enter the cell. Sodium is entering due to
its concentration gradient. If the sodium was high in the cell, then the sodium would probably remain in the media.
Question 2
a. Basking sharks filter feed on plankton, tiny ocean organisms. Describe (1 point) an adaptation and explain (1
point) how that adaptation could increase a sharkâ€™s fitness.
A behavioral adaptation that basking sharks have is slow movement with their mouth open. By moving this way it
would allow the shark to gather as much food as possible while using as little energy as possible. This would enable the
shark to maximize growth, longevity, and mating opportunities which would increase its fitness.
(Any shark adaptation like fins, mouth, or tail that is linked to fitness would earn two points.)
b. Constr
