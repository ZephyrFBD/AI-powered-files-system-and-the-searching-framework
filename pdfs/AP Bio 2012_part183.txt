or.  
Based on the considerations, the student is able to explain 
how populations and communities with species diversity  
(e.g., a prairie) are better able to withstand change to  
the environment.
Characteristics of a 
WEAK Response 
(Part a) The student’s narrative is less coherent and often 
lacks correct terminology. The student is able to state that 
organisms require free energy to survive but is limited in 
ability to explain why free energy is necessary. The student 
identifies photosynthesis as an energy-producing process in 
plants and can list ATP (and possibly NADPH) as an energy-
carrying molecule(s) produced in photosynthesis. However, 
the student’s explanation of how the electron transport chain 
produces energy in the form of ATP (and/or NADPH) is 
limited and reflects little conceptual understanding on the 
molecular level. The student is able to predict one to two 
consequences of a virus that acts by disrupting the ETS  
but cannot elaborate on the reasons (justif
