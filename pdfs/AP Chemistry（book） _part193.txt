antity by a conversion factor, the units multiply and divide as follows:
Given unit * desired unit
given unit
= desired unit
If the desired units are not obtained in a calculation, an error must have been made 
somewhere. Careful inspection of units often reveals the source of the error.
denominator are the same quantity expressed in different units. For example, 2.54 cm 
and 1 in. are the same length: 2.54 cm = 1 in. This relationship allows us to write two 
conversion factors:
2.54 cm
1 in.  and 
1 in.
2.54 cm
We use the first factor to convert inches to centimeters. For example, the length in 
centimeters of an object that is 8.50 in. long is

At a particular instant in time, the Earth is judged to be 
92,955,000 miles from the Sun. What is the distance in  
kilometers to four significant figures? (See the back inside 
cover for the conversion factor). 
(a) 5763 * 104 km (b) 1.496 * 108 km (c) 1.49596 * 108 km  
(d) 1.483 * 10
