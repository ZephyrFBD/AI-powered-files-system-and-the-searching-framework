ther from the speaker. If both speakers
then play the same tone together, what do you hear as you
wander around the room?
(a) The pitch of the sound increases to 800 Hz, and the
sound is louder but not twice as loud. It is louder closer
to the speakers and gradually decreases as you move
away from the speakers—except near the back wall,
where a slight echo makes the sound louder.
(b) The sound is louder but maintains the same relative
spatial pattern of gradually decreasing volume as you
move away from the speakers.
(c) As you move around the room, some areas seem to be
dead spots with very little sound, whereas other spots
seem to be louder than with only one speaker.
(d) The sound is twice as loud—so loud that you cannot
hear any difference as you move around the room.
(e) At points equidistant from both speakers, the sound is
twice as loud. In the rest of the room, the sound is the
same as if a single speaker were playing.
