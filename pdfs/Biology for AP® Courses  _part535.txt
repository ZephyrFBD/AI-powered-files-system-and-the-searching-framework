to some of the lipids and some of the proteins. A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids,
and a phosphate-linked head group. Cholesterol, another lipid composed of four fused carbon rings, is found alongside the
phospholipids in the core of the membrane. The proportions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in the plasma membrane
vary with cell type, but for a typical human cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids
(of all types) account for about 40 percent of the composition by mass, with the remaining 10 percent of the composition
by mass being carbohydrates. However, the concentration of proteins and lipids varies with different cell membranes. For
example, myelin, an outgrowth of the membrane of specialized cells that insulates the axons of the peripheral nerves,
contains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and
only 24 percent lipid. The plasma m
