s as sources of free
energy.
The following chart shows modes of nutrition:
Mode of Nutrition
Description; Examples (Other Nonprokaryote Examples)
Photoautotrophy
Use light as an energy source and gain carbon from CO2; cyanobacteria
(also plants and some protists)
Chemoautotrophy
Use an inorganic energy source and gain carbon from CO2; some
archaebacteria
Photoheterotrophy
Use light as an energy source and gain carbon from organic sources; some
prokaryotes
Chemoheterotrophy
Use an organic energy source and gain carbon from organic sources; most
prokaryotes (also animals, fungi, and some protists)
2. Biological systems can capture energy at multiple points in their energy-related pathways. Some
examples of these pathways include the Krebs Cycle, glycolysis, the Calvin Cycle, and fermentation.
3. Energy capturing processes, such as NADP+ in photosynthesis and oxygen in cellular respiration, use
different types of electron acceptors.
