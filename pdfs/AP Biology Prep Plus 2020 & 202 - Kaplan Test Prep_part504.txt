nd photosynthesis utilize chemiosmosis, whereas glycolysis and other
forms of ATP creation do not.
The mitochondrion moves H+ into the intermembrane space via the
electron transport chain, which creates a proton gradient across the
inner membrane. The energy to do this comes from the breakdown of
food. The chloroplast moves H+ into the thylakoid space in a way very
similar to the mitochondrion, but it drives the oxidative phosphorylation
process with light energy. This process is called photophosphorylation.

AP EXPERT NOTE
Chemiosmosis in a Mitochondrion
The processes that drive electron transport and chemiosmosis are
similar in both photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
The structures that perform chemiosmosis are examples of form
specialized for function. The invaginations of the inner membrane
(cristae) inside the mitochondrion provide an increased surface area.
Even the proteins in the membrane are aligned in a way that spans th
