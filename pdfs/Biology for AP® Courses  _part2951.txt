 Fats are required in the diet to aid the
absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.
Essential Nutrients
While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are
some nutrients that need to be consumed from food. These nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be
eaten, and the body cannot produce them.
The omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane
phospholipids. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many
enzymes to function and, for this reason, are considered to be co-enzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have
a dramatic effect on health, as outlined in Table 25.1 and Table 25.2. Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must
be obtained from food. Minerals, listed in Table 25.3, are inorganic essential nutrients that must be
