TRANSFORMATION*
How can we use genetic engineering techniques to 
manipulate heritable information?
 
â– BACKGROUND
Are genetically modified foods safe? There is ongoing debate about whether it is safe 
to eat fruit and vegetables that are genetically modified to contain toxins that ward off 
pests. For instance, biotechnologists have succeeded in inserting a gene (Bt) from the 
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into the corn genome. When expressed, the Bt toxin 
kills caterpillars and controls earworms that damage corn, but is the corn safe for 
human consumption?
Genetic information passed from parent to offspring via DNA provides for 
continuity of life. In order for information in DNA to direct cellular activities, it
