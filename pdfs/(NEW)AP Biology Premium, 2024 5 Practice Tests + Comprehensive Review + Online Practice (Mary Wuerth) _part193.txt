ylakoids. The Calvin cycle, as shown in Figure 8.5, is a complicated, multistep
process that can be broken down into three main parts:
1. Fixation of carbon: Fixation means turning a biologically unusable form into a usable form. In the fixation
of carbon, the enzyme ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase (Rubisco, for short) adds one molecule of carbon
dioxide to the five-carbon molecule ribulose-bisphosphate (RuBP, for short). This produces a six-carbon
intermediate that is unstable, which then breaks down further into two three-carbon molecules.
2. Reduction: Now the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions are used to reduce the three-
carbon molecules. The energy to do this comes from the ATP, and the NADPH provides the hydrogen atoms
(reducing power). A three-carbon molecule called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (simply known as G3P) is
produced at the end of this process. G3P can be used to make sugars, but some of the G3P is used in the final
part of the Calvin cycle: regenerati
