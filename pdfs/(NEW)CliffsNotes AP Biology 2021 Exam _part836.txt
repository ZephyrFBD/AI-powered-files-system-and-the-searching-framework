rd rate of the reaction. Increasing the
enzyme concentration will not slow the reaction rate but may increase it if the substrate concentration is high enough
to utilize additional enzymes. An increase in pH may change the rate of reaction, but the nature of the enzyme must
be known in order to determine whether the rate is increased or decreased.
7. A. The ascus containing ascospores with two groups of four adjacent ascospores of the same color results when
no crossovers occur. If no crossing over takes place, the order of ascospores corresponds to each of the four
chromatids of a homologous pair of chromosomes (two ascospores from each chromatid). Thus, the first four
ascospores possess traits from one parent and the second four ascospores possess traits from the second parent. If
crossing over occurs, traits on two nonsister chromatids will exchange, resulting in a swap of traits between one pair
of ascospores and another pair and producing an ascus that may look like any one of the
