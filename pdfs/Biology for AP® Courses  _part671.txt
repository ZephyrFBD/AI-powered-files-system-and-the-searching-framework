rd conditions, and so standard calculated ∆G values for biological reactions will be different

Endergonic Reactions and Exergonic Reactions
If energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number.
In other words, reactions that release energy have a ∆G < 0. A negative ∆G also means that the products of the reaction
have less free energy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a
negative ∆G and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions. Think: exergonic means energy is exiting
the system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without the addition of
energy into the system. Understanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful
for biologists, because these reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. An important dis
