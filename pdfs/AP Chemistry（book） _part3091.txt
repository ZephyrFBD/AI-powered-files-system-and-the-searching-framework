eral 
chalcocite, which contains Cu2S. The decomposition of Cu2S to its ele-
ments is nonspontaneous:
Cu2S1s2 ¡ 2 Cu1s2 + S1s2  ∆G° = +86.2 kJ
Because ∆G° is very positive, we cannot obtain Cu(s) directly via 
this reaction. Instead, we must ﬁnd some way to “do work” on the 
reaction to force it to occur as we wish. We can do this by coupling 
the reaction to another one so that the overall reaction is sponta-
neous. For example, we can envision the S(s) reacting with O21g2 to 
form SO21g2:
S1s2 + O21g2 ¡ SO21g2  ∆G° = -300.4 kJ
By coupling (adding together) these reactions, we can extract much 
of the copper metal via a spontaneous reaction:
Cu2S1s2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 Cu1s2 + SO21g2
∆G° = 1+86.2 kJ2 + 1-300.4 kJ2 = -214.2 kJ
In essence, we have used the spontaneous reaction of S(s) with O21g2 
to provide the free energy needed to extract the copper metal from 
the mineral.
Biological systems employ the same principle of using sponta-
neous reactions to drive nonspontaneous ones. Many of the
