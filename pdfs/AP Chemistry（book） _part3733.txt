d electrons and is paramagnetic, while 3Co(CN)643 - has no 
unpaired electrons and is diamagnetic. The absorption spectrum also shows peaks corre-
sponding to the different values of âˆ† in these two complexes.
Give It Some Thought
In octahedral complexes, for which d electron counts is it possible to have high-
spin and low-spin arrangements with different numbers of unpaired electrons?
In the transition metal ions of periods 5 and 6 (which have 4d and 5d valence elec-
trons), the d orbitals are larger than in the period 4 ions (which have only 3d electrons). 
Thus, ions from periods 5 and 6 interact more strongly with ligands, resulting in a larger 
crystal-field splitting. Consequently, metal ions in periods 5 and 6 are invariably low spin in 
an octahedral crystal-field.
The compound hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride is diamagnetic and orange in color with a single absorption peak in its visible 
absorption spectrum. (a) What is the electron configuration of the cobalt(III) ion? (b) Is
