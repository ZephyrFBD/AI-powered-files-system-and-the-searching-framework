tion 
with the given H2 mass, 150 g, but we can save a step by starting 
with the moles of H2, 74 mol, we just calculated:
 Grams H2O = 174 mol H22a 2 mol H2O
2 mol H2
b a
18.0 g H2O
1 mol H2O b 
 = 1.3 * 102  g  H2O 
Check The magnitude of the answer seems reasonable based on 
the amounts of the reactants. The units are correct, and the  
number of significant figures (two) corresponds to those in the 
values given in the problem statement.
Comment The quantity of the limiting reactant, H2, can also be 
used to determine the quantity of O2 used:
 Grams O2 = 174 mol H22a 1 mol O2
2 mol H2
b a
32.0 g O2
1 mol O2
b 
 = 1.2 * 103 g O2
The mass of O2 remaining at the end of the reaction equals the 
starting amount minus the amount consumed:
1500 g - 1200 g = 300 g.
