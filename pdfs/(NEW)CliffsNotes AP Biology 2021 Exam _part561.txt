e medulla, draining
into the center of the kidney, the renal pelvis. Details follow:
1. Bowman's capsule. The nephron tube begins with a bulb-shaped body at one end, the Bowman's capsule. A
branch of the renal artery (the afferent arteriole) enters into the Bowman's capsule, branches to form a dense ball of
capillaries called the glomerulus, and then exits the capsule (efferent arteriole).
2. Convoluted tubule. The convoluted tubule is a winding tube that begins with the proximal convoluted tubule
at the Bowman's capsule and ends with the distal convoluted tubule, where it joins with the collecting duct. The
middle of the tubule, called the loop of Henle, is shaped like a hairpin and consists of a descending and ascending
limb. Surrounding the tubule is a dense network of capillaries that originates from branches of the efferent arteriole
that exited the glomerulus. These capillaries merge into the renal vein as they exit the nephron. The blood flows
through the nephron, then, actually
