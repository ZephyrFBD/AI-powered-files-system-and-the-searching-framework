one mole of liquid ethanol, CH3CH2OH, 
produces 1367 kJ of heat. Calculate how much heat is pro-
duced when 235.0 g of ethanol are combusted.
 3.72  The combustion of one mole of liquid octane, CH3(CH2)6CH3, 
 
produces 5470 kJ of heat. Calculate how much heat is pro-
duced if 1.000 gallon of octane is combusted. See Exercise 3.68 
for necessary information about octane.

CHAPTER 3 Chemical Reactions and Reaction Stoichiometry
Limiting Reactants (Section 3.7)
 3.73 (a) Define the terms limiting reactant and excess reactant. 
(b) Why are the amounts of products formed in a reaction 
determined only by the amount of the limiting reactant?  
(c) Why should you base your choice of which compound is 
the limiting reactant on its number of initial moles, not on 
its initial mass in grams?
 3.74  Define the terms theoretical yield, actual yield, and percent 
yield. (b) Why is the actual yield in a reaction almost always 
less than the theoretical yield? (c) Can a reaction ever have 
110%
