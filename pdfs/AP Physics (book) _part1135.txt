has
the greater density?
5. A tub of water rests on a scale as shown in Fig. 10–63. The
weight of the tub plus water is 100 N. A 50-N concrete brick
is then lowered down from a fixed arm into the water but
does not touch the tub. What does the scale read now? [Hint:
Draw two free-body diagrams,one for the brick and a second
one for the tub + water + brick.]
6. What approximations are made in the derivation of
Bernoulli’s equation? Qualitatively, how do you think
Bernoulli’s equation would change if each of these 
approximations was not made? (See Sections 10–8, 10–9,
10–11, and 10–12.)
*7. Estimate the density of the water 5.4 km deep in the sea.
(See Table 9–1 and Section 9–5 regarding bulk modulus.)
By what fraction does it differ from the density at the 
surface?
1. A 5.0-kg block and 4.0 kg of water in a 0.50-kg container
are placed symmetrically on a board that can balance at
the center (Fig. 10–60). A solid aluminum cube of sides
10.0 cm is lowered into the water. How much of the
