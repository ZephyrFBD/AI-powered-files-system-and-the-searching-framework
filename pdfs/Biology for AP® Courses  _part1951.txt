lacZ gene will metabolize X-gal
c.
The foreign DNA and plasmid are cut with the
same restriction enzyme and DNA is inserted
randomly in the plasmid. The foreign DNA and
vector are allowed to anneal. The vector is
transferred to a bacterial host that is ampicillin
sensitive and the disrupted lacZ gene shows
inability to synthesize X-gal.
d.
The foreign DNA and plasmid are cut with the
same restriction enzyme and DNA is inserted
within the lacZ gene, whose product metabolizes
lactose. The foreign DNA and vector are
allowed to anneal. The vector is transformed into
a viral host that is ampicillin sensitive and the
disrupted lacZ gene show inability to synthesize
X-gal.
48. There are three methods of creating maps to evaluate
genomes: cytogenetic (staining chromosomes); radiation
hybrid maps (fragments with x-rays); and sequence maps
(comparing DNA sequences). Which of the following
accurately describes the three methods?
