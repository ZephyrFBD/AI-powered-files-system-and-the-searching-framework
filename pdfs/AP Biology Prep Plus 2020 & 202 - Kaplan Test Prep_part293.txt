Of the mechanisms discussed, only that of (B) would bend the plant
toward the blue light. (A), (C), and (D) would all cause the plant to
bend away from the blue light.

While most terrestrial plants live their lives as diploid sporophytes and
produce haploid tissues in the form of ovules and pollen, sometimes
within the same flower, aquatic plants typically reproduce through
spores, which travel independently from the plant that produced
them. Therefore, as the environment becomes more aquatic, a shiȇ
toward spore-producing plants would be expected, making (A) the
correct answer. Given that a new environment poses a variety of new
challenges, it is reasonable to expect that the process of pollination
(whether by animal or by wind) would be aﬀected too, making (B) a
highly unlikely answer. Since, according to the question stem, the
plant was already flowering, the line
