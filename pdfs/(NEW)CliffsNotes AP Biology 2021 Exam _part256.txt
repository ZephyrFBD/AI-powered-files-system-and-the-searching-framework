ent assortment of alleles (and their chromosomes).
The process is independent because the migration of homologues within one pair of homologous chromosomes to
opposite poles does not influence the migration of homologues of other homologous pairs.
Mendel mated, or crossed, two varieties of pea plants to form offspring, or hybrids. In these kinds of experiments,
the P generation represents the parents, the F1 generation represents the offspring from the crossing of the
parents, and the F2generation represents the offspring produced from
 
crosses among the F1. (The letter F stands for filial, which refers to sons
 
and daughters.) Two kinds of genetic experiments are common:
1. A monohybrid cross is an experiment in which only one trait is being investigated. For example, a cross between
a tall pea plant and a dwarf pea plant is a monohybrid cross because it is investigating a gene for only one trait, the
gene for stem length.
2. A dihybrid cross occurs when two traits are involved. A c
