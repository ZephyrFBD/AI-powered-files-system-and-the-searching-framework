song about an Irish boy that went to America and got 
 
 shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he 
 
 tells me don’t be gettin’ shot if you’re not near a priest. 
 
 Uncle Pa says that’s the saddest song he ever heard and is there any 
 
 chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, 
 
 Ah, no, Pa, sure I don’t have the wind. 
 
 Come on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one 
 
 voice only. 
 
 All right. I’ll try. 
 
 We all join in the chorus of her sad song, 
 
 A mother’s love is a blessing 
 
 No matter where you roam. 
 
 Keep her while you have her, 
 
 You’ll miss her when she’s gone. 
 
 Uncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we 
 
 turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone 
 
 would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to 
 
 drink with the sadness. 
 
 Oh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot.The moon is having an eclipse 
 
 abroad this minu
