CHAPTER 21
Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday’s Law
The transistors are imperfect switches and allow the charge on the tiny capac-
itors in each cell to be “leaky” and lose charge fairly quickly, so every cell has to
be read and rewritten (refreshed) many times per second. The D in DRAM stands
for this “dynamic” refreshing action. If the power is turned off, the capacitors
lose their charge and the data are lost. DRAM is thus referred to as being volatile
memory, whereas a hard drive keeps its (magnetic) memory even when the 
electric power is off and is called nonvolatile memory (doesn’t “evaporate”).
Flash memory is also made of semiconductor material on tiny “chips.” The
transistor structures are more compli
