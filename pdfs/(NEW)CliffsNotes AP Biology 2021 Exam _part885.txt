mbrane proteins. Additional investigations, however, are necessary to eliminate alternative hypotheses.
For example, parts of the chloroplast other than the proteins may be disabled and responsible for the decrease in
photosynthesis. Treatments I and III alone do not adequately test for this hypothesis because Treatment IV is also
necessary to establish that healthy chloroplasts are required for photosynthesis. Treatment II is unnecessary, as it
tests for the necessity of light, a variable not investigated in the hypothesis for this question (so the variable of light
should remain constant for this question).
44. D. The ordinate (vertical axis) of the graph represents p, the frequency of the dominant allele B. The frequency
of q, the recessive allele b, is calculated from p + q = 1, or q = 1 − p, which is equal to 1 − 0.4 = 0.6.
45. D. The frequency of phenotypes is calculated using the equation p2 +
 
2pq + q2 = 1. Black-colored beetles, the dominant trait, is expressed by both p2 and
