ncreasing age. Thus, green sea turtle survivorship is a Type 3 curve,
according to this graph. In a Type 1 survivorship curve, young
individuals have a relatively low death rate compared to old
individuals. The curve stays relatively level and then plummets with
old age. This is the opposite of what happens with green sea turtles, so
(A) is incorrect. In a Type 2 survivorship curve, individuals are equally
likely to die at any age. However, green sea turtles have a much greater
mortality rate when they are young than when they are old. Therefore,
(B) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because a Type 3 survivorship curve
accurately describes the situation for green sea turtles.

(C) Although giant sequoias are majestic trees, the amount of seeds
and seedling mortality clearly makes this a species with a Type 3
survivorship curve. (A) is incorrect because a Type 1 curve is the
opposite of what happens with giant sequoias. For Type 1 to be
correct, the seeds woul
