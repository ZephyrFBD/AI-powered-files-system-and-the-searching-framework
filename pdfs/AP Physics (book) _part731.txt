We are given

The m’s cancel out in both equations (the masses are equal). The second equation
yields [recall from trigonometry that
]:
So they do have equal speeds as we guessed at first. The x component equation
gives [recall that

If we know that a collision is elastic, we can also apply conservation of
kinetic energy and obtain a third equation in addition to Eqs. 7–8a and b:
or, for the collision shown in Fig. 7–18 or 7–19 (where
