 establishes 
the line along which the emission took place. If the difference in time of arrival 
of the two photons could be determined accurately, the actual position of the
emitting nuclide along that line could be calculated. Present-day electronics can
measure times to at best 
so at the 
ray’s speed 
the actual position could be determined to an accuracy on the order of about
which is not very useful. Although
there may be future potential for time-of-flight measurements to determine 
position, today computed tomography techniques are used instead, similar to
those for X-ray CT, which can reconstruct PET images with a resolution on the
order of 2–5 mm. One big advantage of PET is that no collimators are needed
(as for detection of a single photon—see Fig. 31–20a). Thus, fewer photons are
“wasted” and lower doses can be administered to the patient with PET.
Both PET and SPECT systems can give images that relate to biochemistry,
metabolism, and function. This is to be compared to X
