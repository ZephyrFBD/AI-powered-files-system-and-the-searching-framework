feed on sea urchins, which feed mainly on kelp. Where the sea otters are
abundant, there are few sea urchins and kelp forests are abundant. In
contrast, where orcas feed on sea otters, sea urchins are abundant and kelp
is rare.
BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN CONTROL OF A
COMMUNITY
There are two simplified models for the structure of a community based on
direction of influence. The bottom-up model focuses on influence from
lower to higher trophic levels. For example, an increase of minerals
available in the environment will increase the biomass of the producers,
and will increase the biomass up to and including the highest trophic level.
However, if you add or remove predators to and from the bottom-up
community, the effect will not extend down to the bottom levels.
In contrast, the top-down model (developed in 1963) states the
opposite. Removing the top carnivores from a community increases the
abundance of lower primary carnivores, which decreases the numbers of
herbivores, resulting in an
