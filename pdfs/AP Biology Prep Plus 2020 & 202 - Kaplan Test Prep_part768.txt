decrease biodiversity because they
outcompete native plants and are impenetrable.
(B)
The blackberries increase biodiversity because the brambles
provide food and shelter for many species.
(C)
The blackberries do not readily spread and cannot be
considered an invasive species.

4. In Belding’s ground squirrel populations, females rear most of the
young, while males mate with several females and wander from
territory to territory. They use alarm calls to alert other members
of their species to approaching land predators. A researcher
investigated the frequency of alarm calls in a population of
Belding’s ground squirrels and plotted the results as a function of
age and sex. The diagram compares the expected frequency of
calls (which assumes the calls were random) to the observed
frequency.
According to the data, which of the following best explains the
alarm calls of Belding’s ground squirrels?
