ight. The dependent variable is the percentage of recombinant
gametes produced.
(c) Cells that were exposed to UV light prior to undergoing meiosis produced more recombinant gametes. So
this supports the student’s claim that exposure to UV light prior to meiosis would increase the frequency of
genetic recombination.
(d) More exposure to UV light would probably produce even more recombinant gametes. Since the initial
exposure to UV light resulted in more recombinant gametes (than in those cells that were not exposed to UV
light), more exposure to UV light would further increase the number of recombinant gametes.

Overview
The study of genetics started with Mendelian genetics. This chapter reviews the laws of Mendelian genetics and the
laws of probability that relate to them.
