ing unable to detect low oxygen
levels in the blood. (C) is incorrect because the initial stimulus
(decreased oxygen in the blood) that disrupted homeostasis is not
relieved. (D) is incorrect because erythropoietin production is inhibited
by the detection of increased oxygen levels in the blood, which would
not be possible in the scenario described.
35. C
A subgroup of lipids is triglycerides, or fats. Since Sudan III stains
triglycerides, it tests for the presence of lipids. The correct answer is
(C). (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because Benedict’s tests for the
presence of monosaccharides (aldose and ketose), and Biuret tests for
the presence of proteins (chains of amino acids linked by peptide
bonds).
36. A
Glucose is an aldose (monosaccharide), so a solution containing
glucose will test positive (orange) for the Benedict’s solution. Albumin
is a protein (contains peptide bonds), so a solution containing albumin
will test positive (purple) for the Biuret reagent. Solution 3 is po
