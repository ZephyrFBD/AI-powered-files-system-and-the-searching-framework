Albumin does not permeate either type of membrane due to its size.
The dialysis tube selects only according to size, so NaCl is small
enough to cross it. A red blood cell membrane, in contrast, selects
according to both hydrophobicity and size; because NaCl is polar, it is
not permeable across the plasma membrane, though it can be
transported with carrier proteins. Hence, (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect
because carrier proteins can allow NaCl to exit a red blood cell. (B) is
incorrect because albumin is not permeable across a cell membrane (it
would require an alternative mechanism of transport). (C) is incorrect
because a red blood cell membrane is not permeable to NaCl.

The results in the table for chlorophenyl hydrazone suggest that the
protein requires energy in the form of ATP to transport sucrose. Thus,
the most justifiable conclusion is that the protein is involved in the
active transport of sucrose, (D). (A) and (C) are incorrect because t
