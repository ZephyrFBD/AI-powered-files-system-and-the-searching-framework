demon-
strate this in practice. Upon thinking about it, you will likely realize 
that the key idea for this experiment is separation: You can prove 
that milk is a mixture of chemical components if you can figure out 
how to separate these components.
Testing a hypothesis is a creative endeavor. While some exper-
iments may be more efficient than others, there is often more than 
one good way to test a hypothesis. Our question about milk, for 
example, might be explored by an experiment in which you boil a 
known quantity of milk until it is dry. Does a solid residue form in 
the bottom of the pan? If so, you could weigh it and calculate the per-
centage of solids in milk, which would offer good evidence that milk 
is a mixture. If there is no residue after boiling, then you still cannot 
distinguish between the two possibilities.
What other experiments might you do to demonstrate that milk 
is a mixture? You could put a sample of milk in a centrifuge, which 
you might have used in a b
