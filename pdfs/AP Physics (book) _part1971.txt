 A or at point B?
RESPONSE (a) Positive charge always flows from 
to 
from high potential
to low potential. So if current I is conventional (positive) current, point A is at 
a higher potential than point B.
(b) Conservation of charge requires that whatever charge flows into the resistor
at point A, an equal amount of charge emerges at point B. Charge or current
does not get “used up” by a resistor. So the current is the same at A and B.
An electric potential decrease, as from point A to point B in Example 18–4,
is often called a potential drop or a voltage drop.
Some Helpful Clarifications
Here we briefly summarize some possible misunderstandings and clarifications.
Batteries do not put out a constant current. Instead, batteries are intended to
maintain a constant potential difference, or very nearly so. (Details in the next
Chapter.) Thus a battery should be considered a source of voltage. The voltage is
applied across a wire or device.
Electric current passes through a wire or devic
