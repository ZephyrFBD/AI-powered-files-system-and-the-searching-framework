the Earth’s 
surface, compared to an “aerosol-free” atmosphere? Ex-
plain your reasoning.
 
[13.89]  Proteins can be precipitated out of aqueous solution by 
the addition of an electrolyte; this process is called “salting 
out” the protein. (a) Do you think that all proteins would 
be precipitated out to the same extent by the same concen-
tration of the same electrolyte? (b) If a protein has been 
salted out, are the protein–protein interactions stronger or 
weaker than they were before the electrolyte was added?

(c) A friend of yours who is taking a biochemistry class says 
that salting out works because the waters of hydration that 
surround the protein prefer to surround the electrolyte as 
the electrolyte is added; therefore, the protein’s hydration 
shell is stripped away, leading to protein precipitation. An-
other friend of yours in the same biochemistry class says 
that salting out works because the incoming ions adso
