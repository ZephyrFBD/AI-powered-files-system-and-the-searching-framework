f ammonia is spontaneous, they do not tell us anything about the rate at which ammo-
nia is formed. Establishing equilibrium in this system within a reasonable period requires 
a catalyst, as discussed in Section 15.7.

We have seen examples of endothermic processes that are spontaneous, such as the dis-
solution of ammonium nitrate in water. 
 (Section 13.1) We learned in our discussion 
of the solution process that a spontaneous process that is endothermic must be accom-
panied by an increase in the entropy of the system. However, we have also encountered 
processes that are spontaneous and yet proceed with a decrease in the entropy of the 
system, such as the highly exothermic formation of sodium chloride from its constitu-
ent elements. 
 (Section 8.2) Spontaneous processes that result in a decrease in the 
system’s entropy are always exothermic. Thus, the spontaneity of a reaction seems to 
involve two thermodynamic concepts, enthalpy and entropy.
