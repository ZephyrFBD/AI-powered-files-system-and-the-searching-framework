garithmic scale represents a 10-fold increase in the quantity being measured).
Small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Let’s examine why that is so. First,
we’ll consider the area and volume of a typical cell. Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a

sphere. You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is
4πr2, while the formula for its volume is 4πr3/3. Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the
square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a cell increases
in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube (see
this figure). If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not
