n no ampicillin is present. Indication of which bacteria 
took up the naked DNA with the ampr gene is undetermined. 
(C)
This option is correct. Plate IV shows that only E. coli with the plasmid 
containing the gene for ampicillin-resistant plasmid grew individual colonies 
with ampicillin in the agar, thus showing the competent cells that transformed 
successfully.
(D)
This option is incorrect. Plate II shows that there is no bacterial growth when 
ampicillin is present; thus, there are no ampicillin-resistant bacteria.
Question 41
Essential Knowledge
3.C.2: Biological systems have multiple processes that 
increase genetic variation.
Science Practice
6.2: The student can construct explanations of phenomena 
based on evidence produced through scientific practices.
Learning Objective 
3.28: The student is able to construct an explanation of 
the multiple processes that increase variation within a 
population.
(A)
This option is correct. The initial wild-type E. coli did not contain the
