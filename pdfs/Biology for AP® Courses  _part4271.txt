estions across four levels
of biological organizationâ€”organismal, population, community, and ecosystem. At the organismal level, ecologists study
individual organisms and how they interact with their environments. At the population and community levels, ecologists
explore, respectively, how a population of organisms changes over time and the ways in which that population interacts
with other species in the community. Ecologists studying an ecosystem examine the living species (the biotic components)
of the ecosystem as well as the nonliving portions (the abiotic components), such as air, water, and soil, of the
environment.
35.2 Biogeography
Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their
distribution. Endemic species are species that are naturally found only in a specific geographic area. The distribution of
living things is influenced by several environmental factors that are, in part, controlled by the latitude or e
