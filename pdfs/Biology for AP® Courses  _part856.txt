 to exploit
this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to evolve. When the full process of
oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally able to use
the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using
the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
