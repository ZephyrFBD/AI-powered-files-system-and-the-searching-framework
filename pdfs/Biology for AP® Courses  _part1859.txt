s, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts, can be probed for the presence of certain
sequences. Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid
detection. Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size. The fragments in the gel are then
transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting (Figure 17.5). The nucleic acid fragments that are bound
to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences.
When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called Southern blotting, and when RNA is transferred to
a nylon membrane, it is called northern blotting. Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences
in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression.
Figure 17.5 Southern blotting is used to find a particular sequence in a sample of DNA. DNA fragments are se
