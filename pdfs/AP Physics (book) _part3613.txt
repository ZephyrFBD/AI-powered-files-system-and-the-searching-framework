FIGURE 32–15 This computer-generated reconstruction of a
proton–antiproton collision at Fermilab occurred at an energy 
of nearly 2 TeV. It is one of the events that provided evidence
for the top quark (1995). The multiwire chamber (Section 30–13)
is in a magnetic field, and the radius of curvature of the charged
particle tracks is a measure of each particle’s momentum
(Chapter 20). The white dots represent signals seen on the
electric wires of the multiwire chamber. The colored lines are
particle paths. The top quark (t) has too brief a lifetime
to be detected itself, so we look for its possible decay
products. Analysis indicates the following interaction and
subsequent decays:
The tracks in the photo include jets (groups of particles moving
in roughly the same direction), and a muon 
whose track is
the pink one e
