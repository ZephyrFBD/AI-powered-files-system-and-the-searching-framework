Interactions within a community are complex but can be divided into
five categories: competition, predation, herbivory, symbiosis, and
facilitation.

The Russian scientist G. F. Gause developed the competitive exclusion
principle after studying the effects of interspecific competition in a
laboratory setting. He worked with two very similar species: Paramecium
caudatum and Paramecium aurelia. When he cultured them separately,
each population grew rapidly and then leveled off at the carrying capacity.
However, when he put the two cultures together, P. aurelia had the
advantage and drove the other species to extinction. His principle states
that two species cannot coexist in a community if they share a niche, that
is, if they use the same resources.
In nature, there a
