Most neurons must transmit a signal quickly. The
sarcolemmas (muscle cell membranes) of the cardiac
muscles receive signals that integrate information from
both the sympathetic (quick response with shorter time
scale) and parasympathetic (steady response with longer
time scale) divisions of the autonomic nervous system.
The action potential that induces periodic contractions of
the cardiac muscle (see figure below) is broadened at the
maximum by the release of Ca+2 from the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum, referred to as calcium-induced
calcium release (CICR).
