evolved in a circle of radius 1.3 m on a frictionless
horizontal surface. If the cord will break when the tension in
it exceeds 75 N, what is the maximum speed the ball can have?
6. (II) How fast (in rpm) must a centrifuge rotate if a particle
7.00 cm from the axis of rotation is to experience an accel-
eration of 125,000 gâ€™s?
7. (II) A car drives straight down toward the bottom of a valley
and up the other side on a road whose bottom has a radius of
curvature of 115 m.At the very bottom, the normal force on the
driver is twice his weight.At what speed was the car traveling?
8. (II) How large must the coefficient of static friction be
between the tires and the road if a car is to round a level
curve of radius 125 m at a speed of 
9. (II) What is the maximum speed with which a 1200-kg car
can round a turn of radius 90.0 m on a flat road if the 
coefficient of friction between tires and road is 0.65? Is
this result independent of the mass of the car?
95 kmh?
1890 kmh (525 ms)
