 throughout the Earthâ€™s history.
Speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which
the closely related species continue to interact.
Reconnection
After speciation, two species may continue interacting indefinitely or even recombine. Individual organisms will mate
with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with. An area where two closely related species continue to
interact and reproduce, forming hybrids, is called a hybrid zone. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the
fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers (Figure 18.24). If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, reinforcement
of speciation occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If
reproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one. Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and
reproductive: stability may occur and hybridiza
