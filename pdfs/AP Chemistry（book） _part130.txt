he law of constant composition (or the law of definite proportions). 
French chemist Joseph Louis Proust (1754–1826) first stated the law in about 1800. 
Although this law has been known for 200 years, the belief persists among some people 
that a fundamental difference exists between compounds prepared in the laboratory and 
the corresponding compounds found in nature. This simply is not true. Regardless of its 
source—nature or a laboratory—a pure compound has the same composition and proper-
ties under the same conditions. Both chemists and nature must use the same elements and 
operate under the same natural laws. When two materials differ in composition or proper-
ties, either they are composed of different compounds or they differ in purity.
Mixtures
Most of the matter we encounter consists of mixtures of different substances. Each substance 
in a mixture retains its chemical identity and properties. In contrast to a pure substance, 
which by definition has a fixed composition, t
