 more crossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are
on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as
a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of
genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.
Mendelâ€™s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered
linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment
postulate. The garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was
not a coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that
he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.
