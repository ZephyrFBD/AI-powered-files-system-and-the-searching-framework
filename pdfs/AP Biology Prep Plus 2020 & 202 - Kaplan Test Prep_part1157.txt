Chlorophyll is essential for a plantâ€™s ability to undergo photosynthesis. An
albino plant that cannot produce chlorophyll is unable to use light energy
to make sugars. Thus, once energy stored in the seed is exhausted, the
plant will die. (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect because in the symbiotic
relationship, the opposite occurs; plants supply sugars to the fungus while
the fungus supplies water and mineral nutrients, like phosphorus, from
the soil to the plant. (C) is incorrect because, albino plants with little to no
chlorophyll will have impaired photosynthesis. (D) is incorrect because
cellular respiration requires glucose to make ATP; without chlorophyll,
plants cannot make glucose.

The organic soup model suggests that life first arose when simple organic
molecules continued to increase in complexity until nucleic acids and
amino acids were formed. Nucleic acids eventually joined together to
create polynucleotides that eventually became self-replicating, organ
