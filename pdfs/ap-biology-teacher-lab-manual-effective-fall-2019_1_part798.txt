, results, and conclusions. They can also present their work in 
the form of a mini-poster. 
Homeostasis is also discussed when studying hormonal interactions (e.g., sugar balance 
with insulin and glucagon or water balance with diuretics and antidiuretics). Ask 
students to make a strong argument for the role of enzymes in maintaining homeostasis 
at the cellular level.
