Question 12.
10. (II) A bucket of mass 2.00 kg is whirled in a vertical circle of
radius 1.20 m. At the lowest point of its motion the tension
in the rope supporting the bucket is 25.0 N. (a) Find the
speed of the bucket. (b) How fast must the bucket move at
the top of the circle so that the rope does not go slack?
11. (II) How many revolutions per minute would a 25-m-
diameter Ferris wheel need to make for the passengers to
feel “weightless” at the topmost point?
12. (II) A jet pilot takes his aircraft in a vertical loop (Fig.5–38).
(a) If the jet is moving at a speed of 
at the 
lowest point of the loop, determine
the minimum radius of the 
circle so that the centripetal
acceleration at the lowest point
does not exceed 6.0 g’s. (b) Cal-
culate the 78-kg pilot’s effective
weight (the force with which the
seat pushes up on him) at the
bottom of the circle, and (c) at
the top of the circle (assume
the same spee
