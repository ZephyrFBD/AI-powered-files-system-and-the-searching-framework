P and inorganic phosphate. Under aerobic conditions, the stages of cellular respiration can generate 36-38 ATP.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. As shown in the table, concepts covered in this section also align
to the Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework that provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology
course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A Learning Objective
merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
