and such reactions are
associated with a release of energy. On the other end of the spectrum, anabolism refers to metabolic processes that build
complex molecules out of simpler ones, such as the synthesis of macromolecules. Anabolic processes require energy.
Glucose synthesis and glucose breakdown are examples of anabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively.

Although cells and organisms require free energy to survive, they cannot spontaneously create energy, as stated in the Law
of Conservation of Energy. Energy is
