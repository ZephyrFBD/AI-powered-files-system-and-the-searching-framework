 involved in the adaptive immune system
CHAPTER SUMMARY
33.1 Innate Immune Response
The innate immune system serves as a first responder to pathogenic threats that bypass natural physical and chemical
barriers of the body. Using a combination of cellular and molecular attacks, the innate immune system identifies the nature
of a pathogen and responds with inflammation, phagocytosis, cytokine release, destruction by NK cells, and/or a
complement system. When innate mechanisms are insufficient to clear an infection, the adaptive immune response is
informed and mobilized.
33.2 Adaptive Immune Response
The adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-lasting, and more specific response than the innate response.
However, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function. APCs display antigens
via MHC molecules to complementary na√Øve T cells. In response, the T cells differentiate and proliferate, becoming TH
cells or CTLs. TH cells stimulate B cells
