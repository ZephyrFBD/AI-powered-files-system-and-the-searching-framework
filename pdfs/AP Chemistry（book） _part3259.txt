ndard reduction potential for reduction of Fe2+1aq2 is less 
positive than that for reduction of O2, Fe1s2 can be oxidized by O21g2:
Cathode: 
O21g2 + 4 H+1aq2 + 4 e- ¡ 2 H2O1l2       E°
red = 1.23 V
Anode: 
 
 
    Fe1s2 ¡ Fe2+1aq2 + 2 e- 
E°
red = -0.44 V
A portion of the iron, often associated with a dent or region of strain, can serve as an 
anode at which Fe is oxidized to Fe2+ (Figure 20.25). The electrons produced in the oxi-
dation migrate through the metal from this anodic region to another portion of the sur-
face, which serves as the cathode where O2 is reduced. The reduction of O2 requires H+, 
so lowering the concentration of H+ (increasing the pH) makes O2 reduction less favor-
able. Iron in contact with a solution whose pH is greater than 9 does not corrode.
The Fe2+ formed at the anode is eventually oxidized to Fe3+, which forms the 
hydrated iron(III) oxide known as rust:*
