overall equation for cellular respiration is:
Cellular respiration includes the following cellular processes: glycolysis, the oxidation of pyruvate, the Krebs
cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation, all of which will be discussed in more
detail later in this chapter.
The presence or absence of oxygen determines which cellular processes a living organism can use to obtain
energy from food. Anaerobic organisms, which do not have access to or do not require oxygen, can perform
glycolysis and fermentation. Aerobic organisms that do not have access to oxygen can also perform glycolysis and
fermentation. In addition, in the presence of oxygen, aerobic organisms can also perform the oxidation of pyruvate,
the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Table 9.1 summarizes the differences between anaerobic organisms
and aerobic organisms in the presence or absence of oxygen.
