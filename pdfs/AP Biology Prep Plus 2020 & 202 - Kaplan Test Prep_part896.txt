abilizing and plateauing within the next year as limits from
density-dependent and density-independent factors are imposed
(A)
Growing at a rapid rate due to the lack of density-dependent
limiting factors and environmental constraints
(B)
Progressing toward extinction because the data shows their
reproduction rate is not reflective of their environmental constraints
(C)
Growing in excess of its carrying capacity, since there are no notable
fluctuations in population size
(D)
11. In addition to tracking the population growth rate, researchers also
mapped out the food pyramid (shown below) during the first year of
immigration into the new region:
If researchers later realize they need to amend the food pyramid to
include large birds of prey, which of the following would most likely be
true of the species in the habitat?
The rodent population is larger than the black-necked stilt
population.
(A)
The large birds of prey have the highest concentration of fat-soluble
toxins.
(B)
The total bi
