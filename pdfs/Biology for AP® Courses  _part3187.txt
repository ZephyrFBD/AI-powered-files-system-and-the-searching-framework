at is, if membrane potential reaches a threshold), the neuron will fire an action potential.
In most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction,
although for some receptors, such as those in the visual system, this is not always the case.

Figure 27.2 (a) Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the
plasma membrane. A mechanosensitive channel is connected to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by hair-
like tethers. When pressure causes the extracellular matrix to move, the channel opens, allowing ions to enter or exit
the cell. (b) Stereocilia in the human ear are connected to mechanosensitive ion channels. When a sound causes the
stereocilia to move, mechanosensitive ion channels transduce the signal to the cochlear nerve.
