Draw the orbital diagram for the electron configuration of oxygen, atomic number 8. How many unpaired electrons does an oxygen 
atom possess?
Sample Exercise 6.7 
Orbital Diagrams and Electron Configurations
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan Because oxygen has an atomic number of 
8, each oxygen atom has eight electrons. Figure 6.25 shows 
the ordering of orbitals. The electrons (represented as half 
arrows) are placed in the orbitals (represented as boxes) 
beginning with the lowest-energy orbital, the 1s. Each 
orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons (the Pauli 
exclusion principle). Because the 2p orbitals are degenerate, 
we place one electron in each of these orbitals (spin-up) 
before pairing any electrons (Hund’s rule).
Solve Two electrons each go into the 1s and 2s orbitals with 
their spins paired. This leaves four electrons for the three 
degenerate 2p orbitals. Following Hund’s rule, we put one 
electron into each 2p orbital until all three orbitals have one
