r the ligand binds, the intracellular 
domain of a receptor protein changes shape, 
initiating transduction of the signal.
b. 
Second messengers (such as cyclic AMP) 
are molecules that relay and amplify the 
intracellular signal.
c. 
Binding of ligand-to-ligand-gated channels 
can cause the channel to open or close.
