rage students to ask questions as they 
take a deeper dive into the concepts. You may assign these activities for homework or ask 
students to do them as they work through the investigation. Student lab groups can share 
questions they raise — and answers to questions they investigate — with other groups. 
You can follow up by asking more probing questions. 
■ Procedures 
To determine whose blood was on the classroom floor, students must first familiarize 
themselves with the techniques involved in creating genetic profiles using gel 
electrophoresis and calculating the sizes of restriction length polymorphisms (RFLPs). 
Students then analyze profiles resulting from an “ideal” or mock gel before running an 
actual gel. 
■ Designing and Conducting Independent Investigations 
Students use their newly learned technical skills to design and conduct a procedure 
based on DNA evidence to determine whose blood is spattered on the classroom floor in 
the crime scene scenario. Creating DNA prof
