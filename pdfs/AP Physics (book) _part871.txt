velocity. (a) Does a
point on the rim have radial and or tangential acceler-
ation? (b) If the disk’s angular velocity increases uniformly,
does the point have radial and or tangential acceleration?
(c) For which cases would the magnitude of either component
of linear acceleration change?
3. Can a small force ever exert a greater torque than a larger
force? Explain.
4. Why is it more difficult to do a sit-up with your hands
behind your head than when your arms are stretched out
in front of you? A diagram may help you to answer this.
5. If the net force on a system is zero, is the net torque also zero?
If the net torque on a system is zero, is the net force zero?
Explain and give examples.
6. Mammals that depend on being able to run fast have slender
lower legs with flesh and muscle concentrated high, close to
the body (Fig. 8–33). On the basis of rotational dynamics,
explain why this distribution of mass is advantageous.
