CHAPTER 22
Electromagnetic Waves
†For FM stereo broadcasting, two signals are carried by the carrier wave. One signal contains frequencies
up to about 15 kHz, which includes most audio frequencies. The other signal includes the same range
of frequencies, but 19 kHz is added to it. A stereo receiver subtracts this 19,000-Hz signal and distributes
the two signals to the left and right channels. The first signal consists of the sum of left and right channels
so monophonic radios (one speaker) detect all the sound. The second signal is the difference
between left and right 
Hence a stereo receiver must add and subtract the two signals to get
pure left and right signals for each channel.
