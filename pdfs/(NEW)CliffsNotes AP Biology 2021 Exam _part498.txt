to chemicals released by the
chewing insect, the plant releases volatile chemicals that attract parasitoid wasps. After the wasp lays fertilized eggs
on the host insects, the eggs hatch and the larvae feed inside the host. Eventually, the host dies, but the wasp larvae
pupate, undergo metamorphosis, and emerge as adult wasps.
Plant-plant interactions can occur when volatile substances, produced by one plant to attract predatory insects (as in
the above examples), also serve as a signal to other plants that herbivores are nearby. This gives neighboring plants
an opportunity to mount an early defense.
Certain acacia trees employ ants to protect them from herbivory. The acacias provide nectar, protein granules, and
hollow thorns in which to live. In return, the ants provide security, attacking any browser that touches the plant and
even trimming other plants that may shade the plant.
The chemical defenses afforded by secondary metabolites involve chemicals that are always present in the p
