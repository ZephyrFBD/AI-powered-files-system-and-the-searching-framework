y stop codons. In jawed vertebrates, retroviral
sequences or sequences that have been derived from them
are a significant fraction of the whole genome.
A. Explain why retroviral DNA rather than the genomes
of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or single-
stranded RNA viruses are found in host DNA.
Exaptation occurs when gene expression provides a
function that is independent of the selection pressures that
have acted on the gene. For example, a pigment that
provided selective advantage by reducing damage from
solar radiation becomes an element of mating behavior.
Feathers that evolved under selection to prevent heat loss
become a means of flight.
In a study of viral evolution within host genomes of
primates, Katzuorakis and Gifford (PLOS Genetics, 2010)
found that viral genomes within the host were surprisingly
stable; with computer simulation, they estimated the
probability of such constancy at 1 in 100,000.
B. Explain in terms of selection how viral genetic
information that no lo
