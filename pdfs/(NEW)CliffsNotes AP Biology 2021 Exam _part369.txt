scene are compared to RFLPs from the DNA of suspects. Areas of the human genome that are particularly
polymorphic contain short tandem repeats (STRs). STRs are short sequences of nucleotides (two to five base
pairs) that repeat multiple times, with the number of repeats varying markedly among individuals.
Concerns About Biotechnology
The advent of biotechnology has introduced new capabilities to human civilization. Improvements in the
identification and treatment of disease and advances in forensic science are clear benefits. But some benefits can
also be abused while the benefits of others are debated. In some cases, social and ethical questions arise. Here are
some of the issues that biotechnology presents:
1. Pharmaceuticals. DNA cloning allows quick and inexpensive
production of many pharmaceuticals. For example, human insulin (previously isolated from animals) and human
growth hormone (HGH) (previously obtained from human cadavers) are now readily available as products of DNA
