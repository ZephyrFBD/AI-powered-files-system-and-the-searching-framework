 does the surface area affect the rate 
of reaction?
 14.82 (a) If you were going to build a system to check the effec-
tiveness of automobile catalytic converters on cars, what 
substances would you want to look for in the car exhaust? 
(b) Automobile catalytic converters have to work at high 
temperatures, as hot exhaust gases stream through them. 
In what ways could this be an advantage? In what ways a 
disadvantage? (c) Why is the rate of flow of exhaust gases 
over a catalytic converter important?
 14.83 When D2 reacts with ethylene 1C2H42 in the presence of 
a finely divided catalyst, ethane with two deuteriums, 
CH2D¬CH2D, is formed. (Deuterium, D, is an isotope 
of hydrogen of mass 2.) Very little ethane forms in which 
two deuteriums are bound to one carbon (for example, 
CH3¬CHD2). Use the sequence of steps involved in the 
reaction (Figure 14.23) to explain why this is so.
 14.84 Heterogeneous catalysts that perform hydrogenation 
reactions, as illustrated in Figure 14.23, a
