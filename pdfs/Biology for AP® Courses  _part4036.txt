by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some
crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This
is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In
many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some
crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. In some species,
sex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent.
Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is
female first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, its termed protandry or “first male.” Oysters, for
example, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.
