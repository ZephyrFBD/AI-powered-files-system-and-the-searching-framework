 acids commonly found in proteins, each with a different R
group (variant group) that determines its chemical nature.
Which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on the surface of a soluble protein, and which would you
expect to find in the interior?
a.
Polar and charged amino acids will be found on the surface. Non-polar amino acids will be found in the
interior.
b.
Polar and charged amino acids will be found in the interior. Non-polar amino acids will be found on the
surface.
c.
Non-polar and uncharged proteins will be found on the surface as well as in the interior.
The chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar,
or nonpolar). For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino acids such as valine,
methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine
are polar and have hydrophilic side chains. The side
