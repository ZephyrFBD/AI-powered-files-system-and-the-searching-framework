the six continents, a veritable
army of 462,511 lamplightersfor the street lamps.
Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements
of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the
turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight,
these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for
their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that
would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and
Europe, then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North
America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage.
It would be magnificent.
Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his
colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole­­ only these two
would live free from toil
