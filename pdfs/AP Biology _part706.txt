l-or-none event; either the stimulus is strong
enough to cause an action potential or it is not. The body distinguishes
between a strong stimulus and a weak one by the frequency of action
potentials. A strong stimulus sets up more action potentials than a weak
one does.
 
REMEMBER
Transmission of information along neurons and synapses results in either a stimulatory or an
inhibitory response.
 
The graph in Figure 16.7 traces the events of a membrane experiencing
sufficient stimulation to undergo an action potential.

Figure 16.7 Axon Membrane Undergoing an Action Potential
The Synapse
Although an impulse travels along an axon electrically, it crosses a
synapse chemically. The cytoplasm at the terminal branch of the
presynaptic neuron contains many vesicles, each containing thousands of
molecules of neurotransmitter. Depolarization of the presynaptic
membrane causes Ca++ ions to rush into the terminal branch through
calcium gated channels. Th
