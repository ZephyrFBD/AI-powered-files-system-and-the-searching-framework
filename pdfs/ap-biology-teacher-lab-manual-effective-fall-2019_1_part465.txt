called retinoblastoma (Rb); Rb 
acts at the G1-S checkpoint to stop DNA synthesis. Rb binds to transcription factor 
E2F. E2F binds to the promoters of other transcription factors that allow the cell 
to proceed through mitosis. If the conditions are right, Rb is phosphorylated and 
dissociated from E2F.  
Other tumor suppressors included BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are associated with 
breast cancer.  These genes can increase cancer risk if they are mutated (recessive 
mutations). Other cancer-related genes are called proto-oncogenes. These are 
associated with growth factor receptors. For example, c-sis is the Î²-chain of platelet-
derived growth factor. When c-sis is mutated (dominant mutation), PDGF is 
overexpressed by cells. The simian sarcoma virus (SSV) carries the gene, so infection 
by SSV increases cancer risk. 
3. Ask students to consider how much genetic variation there would be without 
crossing over. 
4. Ask students what mechanisms of genetic change they have learned about
