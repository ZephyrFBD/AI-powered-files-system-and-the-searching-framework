aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na+ and water, raising
blood volume. The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca2+ and phosphate ions. Erythropoietin
(EPO) is a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO is released in response
to low oxygen levels. Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery
throughout the body. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells
allows for greater endurance. Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can
cause severe health risks.
