se tactile signals and have mechanoreceptors in their skin to detect prey. For instance, cave-dwelling fishes use
mechanoreceptors in their skin for communicating with other members and detecting prey.
Social Behavior
Many animals are highly social species, and they interact with each other in complex ways. Social behaviors can
help members of the species survive and reproduce more successfully. Several behavioral patterns for animal
societies are summarized below:
Agonistic behavior is aggressive behavior that occurs as a result of competition for food or other resources.
Animals will show aggression toward other members that tend to use the same resources. An example of

Dominance hierarchies (pecking orders) occur when members in a group have established which members are
