 organic
compounds into smaller molecules. The metabolic reactions of cells are
coupled so that energy released from catabolic reactions can be
harnessed to fuel anabolic reactions.
To survive, all organisms need energy. ATP is an energy intermediary
used to drive biosynthesis and other processes. ATP is generated in
mitochondria using the chemical energy of glucose and other nutrients.
The energy foundation of almost all ecosystems is photosynthesis.
Plants are autotrophs, or self-feeders, that generate their own chemical
energy from the energy of the Sun through photosynthesis. The chemical
energy that plants get from the Sun is used to produce glucose. This
glucose can then be burned in plant mitochondria to make ATP, which is
used to drive all of the energy-requiring processes in the plant, including
the production of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.
Similarly, animals can eat plants to extract the energy for their own
