om one object to
another because of a difference of temperature. Heat is thus
measured in energy units, such as joules.
Heat and internal energy are also sometimes specified in
calories or kilocalories (kcal), where
is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg
of water by 1 C°.
The specific heat, c, of a substance is defined as the energy
(or heat) required to change the temperature of unit mass of
the substance by 1 degree; as an equation,
(14;2)
where Q is the heat absorbed or given off,
is the temperature
increase or decrease, and m is the mass of the substance.
When heat flows between parts of an isolated system, con-
servation of energy tells us that the heat gained by one part of
the system is equal to the heat lost by the other part of the
system. This is the basis of calorimetry, which is the quantitative
measurement of heat exchange.
