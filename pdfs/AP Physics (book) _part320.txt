e, roughly what was the
minimum speed of the ball when it left the bat? Assume the
ball was hit 1.0 m above the ground and its path initially
made a 36° angle with the ground.
66. At serve, a tennis player aims to hit the ball horizontally.
What minimum speed is required for the ball to clear the
0.90-m-high net about 15.0 m from the server if the ball is
“launched” from a height of 2.50 m? Where will the ball
land if it just clears the net (and will it be “good” in the
sense that it lands within 7.0 m of the net)? How long will
it be in the air? See Fig. 3–54.
67. Spymaster Chris, flying a constant 
horizontally
in a low-flying helicopter, wants to drop secret documents
into her contact’s open car which is traveling 
on
a level highway 78.0 m below. At what angle (with the hori-
zontal) should the car be in her sights when the packet is
released (Fig. 3–55)?
