e same

and  
in this case,
For example, if you
push a loaded grocery cart a distance of 50 m by exerting a horizontal force of
30 N on the cart, you do  
of work on the cart.
As this example shows, in SI units work is measured in newton-meters
A special name is given to this unit, the joule (J):
[In the cgs system, the unit of work is called the erg and is defined as
In British units, work is measured in foot-pounds. Their
equivalence is

A force can be exerted on an object and yet do no work. If you hold a heavy
bag of groceries in your hands at rest, you do no work on it. You do exert a force
on the bag, but the displacement of the bag is zero, so the work done by you on
the bag is
You need both a force and a displacement to do work. You
also do no work on the bag of groceries if you carry it as you walk horizontally
across the floor at constant velocity, as shown in Fig. 6â€“2. No horizontal force is
required to move the bag at a constant velocity. The person shown
