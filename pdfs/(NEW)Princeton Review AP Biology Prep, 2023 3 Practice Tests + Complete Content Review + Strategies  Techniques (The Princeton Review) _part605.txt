e gene. This
causes them to have a phenotype that is the combination of all their genes. If a person has the bad luck to have more
than one mutated gene, then they could have more than one genetic disease at the same time.
b. Calculate the ratios of affected males and affected females for Disease 2.
There are 21 males and 5 are affected = 5/21
There are 20 females and 0 are affected = 0/20
c. Identify the likely inheritance patterns of Disease 1 and Disease 2.
Disease 1 is autosomal dominant
Disease 2 is X-linked recessive
d. Describe how inheritance patterns are shaped by the chromosomes upon which the genes are located.
If a gene is located on an X or a Y chromosome, then it will be inherited differently in males and female since males
have XY and females have XX. This is sex-linked inheritance. In this pedigree with X-linked recessive, the affected males
never have affected fathers. They get the mutated X from their mothers, but the mothers are never affected with the
disease themse
