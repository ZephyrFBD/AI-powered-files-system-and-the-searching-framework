n, describe one (or more, if time permits) of these operons: lac operon, trp operon, or how
CAP regulates lactose metabolism.
b. For this part of the question, you should describe how transcription factors work. If time permits, describe other
mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, RNA interference, and mRNA degradation.
Evolution
Review
In general, evolution is about changes in populations, species, or groups of species. More specifically, evolution is
the process by which the frequency of heritable traits in a population changes from one generation to the next. For
example, in one research study of Darwin finches, it was found that the average size of a bird beak (a heritable trait)
increased by 10% over a period of about one year. That was evolution.
An allele is one of several (or many) varieties of a gene. Individuals inherit alleles that code for traits that establish
morphology (form or structure), physiology, or behavior. Evolution is when the frequency of th
