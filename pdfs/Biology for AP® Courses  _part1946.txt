Pharmacogenomics will be able to provide a
counter-acting drug to decrease the effect of
Coumadin.
b.
Pharmacogenomics will test every patient for
their sensitivity to the drug.
c.
Pharmacogenomics will not be able to provide
any help to patients highly sensitive to the drug.
d.
Pharmacogenomics will provide an overdose to
each patient to test for the symptoms of the drug.
39. Why is so much effort being poured into genome
mapping applications?
a.
Genome mapping is necessary to know the base
pair difference between the markers.
b.
The mapping would help scientists understand
the role of proteins in specific organelles.
c.
The mapping technique identifies the role of
transposons.
d.
Genome mapping helps identify faulty alleles,
which could cause diseases.
