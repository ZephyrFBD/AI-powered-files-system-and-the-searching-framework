aﬀinity of an ATP-dependent enzyme in its non-phosphorylated and
phosphorylated state. Figure 1 shows the primary sequence of the
enzyme and its diﬀerent functional domains, where the numbers 1–4
denote the possible sites of phosphorylation. Which of the following
conclusions could most reasonably be made?
Figure 1. Primary sequence of the enzyme
Sites 2 and 3 are the most likely sites of phosphorylation, where
phosphorylation inhibits enzymatic activity and increases DNA
binding.
(A)
Sites 1 and 4 are the most likely sites of phosphorylation, where
phosphorylation increases DNA and substrate binding.
(B)
Sites 1 and 3 are the most likely sites of phosphorylation, where
phosphorylation inhibits enzymatic activity and increases DNA
binding.
(C)
Sites 1, 3, and 4 are the most likely sites of phosphorylation, where
phosphorylation increases enzymatic activity, substrate binding,
and DNA binding.
