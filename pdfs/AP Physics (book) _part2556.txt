al internal reflection is the principle behind fiber optics. Glass and plastic
fibers as thin as a few micrometers in diameter are commonly used. A bundle 
of such slender transparent fibers is called a light pipe or fiber-optic cable.
Light† can be transmitted along the fiber with almost no loss because of total internal
reflection. Figure 23–29 shows how light traveling down a thin fiber makes only
glancing collisions with the walls so that total internal reflection occurs. Even if
the light pipe is bent gently into a complicated shape, the critical angle still won’t be
exceeded, so light is transmitted practically undiminished to the other end. Very
small losses do occur, mainly by reflection at the ends and absorption within the fiber.
Important applications of fiber-optic cables are in communications and med-
icine. They are used in place of wire to carry telephone calls, video signals, and
computer data. The signal is a modulated light beam (a light beam whose intensity
