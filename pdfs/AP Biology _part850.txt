nction in the cell is to decompose
hydrogen peroxide, a by-product of cell respiration, into a less harmful
substance. Here is the reaction:
2H2O2→2H2O + O2↑
In this lab, the enzyme peroxidase (which can be extracted from turnips)
will be added to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As the H2O2 breaks down
into water and oxygen, a color change will be observed. You will analyze
this color change by either comparing the different resulting shades of
brown to premade reference tubes or by taking an absolute reading of the
light absorption from a spectrophotometer.
In a decomposition reaction of H2O2 by peroxidase, (as noted in the
formula provided earlier), the easiest molecule to measure is the final
product: oxygen. This is accomplished by using an indicator for the
presence of oxygen. The compound guaiacol instantly binds to oxygen to
form a compound that is brownish in color. The greater the amount of
oxygen gas that is present, the darker brown the solution will become.
