a few
microcoulombs. If that charge is 
by what percentage
does the mass of a 9.0-g comb change during charging?
6. (II) Two charged dust particles exert a force of 
on each other. What will be the force if they are moved so
they are only one-eighth as far apart?
7. (II) Two small charged spheres are 6.52 cm apart. They are
moved, and the force each exerts on the other is found to
have tripled. How far apart are they now?
8. (II) A person scuffing her feet on a wool rug on a dry day
accumulates a net charge of 
How many excess
electrons does she get, and by how much does her mass
increase?
9. (II) What is the total charge of all the electrons in a 12-kg
bar of gold? What is the net charge of the bar? (Gold has
79 electrons per atom and an atomic mass of 197 u.)
10. (II) Compare the electric force holding the electron in orbit
around the proton nucleus of the
hydrogen atom, with the gravitational force between the
same electron and proton. What is the ratio of these two
forces?
11. (II)
