e parent contributes the other.
With the exception of the sex chromosomes, homologous chromosomes contain the same genes, but these genes can have
different variations, called alleles. (For example, you might have inherited an allele for brown eyes from your father and
an allele for blue eyes from your mother.) As in mitosis, homologous chromosomes are duplicated during the S-stage
(synthesis) of interphase. However, unlike mitosis, in which there is just one nuclear division, meiosis has two complete
rounds of nuclear divisionâ€”meiosis I and meiosis II. These result in four nuclei and (usually) four daughter cells, each with
half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell (1n). The first division, meiosis I, separates homologous chromosomes,
and the second division, meiosis II, separates chromatids. (Remember: during meiosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides
TWICE, whereas in mitosis, DNA replicates ONCE but divides only ONCE.).
Although mitosis and meiosis are similar in many ways, t
