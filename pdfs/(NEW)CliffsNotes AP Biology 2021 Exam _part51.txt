Lipids
Lipids are a class of substances that are nearly insoluble in water (and other polar solvents) but are highly soluble in
nonpolar substances (like ether or chloroform). There are three major groups of lipids:
1. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) include fats and oils. They consist of
three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule (Figure 2-6). Fatty acids are hydrocarbons (chains of covalently
bonded carbons and hydrogens) with a carboxyl group (−COOH) at one end of the chain. Fatty acids vary in
structure by the number of carbons and by the placement of single and double covalent bonds between the carbons.
The double bond in a fatty acid creates a bend at the bond slightly spreading the triglyceride apart. As a result,
saturated fatty acids pack together more tightly, have higher melting temperatures, and are usually solid at room
temperature (fats); in contrast, unsaturated fatty acids pack together more lo
