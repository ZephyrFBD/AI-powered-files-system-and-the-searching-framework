(indicating the “normal” structure). When one CH3 group branches off the major 
chain, the common name of the isomer begins with iso-, and when two CH3 groups 
branch off, the common name begins with neo-. As the number of isomers grows, 
however, it becomes impossible to find a suitable prefix to denote each isomer by a 
common name. The need for a systematic means of naming organic compounds was 
recognized as early as 1892, when an organization called the International Union 
of Chemistry met in Geneva to formulate rules for naming organic substances. 
Since that time, the task of updating the rules for naming compounds has fallen to 
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Chemists every-
where, regardless of their nationality, subscribe to a common system for naming 
compounds.
The IUPAC names for the isomers of butane and pentane are the ones given first in 
Table 24.3. These systematic names, as well as t
