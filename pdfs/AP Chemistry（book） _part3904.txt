bonding arrangements of the atoms differ. Different iso-
mers are given different systematic names. The naming of hydrocar-
bons is based on the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the 
structure. The locations of alkyl groups, which branch off the chain, 
are specified by numbering along the carbon chain.
Alkanes with ring structures are called cycloalkanes. Alkanes 
are relatively unreactive. They do, however, undergo combustion 
in air, and their chief use is as sources of heat energy produced by 
combustion.
ALKENES, ALKYNES, AND AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (SEC-
TION 24.3) The names of alkenes and alkynes are based on the lon-
gest continuous chain of carbon atoms that contains the multiple 
bond, and the location of the multiple bond is specified by a numeri-
cal prefix. Alkenes exhibit not only structural isomerism but geomet-
ric (cisâ€“trans) isomerism as well. In geometric isomers, the bonds are 
the same, but the molecules have different geometries. Geometric 
isomerism is p
