∆H when 9.25 * 10-4 mol of AgCl dis-
solves in water.
 5.46 At one time, a common means of forming small quantities of 
oxygen gas in the laboratory was to heat KClO3:
 
 
2 KClO31s2 ¡ 2 KCl1s2 + 3 O21g2 ∆H = -89.4 kJ
 
 For this reaction, calculate ∆H for the formation of (a) 1.36 mol 
of O2 and (b) 10.4 g of KCl. (c) The decomposition of KClO3 
proceeds spontaneously when it is heated. Do you think 
that the reverse reaction, the formation of KClO3 from KCl 
and O2, is likely to be feasible under ordinary conditions? 
 
Explain your answer.
 5.47 Consider the combustion of liquid methanol, CH3OH1l2:
 
 CH3OH1l2 + 3
2 O21g2 ¡  CO21g2 + 2 H2O1l2 
∆H = -726.5 kJ
 
 (a) What is the enthalpy change for the reverse reaction? 
(b) Balance the forward reaction with whole-number co-
efficients. What is ∆H for the reaction represented by this 
equation? (c) Which is more likely to be thermodynami-
cally favored, the forward reaction or the reverse reaction? 
(d) If the reaction were written to
