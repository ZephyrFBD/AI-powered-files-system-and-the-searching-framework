▶Practice Exercise 1
If a balloon is expanded from 0.055 to 1.403 L against an exter-
nal pressure of 1.02 atm, how many L-atm of work is done?  
(a) -0.056 L-atm (b) -1.37 L-atm (c) 1.43 L-atm (d) 1.49 L-atm  
(e) 139 L-atm
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the work, in J, if the volume of a system contracts from 
1.55 to 0.85 L at a constant pressure of 0.985 atm.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given an initial volume and a final volume from 
which we can calculate ∆V. We are also given the pressure, P. We 
are asked to calculate work, w.
Plan The equation w = -P ∆V allows us to calculate the work 
done by the system from the given information.
Solve The volume change is
∆V = Vfinal - Vinitial = 0.980 L - 0.250 L = 0.730 L
Thus, the quantity of work is
w = -P∆V = -11.35 atm210.730 L2 = -0.9855 L@atm
Converting L-atm to J, we have
-10.9855 L@atm2a 101.3 J
1 L@atmb = -99.8 J
