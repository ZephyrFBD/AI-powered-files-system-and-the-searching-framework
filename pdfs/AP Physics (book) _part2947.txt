MASS RELATED
TO ENERGY
Energy from nuclear decay. The energy required or
released in nuclear reactions and decays comes from a change in mass between
the initial and final particles. In one type of radioactive decay (Chapter 30),
an atom of uranium 
decays to an atom of thorium
plus an atom of helium 
where the masses
given are in atomic mass units 
Calculate the energy
released in this decay.
APPROACH The initial mass minus the total final mass gives the mass loss in
atomic mass units (u); we convert that to kg, and multiply by 
to find the
energy released,
SOLUTION The initial mass is 232.03716 u, and after the decay the mass is
so there is a loss of mass of 0.00582 u.
This mass, which equals 
is
changed into energy. By 
we have
Since
(Section 17–4), the energy released is 5.4 MeV.
In the tiny world of atoms and nuclei, it is common to quote energies in eV
(electron volts) or multiples such as MeV
