(RBE) of a given type of radiation is defined as the number of rads of X-ray or 
radiation that produces the same biological damage as 1 rad of the given
radiation. For example, 1 rad of slow neutrons does the same damage as 5 rads of
X-rays. Table 31–1 gives the RBE for several types of radiation. The numbers are
approximate because they depend somewhat on the energy of the particles and
on the type of damage that is used as the criterion.
The effective dose can be given as the product of the dose in rads and the
RBE, and this unit is known as the rem (which stands for rad equivalent man):
(31;10a)
This unit is being replaced by the SI unit for “effective dose,” the sievert (Sv):
(31;10b)

or
By these definitions, 1 rem (or 1 Sv) of any type of radiation does approximately
the same amount of biological damage. For example, 50 rem of fast neutrons does
the same damage as 50 rem of rays. But note that 50 rem of fast neutrons is only
5 rads, whereas 50 rem of rays is 50 rads.
