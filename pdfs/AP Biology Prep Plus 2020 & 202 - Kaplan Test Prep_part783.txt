18.5 Investigate how behavior aﬀects survival
From observations, generate your own hypotheses to explore other
factors (sex, age, diﬀerent colors of light, ripeness of fruit, mutations) that
aﬀect fruit fly behavior. To verify the results, you need to conduct several
trials and change the positions of the stimuli in the chamber. Quantify
and express your results graphically. Then complete a chi-square analysis
and construct a preference table to identify and compare the preferences
of fruit flies. Your goal is to identify a pattern in the behavior of fruit flies
and which of the responses (geotaxis, chemotaxis, or phototaxis) is the
strongest. Potential challenges may include diﬀiculty in counting fruit
flies accurately and fruit flies escaping the choice chamber.
