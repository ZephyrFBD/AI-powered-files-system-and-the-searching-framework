22. Voltage-gated ion channels are essential for producing
an action potential and returning a neuron to its resting
state. Why would it be impossible to trigger an action
potential without voltage-gated ion channels?
a.
The cell would not undergo depolarization,
which is necessary to fire an action potential and
then return the cell to the resting state.
b.
The cell would not undergo repolarization,
which is necessary to fire an action potential and
then return the cell to the resting state.
c.
The cell would not undergo depolarization,
repolarization, and hyperpolarization, which are
necessary to fire an action potential and then
return the cell to the resting state.
d.
Th
