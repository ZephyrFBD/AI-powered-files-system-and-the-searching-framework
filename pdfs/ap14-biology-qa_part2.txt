 to herbivores. Students were presented with the sample mean trichome 
densities and standard error of the means (SEM) of three populations of plants. Students were asked to 
appropriately graph the means, including the 95percent confidence intervals (+ 2Ã—SEM) for each of the 
three samples. Students were then asked to identify the two populations most likely to be significantly 
different, and to justify the difference based on an analysis of the sample means and standard errors of the 
mean. Students were then asked to design a plan to test the hypothesis that trichomes provide protection 
from herbivory and are a phenotype that is acted on by natural selection. For the experimental design, 
students were asked to describe an independent variable, a dependent variable, and an appropriate control 
treatment, as well as to identify the appropriate duration of the experiment to ensure that natural selection 
is measured. Finally, students were asked to select the kind of data necessary
