 microcosm. A major limitation
to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem
through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. These changes are often due to differences in species
numbers and diversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or re-creating (microcosm)
the natural habitat. Thus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem
from which they were gathered.
As both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems
should be used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem
structure, function, and dynamics.
Scientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure
and dynamics of ecosystems. Three basic types of ecosyst
