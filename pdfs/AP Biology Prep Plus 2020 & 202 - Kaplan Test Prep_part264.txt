 spontaneously in nature
and result from mutations during cell division, meiotic or mitotic failures,
and the fusion of gametes. Combining two diploid cells, for instance,
results in a tetraploid, and combining a diploid and haploid cell results in
a triploid. 
Polyploidy may arise from two closely related species (autopolyploidy) or
two diﬀerent species (allopolyploidy). Normally, hybrids are sterile
because they do not have homologous pairs of chromosomes needed for
gamete formation during meiosis. In some instances, polyploidization
results in each chromosome having a homologue from the additional set
of chromosomes, so meiosis can occur and the hybrid becomes fertile.
Note that sterile polyploids can propagate via asexual reproduction.
Polyploids like allotetraploids also have increased heterozygosity (varied
sets of a chromosome) and thus adaptive advantages to changes in the
environment. The diﬀerent copies of a gene may each express a diﬀerent
phenotype and result in a new trait
