Male Hormones
At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
hormone (LH) into the male system for the first time. FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin
facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated in Figure 34.16. LH also enters the testes and stimulates
the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood.
Testosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adol
