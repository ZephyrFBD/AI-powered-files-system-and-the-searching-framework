into protobionts. Further organization eventually led to the creation of the
first cells. This matches (D). While (A) and (B) are accurate, both are
incorrect because they are components of bigger theories. (C) is incorrect
because this is referred to as the RNA world hypothesis.

According to the chart, the pillbugs seem to have no preference between
the leȇ chamber and the right chamber in Experiment 1, and thus are
demonstrating kinesis, or random movement in response to a stimulus. In
the second experiment, however, the pillbugs are shown to preferentially
move towards the acidic chamber, which describes positive taxis, or an
attraction towards a stimulus. These observations match (A); eliminate
(B), (C), and (D).

According to Mendel’s law of segregation, allele pairs separate
independently of each other during gamete formation and randomly unite
at fertilization. The graph for Mendelian segregation shows an equal split
among the four possible genotypes. The graph
