NA.
This changes how a gene is expressed. Polar ligands, on the other hand, interact with membrane receptor protein. Some
membrane receptors work by changing conformation so that certain ions, such as Na+ and K+, can pass through the plasma
membrane. Other membrane receptors interact with a G-protein on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which
causes a series of reactions inside the cell. Disruptions to this process are linked to several diseases, including cholera.
It is important to keep in mind that each cell has a variety of receptors, allowing it to respond to a variety of stimuli. Some
receptors can bind several different ligands; for example, odorant molecules/receptors associated with the sense of smell in
animals. Once the signaling molecule and receptor interact, a cascade of events called signal transduction usually amplifies
the signal inside the cell.
