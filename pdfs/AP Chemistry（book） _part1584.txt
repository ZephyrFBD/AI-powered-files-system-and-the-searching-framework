perature 1450 째C2.
Plan The volume and number of moles of gas do not change, so 
we must use a relationship connecting pressure and temperature. 
Converting temperature to the Kelvin scale and tabulating the 
given information, we have

Solve To determine how P and T are related, we start with the  
ideal-gas equation and isolate the quantities that do not change (n, 
V, and R) on one side and the variables (P and T) on the other side.

Because the quotient P>T is a constant, we can write

The gas pressure in an aerosol can is 1.5 atm at 25 째C. Assuming that the gas obeys the ideal-gas equation, what is the 
pressure when the can is heated to 450 째C?
