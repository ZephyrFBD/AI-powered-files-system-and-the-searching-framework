J/kg of tissue. It is the SI 
unit of radiation dose. The rad is a smaller unit; 100 rad = 1 Gy. The 
effective dose, which measures the biological damage created by the 
deposited energy, is measured in units of rem or sievert (Sv). The rem 
is obtained by multiplying the number of rad by the relative biologi-
cal effectiveness (RBE); 100 rem = 1 Sv.
