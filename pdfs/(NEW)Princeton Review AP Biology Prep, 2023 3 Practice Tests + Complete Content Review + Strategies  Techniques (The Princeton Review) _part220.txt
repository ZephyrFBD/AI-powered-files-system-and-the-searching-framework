s only one kind of reaction. This is known as enzyme specificity. Because of this,
enzymes are usually named after the molecules they target. In enzymatic reactions, the targeted molecules are
known as substrates. For example, maltose, a disaccharide, can be broken down into two glucose molecules. Our
substrate, maltose, gives its name to the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction: maltase.
Many enzymes are named simply by replacing the suffix of the substrate with -ase. Using this nomenclature,
maltose becomes maltase.
Enzyme-Substrate Complex
Enzymes have a unique way of helping reactions along. As we just saw, the reactants in an enzyme-assisted reaction
are known as substrates. During a reaction, the enzymeâ€™s job is to bring the transition state about by helping the
substrate(s) get into position. It accomplishes this through a special region on the enzyme known as an active site.
The enzyme temporarily binds one or more of the substrates to its active site and forms an enzyme-substra
