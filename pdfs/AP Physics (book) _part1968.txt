†A useful analogy compares the flow of electric charge in a wire to the flow of water in a river, or in a
pipe, acted on by gravity. If the river (or pipe) is nearly level, the flow rate is small. But if one end is
somewhat higher than the other, the water flow rate—or current—is greater. The greater the differ-
ence in height, the swifter the current. We saw in Chapter 17 that electric potential is analogous to the
height of a cliff for gravity. Just as an increase in height can cause a greater flow of water, so a greater
electric potential difference, or voltage, causes a greater electric current. Resistance in a wire is analogous
to rocks in a river that retard water flow.
