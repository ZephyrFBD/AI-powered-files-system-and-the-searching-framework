ds from the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result.
Figure 9.7 Transmitted primarily through contaminated drinking water, cholera is a major cause of death in the
developing world and in areas where natural disasters interrupt the availability of clean water. The cholera bacterium,
Vibrio cholerae, creates a toxin that modifies G-protein-mediated cell signaling pathways in the intestines. Modern
sanitation eliminates the threat of cholera outbreaks, such as the one that swept through New York City in 1866. This

Enzyme-linked receptors are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme. In
some cases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme. Other enzyme-linked receptors have a small
intracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme. The enzyme-linked recepto
