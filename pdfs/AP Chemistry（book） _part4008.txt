 the detailed calculations: Na, 2.51; K, 3.49. (d) Both approxi-
mations give the same value of Zeff for Na and K; neither accounts for 
the gradual increase in Zeff moving down a group. (e) Following the 
trend from detailed calculations, we predict a Zeff value of approxi-
mately 4.5. 7.17 The n = 3 electrons in Kr experience a greater effec-
tive nuclear charge and thus have a greater probability of being closer 
to the nucleus. 7.19 Quantity (b) must be measured to determine the 
bonding atomic radius of an atom. 7.21 (a) 1.37 Å (b) The distance 
between W atoms will decrease. 7.23 From the sum of the atomic 
radii, As—I = 2.58 Å. This is very close to the experimental value 
of 2.55 Å. 7.25 (a) Cs 7 K 7 Li (b) Pb 7 Sn 7 Si (c) N 7 O 7 F
