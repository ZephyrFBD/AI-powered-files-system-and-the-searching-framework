mmunity, ecosystem, biome, and biosphere.
Populations are all the organisms that occur in a specific habitat, and
communities are all the populations that live in that habitat. Ecosystems
encompass communities and their abiotic environment, including their
interactions through which nutrients and energy flow. The role and
position a species has in an ecosystem and its interactions with abiotic
and biotic factors of the environment is called an ecological niche.
Ecosystems within a specific geographic region form biomes, and
together all ecosystems form a complex web that make up the biosphere.
An ecosystem can be a tropical rain forest, an entire mountain range, or a
coral reef, but can also be an ephemeral pool of water in the middle of
the desert. Due to limiting factors, such as food, nutrients, land, water,
and sunlight, ecosystems are unable to support an unlimited number of
organisms. The health and balance of ecosystems are sustained by the
biodiversity of the ecosystem. Biodive
