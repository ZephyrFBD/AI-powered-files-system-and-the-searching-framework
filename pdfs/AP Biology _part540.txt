Pesticides vs. Biological Control
Scientists have developed a variety of pesticides, chemicals that kill
organisms that we consider to be undesirable. These pesticides include

killing animals that carry and cause diseases like bubonic plague (diseased
rats) and malaria (Anopheles mosquitoes). On the other hand, exposure to
pesticides can cause cancer in humans.
