molar heats of vaporization 
for several organic compounds. Use speciﬁc examples from 
this list to illustrate how the heat of vaporization varies 
with (a) molar mass, (b) molecular shape, (c) molecular 
polarity, (d) hydrogen-bonding interactions. Explain these 
comparisons in terms of the nature of the intermolecular 
forces at work. (You may ﬁnd it helpful to draw out the 
structural formula for each compound.)

 11.93  The vapor pressure of ethanol (C2H5OH) at 19 °C is 40.0 
torr. A 1.00-g sample of ethanol is placed in a 2.00 L con-
tainer at 19 °C. If the container is closed and the ethanol 
is allowed to reach equilibrium with its vapor, how many 
grams of liquid ethanol remain?
 11.94  Liquid butane 1C4H102 is stored in cylinders to be used as a 
fuel. The normal boiling point of butane is listed as -0.5 °C.
