of HCl and H2O to moles and then 
use Equation 13.7:
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The solubility of oxygen gas in water at 40 °C is 1.0 mmol per liter 
of solution. What is this concentration in units of mole fraction?
(a) 1.00 * 10-6 (b) 1.80 * 10-5 (c) 1.00 * 10-2 
(d) 1.80 * 10-2 (e) 5.55 * 10-2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
A commercial bleach solution contains 3.62% by mass of 
NaOCl in water. Calculate (a) the mole fraction and (b) the 
molality of NaOCl in the solution.
Moles HCl = 136 g HCl2a 1 mol HCl
36.5 g HCl b = 0.99 mol HCl
Moles H2O = 164 g H2O2a
1 mol H2O
18 g H2O b = 3.6 mol H2O
XHCl =
moles HCl
moles H2O + moles HCl =
0.99
3.6 + 0.99 = 0.99
4.6 = 0.22
Molality of HCl = 0.99 mol HCl
0.064 kg H2O = 15 m
(b) To calculate the molality of HCl in the solution, 
we use Equation 13.9. We calculated the number 
of moles of HCl in part (a), and the mass of sol-
vent is 64 g = 0.064 kg:
Notice that we can’t readily calculate the molar-
ity of the solution because we don’t know the 
volume of
