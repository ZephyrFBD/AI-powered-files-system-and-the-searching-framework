atomic orbitals overlapping side to side (b) i, s@type MO; ii, s@type 
MO; iii, p@type MO (c) i, antibonding; ii, bonding; iii, antibonding 
(d) i, the nodal plane is between the atom centers, perpendicular to 
the interatomic axis and equidistant from each atom. ii, there are two 
nodal planes; both are perpendicular to the interatomic axis. One 
is left of the left atom and the second is right of the right atom. iii, 
there are two nodal planes; one is between the atom centers, perpen-
dicular to the interatomic axis and equidistant from each atom. The 
second contains the interatomic axis and is perpendicular to the Ô¨Årst.  
9.13 (a) In a linear AB2 molecule, there can be either 0 or 3 non-
bonding electron pairs. (b) three (c) yes 9.15 A molecule with 
tetrahedral molecular geometry has an atom at each vertex of the tet-
rahedron. A trigonal-pyramidal molecule has one vertex of the tetra-
hedron occupied by a nonbonding electron pair rather than an atom.
