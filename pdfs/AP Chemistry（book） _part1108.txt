atomic number 20) has the electron conﬁguration 
3Ar44s2. To form a 2+ ion, the two outer 4s electrons must be 
removed, giving an ion that is isoelectronic with Ar:
Ca2+: 3Ar4
(b) Cobalt (atomic number 27) has the electron conﬁgura-
tion 3Ar44s23d7. To form a 3+ ion, three electrons must 
be  
removed. As discussed in the text, the 4s electrons are 
 
removed before the 3d electrons. Consequently, we remove 
the two 4s electrons and one of the 3d electrons, and the elec-
tron  
conﬁguration for Co3 +  is
Co3 +: 3Ar43d6
(c) Sulfur (atomic number 16) has the electron conﬁguration 
3Ne43s23p4. To form a 2- ion, two electrons must be added. 
There is room for two additional electrons in the 3p orbitals. 
Thus, the S2 -  electron conﬁguration is
S2 -: 3Ne43s23p6 = 3Ar4
Comment Remember that many of the common ions of the s- and 
p-block elements, such as Ca2 +  and S2 -, have the same number of 
electrons as the closest noble gas. (Section 2.7)
