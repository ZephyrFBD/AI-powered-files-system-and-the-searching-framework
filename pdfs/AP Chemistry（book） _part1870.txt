Give It Some Thought
Would you expect the alloy PdB0.15 to be a substitutional alloy or an interstitial 
alloy?
One of the most important iron alloys is stainless steel, which contains about 0.4% 
carbon, 18% chromium, and 1% nickel. The ratio of elements present in the steel may 
vary over a wide range, imparting a variety of specific physical and chemical properties 
to the materials.
In a heterogeneous alloy, the components are not dispersed uniformly. For example, 
the heterogeneous alloy pearlite contains two phases (Figure 12.16). One phase is essentially 
pure body-centered cubic iron, and the other is the compound Fe3C, known as cementite. 
In general, the properties of heterogeneous alloys depend on both the composition and the 
manner in which the solid
