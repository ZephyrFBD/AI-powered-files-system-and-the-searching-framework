energy. (C) is incorrect
because the energy input required to reach the transition state with or
without an enzyme is released when the product is formed, so the free
energy change of the reaction does not change. (D) is incorrect
because, although the enzyme-substrate complex facilitates the
formation of the transition state, the free energy change of the
reaction does not increase or decrease.
10. B
Learning Objective: 9.3
Noncompetitive inhibition reduces Vmax because it reduces the
concentration of active enzyme. It, however, does not change Km,
which is the amount of substrate needed to reach half Vmax and
measures the aﬀinity of an active enzyme for its substrate. Competitive
inhibition increases Km by interfering with the binding of the substrate,
so more substrate is needed to outcompete the inhibitor to reach Vmax,
which is unchanged. The steeper slope in the graph also demonstrates
that Km is higher in competitive inhibition. Thus, the correct answer is
(B). (A) is incorrect
