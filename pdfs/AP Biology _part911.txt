Four vials were set up to investigate bacterial transformation. Vials 1 and 2 each contained E. coli
bacteria that had been made competent and had then been mixed with a plasmid containing the gene
for ampicillin (pAMP) resistance. Vials 3 and 4 both contained E. coli that had also been made
competent but had not been mixed with a plasmid. Each vial of bacteria was poured onto a nutrient
agar plate. Vials 1 and 3 were poured onto plates that contained the antibiotic ampicillin. Vials 2
and 4 were poured onto plates that did not contain ampicillin.
The figure below shows what the nutrient agar plates looked like. The
