use water to flow out of the human cells into the
seawater that was consumed.
(B) The lower water potential in the human cells would cause NaCl to flow out of the human cells into the
seawater that was consumed.
(C) The higher water potential in the human cells would cause water to flow out of the human cells into the
seawater that was consumed.
(D) The higher water potential in the human cells would cause NaCl to flow out of the human cells into the
seawater that was consumed.
10. A dandelion plant is growing in an environment with a temperature of 21°C. The water potential in the root
cells of a dandelion plant is –1.2 bars. If a 0.1 molar sodium chloride solution at 21°C was poured on the
dandelion roots, what would be the most likely result?
(a) Sodium chloride would move into the dandelion cells, raising the water potential of the dandelion cells.
(b) Water would flow out of the dandelion cells because the water potential in the dandelion cells would be
higher than the water poten
