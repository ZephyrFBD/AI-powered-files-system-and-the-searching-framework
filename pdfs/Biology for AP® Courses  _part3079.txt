rs strengthens the
synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
Long-term Depression (LTD)
Long-term depression (LTD) is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection.
One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA
receptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic
membrane, as illustrated in Figure 26.18. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron
less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just
as important for learning and memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant
connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.
