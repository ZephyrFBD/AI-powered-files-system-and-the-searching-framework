SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY AND
AMPLIFICATION CASCADE IN THE EYE
The sensory phase of vision begins when photons of light pass through the
lens, which focuses the light onto the retina. The retina consists of several
layers of neurons. When light strikes the retina, it is absorbed by
photoreceptors in some of those neuronsâ€”rods (black and white vision)
and cones (color vision). These rods and cones are embedded with the
light-absorbing pigment retinal. While in a photoreceptor, each photon
causes a change in the shape of retinal from cis to trans, which results in
the excitement of the visual pigment rhodopsin. This triggers a familiar
mechanism, a signal transduction pathway and amplification cascade.
The stimulation of retinal activates a G protein-signaling mechanism that
ultimately alters the membrane potential a
