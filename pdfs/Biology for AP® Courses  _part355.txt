onds in the hydrocarbon chain. If only single bonds are
present, they are known as saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids may have one or more double bonds in the
hydrocarbon chain. Phospholipids make up the matrix of membranes. They have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to
which two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached. Steroids are another class of lipids. Their basic
structure has four fused carbon rings. Cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma
membrane, where it helps to maintain the fluid nature of the membrane. It is also the precursor of steroid hormones such
as testosterone.
3.4 Proteins
Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by
providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones. The building blocks of proteins (monomers)
are amino acids. Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an ami
