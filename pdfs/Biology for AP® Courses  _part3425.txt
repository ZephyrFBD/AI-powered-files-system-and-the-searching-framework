a.
Lipid-derived hormones have receptors located
in the nucleus, and thus utilize intracellular
receptors, whereas peptide and amino acid-
derived hormones have receptors only on the
surface of the cell.
b.
Lipid-derived hormones can permeate the
plasma membrane and thus utilize intracellular
receptors. Peptide and amino acid- derived
hormones are lipid insoluble and thus require
cell surface receptors.
c.
Lipid-derived hormones can permeate plasma
membranes as they need to remain in circulation
for a longer duration. Peptide and amino acid-
derived hormones are lipid insoluble and need
surface receptors.
d.
Lipid-derived hormones can permeate plasma
membranes and thus utilize intracellular
receptors. Some peptide and amino acid-derived
hormones can cross the membrane but most are
lipid insoluble and thus require cell surface
receptors.
