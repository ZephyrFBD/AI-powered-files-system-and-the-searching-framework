(a) Use data in Appendix C to calculate ∆H° and ∆S° for 
this reaction. (b) Will ∆G for the reaction increase, de-
crease, or stay unchanged with increasing temperature? 
(c) Calculate ∆G° at 298 K. Under standard conditions, 
is the reaction spontaneous at this temperature? (d) Is 
there a temperature at which the reaction would be at 
equilibrium under standard conditions and that is low 
enough so that the compounds involved are likely to be 
stable?
 19.71  (a) Use data in Appendix C to estimate the boiling point 
of benzene, C6H61l2. (b) Use a reference source, such as the 
CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, to find the experi-
mental boiling point of benzene.
 19.72  (a) Using data in Appendix C, estimate the temperature 
at which the free-energy change for the transformation 
from I21s2 to I21g2 is zero. (b) Use a reference source, 
such as Web Elements (www.webelements.com), to 
find the experimental melting
