indophenol (DCPIP) is a chemical dye. When DCPIP is chemically reduced, it changes color from 
blue to clear. DCPIP can be used as an electron acceptor in experiments that measure the rate of electron transport 
through the electron transport chain. A student performed an experiment to study the effects of a chemical, DCMU, 
on photosynthesis. 
The student prepared four tubes with a liquid buffer and chloroplasts that had been extracted from spinach leaves. 
The student then added DCPIP to three of the tubes and added DCMU to one of them. Additionally, tube 3 was 
wrapped in tin foil. The contents of each tube are shown in the table. The student then incubated each tube for 60 
minutes and measured the absorbance (A600) of each solution at five-minute intervals. The absorbance readings of 
each solution are shown in Figure 1. 
Tube 1: Buffer and water 
Tube 2: DCPIP, buffer, and water 
Tube 3: DCPIP, buffer, and water
(wrapped in foil) 
Tube 4: DCPIP, buffer, and 
1.0 mM DCMU
