(D) The solution is yellow when it contains a lot of CO2. As
photosynthesis uses up the CO2 in the solution, the solution and
indicator will turn from yellow to green and then to blue. The colors
of light that provide the most energy for photosynthesis are violet
and red. Green light is reflected and thus provides no energy for
photosynthesis. Sunlight contains all the colors of light; some
provide a lot of energy for plants, and others do not. However, a
beam of focused red light contains the most energy, even more so
than sunlight, and
