42. The rotational absorption spectrum of a molecule displays
peaks about 
apart. Determine the moment
of inertia of this molecule.
43. For 
with a bond length of 0.121 nm, what is the moment
of inertia about the center of mass?
44. Must we consider quantum effects for everyday rotating
objects? Estimate the differences between rotational energy
levels for a spinning baton compared to the energy of the
baton. Assume the baton consists of a uniform 32-cm-long
bar with a mass of 230 g and two small end masses, each of
mass 380 g, and it rotates at 
about the bar’s center.
45. For a certain semiconductor, the longest wavelength 
radiation that can be absorbed is 2.06 mm. What is the
energy gap in this semiconductor?
46. When EM radiation is incident on diamond,
