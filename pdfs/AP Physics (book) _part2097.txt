 for the capacitor’s 
voltage (and charge) to reach 63% of the maximum. This can be checked‡
using any calculator with an 
key:
so for

In a circuit, for example, where

the time constant is
If the resistance is much smaller, the time constant is much smaller and
the capacitor becomes charged much more quickly. This makes sense, because 
a lower resistance will retard the flow of charge less. All circuits contain some
resistance (if only in the connecting wires), so a capacitor can never be charged
instantaneously when connected to a battery.
Finally, what is the voltage 
across the resistor in Fig. 19–20a? The imposed
battery voltage is 
so
This is called an exponential decay. The current I flowing in the circuit is that 
flowing through the resistor and is also an exponential decay:
(19;7d)
When the switch of the circuit in Fig. 19–20a is closed, the current is largest at
first because there is no charge on the capacitor to impede it. As charge builds on
the capacitor, the cu
