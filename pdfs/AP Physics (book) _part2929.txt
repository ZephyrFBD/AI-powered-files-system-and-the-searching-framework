Time dilation, if not accounted for, would introduce an error of about 1 part 
in 
which is 1000 times greater than the precision of the atomic clocks. Not
correcting for time dilation means a receiver could give much poorer position
accuracy.
NOTE GPS devices must make other corrections as well, including effects
associated with general relativity.

Time intervals are not the only things different in different reference frames.
Space intervals—lengths and distances—are different as well, according to the 
special theory of relativity, and we il
