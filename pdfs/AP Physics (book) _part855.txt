diver in Fig. 8–28, for example, is not zero (gravity is acting), but the net torque
about her CM is zero because the force of gravity acts at her center of mass.

Clutch. A simple clutch consists of two cylindrical plates
that can be pressed together to connect two sections of an axle, as needed, in 
a piece of machinery. The two plates have masses
and
with equal radii 
They are initially separated (Fig. 8–29). Plate 
is accelerated from rest to an angular velocity 
in time 
Calculate (a) the angular momentum of 
and (b) the torque required to
accelerate 
from rest to 
(c) Next, plate 
initially at rest but 
free to rotate without friction, is placed in firm contact with freely rotating 
plate 
and the two plates then both rotate at a constant angular velocity 
which is considerably less than 
Why does this happen, and what is 
APPROACH We use angular momentum,
(Eq. 8–18), plus Newton’s
second law for rotation, Eq. 8–19.
SOLUTION (a) The angular momentum of 
a cylinder, is
(b)
