my books) while cows and other farm animals are eliminated.

carbon emission targets would mean for farm animals in Australia
alone if emissions were reduced as demanded by 35 percent by 2030
and zero by 2050:
Well, let’s take agriculture, the total emissions from agriculture are about 75 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide, equivalent. Now reduce that by 35 percent and you have to come down to
50 million tonnes, I’ve done the maths. So if you take for example 1.5 million cows, you’re
going to have to reduce the herd by 525,000 [by] 2030, nine years, that’s 58,000 cows a year.
The beef herd’s 30 million, reduce that by 35 percent, that’s 10.5 million, which means 1.2
million cattle have to go every year between now and 2030. This is insanity!
There are 75 million sheep. Reduce that by 35 p
