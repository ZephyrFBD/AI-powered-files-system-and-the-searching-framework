ing such abnormalities.
b.
Aberrations caused when a pair of homologous chromosomes fails to separate during anaphase I or when
sister chromatids fail to separate during anaphase II, the daughter cells will inherit unequal numbers of
chromosomes.
c.
Errors during anaphase I of meiosis only cause such aberrations resulting in unequal numbers of
chromosomes.
d.
Errors during meiosis introduce variations in the DNA sequence, which depends specifically on the size of
the variant only.
Meiosis II
In some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before entering meiosis II. Interkinesis lacks an S phase,
so chromosomes are not duplicated. The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony.
During meiosis II, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. The
mechanics of meiosis II is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes.
Therefore, each
