 virus “hides” in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against,
and immunity to the virus slowly declines. Under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological
stress, the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions
associated with the disease. Once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response
is again stimulated and resolves the skin lesions in a few days by destroying viruses in the skin. As a result of this type
of replicative cycle, appearances of cold sores outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the
nervous tissue for life. Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicella-zoster virus
that causes chickenpox. After having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for
