aving to build 
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP 
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments – the 
Personal Progress Checks – that they can assign their students at the end 
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However, 
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course 
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these 
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.
