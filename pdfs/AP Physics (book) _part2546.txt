 of incidence. Angle 
is the angle of refraction, the angle the refracted ray
makes with the normal to the surface. Notice that the ray bends toward the normal
when entering the water. This is always the case when the ray enters a medium where
the speed of light is less (and the index of refraction is greater, Eq. 23–4). If light
travels from one medium into a second where its speed is greater, the ray bends away
from the normal; this is shown in Fig. 23–21b for a ray traveling from water to air.
