CHEMICAL EQUATIONS (INTRODUCTION AND SECTION 3.1) 
 
The study of the quantitative relationships between chemical 
 
formulas and chemical equations is known as stoichiometry. One of 
the  
important concepts of stoichiometry is the law of conservation 
of mass, which states that the total mass of the products of a chem-
ical reaction is the same as the total mass of the reactants. The same 
numbers of atoms of each type are present before and after a chem-
ical  
reaction. A balanced chemical equation shows equal numbers of 
atoms of each element on each side of the equation. Equations are 
balanced by placing coefficients in front of the chemical formu-
las for the reactants and products of a reaction, not by changing the 
 
subscripts in  
chemical formulas.
SIMPLE PATTERNS OF CHEMICAL REACTIVITY (SECTION 3.2) 
 
Among the reaction types described in this chapter are (1) combination 
 
reactions, in which two reactants combine to form one product; 
 
(2)
