transcription factors involved in
essential reactions. Signaling cascades involving G-proteins can be very
complex and involve many diﬀerent enzymes and conversions, which
prevents the reactions from running out of control.
Enzyme-linked receptors can act directly as enzymes, catalyzing a reaction
inside the cell, or they can be associated with enzymes that they activate
within the cell. Most enzyme-linked receptors turn on a special class of
enzymes called protein kinases, which add free-floating phosphate
groups to proteins, regulating their activity. Protein phosphorylation is an
essential means of intracellular signaling and control, as proteins become
activated or deactivated simply by the addition or removal of
phosphates. Protein kinases oȇen target other protein kinases, initiating

a cascade of kinase activity. Protein phosphatases reverse the action of
protein kinases.
G-protein-linked and enzyme-linked receptors use complex relays of
