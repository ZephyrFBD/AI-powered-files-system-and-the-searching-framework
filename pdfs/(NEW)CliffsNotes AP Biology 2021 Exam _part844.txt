gized by
light energy, passed to a special chlorophyll a (P700), and then passed to a
primary electron acceptor. The two electrons are then used to reduce
 
NADP+. With H+ (from the splitting of H2O), NADPH is formed.
 
NADPH then supplies energy for the fixation of CO2 during the
Calvin cycle. In this experiment, DPIP is added so that the process can be visualized. As oxidized DPIP is energized
by electrons from photosystem I to form reduced DPIP, DPIP turns from blue to clear.
