ide the operon region, produces a regulatory protein that engages the operator
region and governs whether RNA polymerase can attach to the promoter region and begin transcription. Regulatory
proteins are allosteric, that is, they become active (or inactive) only when they bind to some specific substrate
molecule. A regulatory protein can be one of two kinds.
A repressor protein blocks the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter region. Repressor proteins
characterize negative regulation because they must be inactive in order for transcription to occur.
An activator protein promotes the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter region. Activator proteins
characterize positive regulation because they must be active in order for transcription to occur.
Three examples of gene regulation in bacteria follow (summarized in Figure 9-7):
1. The trp operon in E. coli produces enzymes for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. A regulatory gene
produces an inactive repressor that doe
