78. Some desert plants have taproots that extend up to
20-30 feet underground. Others have fibrous root systems
that cover wide areas. What are the advantages of a deep
taproot and the advantages of a fibrous root system in a
desert?
a.
A deep taproot can reach the deeper soil regions
that stay moist after several rainfalls. A shallow
fibrous system provides additional support to
anchor the plant in the desert.
b.
A deep taproot provides additional support to
anchor the plant in the desert. A shallow fibrous
system increases the amount of water that can be
absorbed after a light rainfall when the soil dries
quickly in the desert.
c.
A deep taproot increases the amount of water
that can be abso
