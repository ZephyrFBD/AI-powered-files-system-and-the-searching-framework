 of which there were tiny negatively charged
electrons, a little like plums in a pudding, Fig. 27–18.
Around 1911, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) and his colleagues performed
experiments whose results contradicted the plum-pudding model of the atom. In
these experiments a beam of positively charged alpha 
particles was directed
at a thin sheet of metal foil such as gold, Fig. 27–19. (These newly discovered 
particles were emitted by certain radioactive materials and were soon shown 
to be doubly ionized helium atoms—that is, having a charge of 
) It was
