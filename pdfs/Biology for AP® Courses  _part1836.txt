 demethylated and the acetylated forms of
the DNA are reversed when the silenced gene is
expressed.
c.
The drug methylates and acetylates the silenced
genes to turn them back “on”.
d.
Drugs maintain DNA methylation and
acetylation to silence unimportant genes in
cancer cells.
39. How can understanding the gene expression pattern in
a cancer cell tell you something about that specific form of
cancer?
a.
Understanding gene expression patterns in
cancer cells will identify the faulty genes, which
is helpful in providing the relevant drug
treatment.
b.
Understanding gene expression will help
diagnose tumor cells for antigen therapy.
c.
Gene profiling would identify the target genes of
the cancer-causing pathogens.
d.
Breast cancer patients who do not express EGFR
can respond to anti-EGFR therapy.
40. Explain what personalized medicine is and how it can
be used to treat cancer.
a.
Personalized medicines would vary based on the
type of mutations and the gene’s expression
pattern.
b.
The medi
