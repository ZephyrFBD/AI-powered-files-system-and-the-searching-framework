electrons in a bond. In a nonpolar covalent bond, the electrons in the 
bond are shared equally by the two atoms; in a polar covalent bond, 
one of the atoms exerts a greater attraction for the electrons than the 
other.
Electronegativity is a numerical measure of the ability of an atom 
to compete with other atoms for the electrons shared between 
them. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, meaning it has 
the greatest ability to attract electrons from other atoms. Electro-
negativity values range from 0.7 for Cs to 4.0 for F. Electronegativity 
generally increases from left to right in a row of the periodic table 
and decreases going down a column. The difference in the electro-
negativities of bonded atoms can be used to determine the polarity 
of a bond. The greater the electronegativity difference, the more po-
lar the bond.
A polar molecule is one whose centers of positive and negative 
charge do not coincide. Thus, a polar molecule has a positive side 
and a negative
