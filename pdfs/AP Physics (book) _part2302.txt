 drawn such that
the number of lines per unit area is proportional to the field strength. Then the
flux 
can be thought of as being proportional to the total number of lines
passing through the area enclosed by the loop. This is illustrated in Fig. 21–4,
where three wire loops of a coil are viewed from the side (on edge). For

a weber:
With our definition of flux, Eq.21–1, we can write down the results of Faraday’s
investigations: The emf 
induced in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of
magnetic flux through the circuit:

This fundamental result is known as Faraday’s law of induction, and it is one of
the basic laws of electromagnetism.
If the circuit contains N loops that are closely wrapped so the same flux passes
through each, the emfs induced in each loop add together, so the total emf is
