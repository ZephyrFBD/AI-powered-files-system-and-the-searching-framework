ntly, 
the effective nuclear charge experienced by each 2s electron is about 4 - 2 = 2+.
Going down a column, the effective nuclear charge experienced by valence electrons changes 
far less than it does across a period. For example, using our simple estimate for S, we would 
expect the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons in lithium and 
sodium to be about the same, roughly 3 - 2 = 1+ for lithium and 11 - 10 = 1+ for 
sodium. In fact, however, effective nuclear charge increases slightly as we go down a column

Which electron has a higher probability of being found 
within 0.5 Å of the nucleus, one in a 2s orbital or one in a 
2p orbital? Which orbital, 2s or 2p, will be lower in energy 
in a multielectron atom?

1s electrons are much closer to the nucleus 
– they screen the valence electrons.
2s electrons experience greater nuclear 
attraction than the 2p electrons.
