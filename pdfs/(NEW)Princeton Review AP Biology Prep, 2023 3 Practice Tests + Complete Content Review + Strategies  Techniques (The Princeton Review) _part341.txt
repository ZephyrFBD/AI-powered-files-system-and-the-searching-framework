 sequences of RNA and mark them for destruction. This will be discussed more later in this
chapter. Now that we know about the different types of RNA, let’s see how they direct the synthesis of proteins.
Transcription
Transcription involves making an RNA copy of a bit of DNA code. The initial steps in transcription are similar to
the initial steps in DNA replication. The obvious difference is that, whereas in replication we end up with a complete
copy of the cell’s DNA, in transcription we end up with only a tiny specific section copied into an mRNA. This is
because only the bit of DNA that needs to be expressed will be transcribed. If you wanted to make a cake, but your
cookbook couldn’t leave your vault (aka the nucleus), you wouldn’t copy the entire cookbook! You would copy
only the recipe for the cake.
Since each recipe is a gene, transcription occurs as-needed on a gene-by-gene basis.
The exception to this is prokaryotes because they will transcribe a recipe that can be used to ma
