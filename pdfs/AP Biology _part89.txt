om the solution with the higher water
potential to the solution with the lower water potential.
Figure 3.12 shows a sketch of two containers. Solution A is hypertonic
to solution B.
Figure 3.12 Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions
REMEMBER
Water diffuses toward the hypertonic area.
Example 1: In Figure 3.13, the cell is in an isotonic solution. Water
diffuses in and out, but there is no net change in the size of the cell.

Understand diffusion and osmosis well enough to design an experiment to demonstrate
how they affect living cells. See Lab #4 on page 422.
Example 2: The cell in Figure 3.14 is in a hypotonic solution. The
concentration of solute in the beaker is less than the concentration of solute
in the cell. Therefore, water will flow into the cell, causing the cell to
swell or burst. If the cell is a plant cell, the cell wall will prevent the cell
from bursting. The cell will merely swel
