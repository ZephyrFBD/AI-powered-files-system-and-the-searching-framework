1–1 Simple Harmonic Motion—
Spring Oscillations
When an object vibrates or oscillates back and forth, over the same path, each
oscillation taking the same amount of time, the motion is periodic. The simplest
form of periodic motion is represented by an object oscillating on the end of a
uniform coil spring. Because many other types of oscillatory motion closely
resemble this system, we will look at it in detail. We assume that the mass of the
spring can be ignored, and that the spring is mounted horizontally, as shown in
Fig. 11–1a, so that the object of mass m slides without friction on the horizontal
surface. Any spring has a natural length at which it exerts no force on the mass m.
The position of the mass at this point is called the equilibrium position. If the mass
is moved either to the left, which compresses the spring, or to the right, which
stretches it, the spring exerts a force on the mass that acts in the direction
