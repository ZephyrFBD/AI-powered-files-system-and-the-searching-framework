y plane. The choice of this axis is arbitrary. If the object is at rest,
then
is valid about any axis. Therefore we can choose any axis that
makes our calculation easier. Once the axis is chosen, all torques must be calcu-
lated about that axis.
A lever. The bar in Fig. 9–6 is being used 
as a lever to pry up a large rock. The small rock acts as a fulcrum (pivot point).
The force 
required at the long end of the bar can be quite a bit smaller than 
the rock’s weight mg, since it is the torques that balance in the rotation about 
the fulcrum. If, however, the leverage isn’t sufficient, and the large rock isn’t
budged, what are two ways to increase the lever arm?
RESPONSE One way is to increase the lever arm of the force 
by slipping a
pipe over the end of the bar and thereby pushing with a longer lever arm.
A second way is to move the fulcrum closer to the large rock. This may change
the long lever arm R only a little, but it changes the short lever arm r by a 
substantial fraction and
