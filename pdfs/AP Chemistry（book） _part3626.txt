 the following compounds, and 
indicate the oxidation state of the group 4A element or of 
boron in each: (a) silicon dioxide, (b) germanium tetra-
chloride, (c) sodium borohydride, (d) stannous chloride, 
(e) diborane, (f) boron trichloride.
 22.71  Select the member of group 4A that best fits each descrip-

in oxidation states ranging from -4 to +4, (c) is most 
abundant in Earthâ€™s crust.
 22.72  Select the member of group 4A that best fits each descrip-
tion: (a) forms chains to the greatest extent, (b) forms the 
most basic oxide, (c) is a metalloid that can form 2+ ions.
 22.73  (a) What is the characteristic geometry about silicon in 
all silicate minerals? (b) Metasilicic acid has the empirical 
formula H2SiO3. Which of the structures shown in Figure 
22.32 would you expect metasilicic acid to have?
 22.74  Speculate as to why carbon forms carbonate rather than 
 
silicate analogs.
