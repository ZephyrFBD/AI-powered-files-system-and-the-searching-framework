in the electron transport chain, cytochrome c, is so ubiquitous among living organisms
that the approximately100-aminoacid sequence of the protein is often compared among species to assess genetic
relatedness.
Mitochondria
The two major processes of aerobic respiration, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, occur in
mitochondria. There are four distinct areas of a mitochondrion, as follows (Figure 4-4):
1. Outer membrane. This membrane, like the plasma membrane, consists of a double layer of phospholipids.
 
2. Intermembrane space. This is the narrow area between the inner and
 
outer membranes. H+ ions (protons) accumulate here.
3. Inner membrane. This second membrane, also a double phospholipid bilayer, has convolutions called cristae
(singular, crista). Oxidative phosphorylation occurs here. Within the membrane and its cristae, the electron transport
chain, consisting of a series of protein complexes,
removes electrons from NADH and FADH2 and transports H+ ions
from the mat
