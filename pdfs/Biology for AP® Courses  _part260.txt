Dehydration Synthesis
As you’ve learned, biological macromolecules are large molecules, necessary for life, that are built from smaller organic
molecules. There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids);
each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions. Combined, these molecules make up the
majority of a cell’s dry mass (recall that water makes up the majority of it
