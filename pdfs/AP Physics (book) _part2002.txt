istivity (Section 18–4) of certain
metals and certain compounds or alloys becomes zero as measured by the highest-
precision techniques. Materials in such a state are said to be superconducting.
This phenomenon was first observed by H. K. Onnes (1853–1926) in 1911 when he
cooled mercury below 4.2 K 
and found that the resistance of mercury
suddenly dropped to zero. In general, superconductors become superconducting
only below a certain transition temperature or critical temperature,
which is
usually within a few degrees of absolute zero. Current in a ring-shaped supercon-
ducting material has been observed to flow for years in the absence of a potential
difference, with no measurable decrease. Measurements show that the resistivity 
of superconductors is less than 
which is over 
times smaller
than that for copper, and is considered to be zero in practice. See Fig. 18–26.
