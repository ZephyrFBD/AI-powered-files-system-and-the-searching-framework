The comparatively low bond enthalpy of F2 1155 kJ>mol2 accounts in part for the 
extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine. Because of its high reactivity, F2 is difficult to 
work with. Certain metals, such as copper and nickel, can be used to contain F2 because 
their surfaces form a protective coating of metal fluoride. Chlorine and the heavier halo-
gens are also reactive, though less so than fluorine.
Because of their high electronegativities, the halogens tend to gain electrons from 
other substances and thereby serve as oxidizing agents. The oxidizing ability of the halo-
gens, indicated by their standard reduction potentials, decreases going down the group. 
As a result, a given halogen is able to oxidize the halide anions below it. For example, Cl2 
oxidizes Br -  and I -  but not F -, as seen in Figure 22.8.
Notice in Table 22.2 that the standard
