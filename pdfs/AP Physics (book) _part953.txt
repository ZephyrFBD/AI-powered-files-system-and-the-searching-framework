 legs, and most also have a lower center of
gravity. When walking and performing other kinds of movement, a person con-
tinually shifts the body so that its CG is over the feet, although in the normal adult
this requires no conscious thought. Even as simple a movement as bending over
requires moving the hips backward so that the CG remains over the feet, and you
do this repositioning without thinking about it. To see this, position yourself with
your heels and back to a wall and try to touch your toes. You won’t be able to do it
without falling. Persons carrying heavy loads automatically adjust their posture
so that the CG of the total mass is over their feet, Fig. 9–17.
9–5 Elasticity; Stress and Strain
In the first part of this Chapter we studied how to calculate the forces on objects
in equilibrium. In this Section we study the effects of these forces: any object
changes shape under the action of applied forces. If the forces are great enough,
the object will break, or fracture, as
