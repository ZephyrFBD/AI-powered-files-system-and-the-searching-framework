 called the primary acceptor, and then they are passed down
to carriers in the electron transport chain.
To replenish the electrons in the thylakoid, water is split into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons. That process is
called photolysis. The electrons from photolysis replace the missing electrons in photosystem II.
As the energized electrons from photosystem II travel down the electron transport chain, they pump hydrogen ions
into the thylakoid lumen. A proton gradient is established. As the hydrogen ions move back into the stroma through
ATP synthase, ATP is produced.
After the electrons leave photosystem II, they go to photosystem I. The electrons are passed through a second
electron transport chain until they reach the final electron acceptor NADP+ to make NADPH.
Photosystem I and photosystem II were numbered in order of their discovery,
not the order they are used in photosynthesis.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes.
Here is a summary of th
