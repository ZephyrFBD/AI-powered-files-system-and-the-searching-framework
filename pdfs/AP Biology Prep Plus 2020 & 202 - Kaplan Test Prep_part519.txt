ures increases the entropy, while metabolic heat loss
decreases the entropy of the environment.
(B)
To maintain its high degree of structural organization, the cell
releases energy as heat to increase entropy.
(C)
A living cell is at equilibrium with its environment, so the total
energy is conserved.
(D)
