bstance is presentâ€”and for following substances along a natural
metabolic pathway in biological organisms. For detection of a given compound, the
stimulating light must be monochromatic, and solvents or other materials present
must not fluoresce in the same region of the spectrum. Sometimes the observation
of fluorescent light being emitted is sufficient to detect a compound. In other
cases, spectrometers are used to measure the wavelengths and intensities of the
emitted light.
Fluorescent lightbulbs work in a two-step process. The applied voltage accel-
erates electrons that strike atoms of the gas in the tube and cause them to be
excited. When the excited atoms jump down to their normal levels, they emit UV 
photons which strike a fluorescent coating on the inside of the tube. The light we
see is a result of this material fluorescing in response to the UV light striking it.
Materials such as those used for luminous watch dials, and other glow-in-
the-dark products, are said to be pho
