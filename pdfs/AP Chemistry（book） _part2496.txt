 atm) contains 0.2% CO, 12% CO2, and 3% O2 
by volume, is the system at equilibrium with respect to the 
CO2 reaction? Based on your conclusion, would the CO 
concentration in the exhaust be decreased or increased by 
a catalyst that speeds up the CO2 reaction? Recall that at a 
ﬁxed pressure and temperature, volume % = mol %.
 15.94 At a temperature of 700 K, the forward and reverse rate 
constants for the reaction 2 HI1g2 ∆H21g2 + I21g2 
are kf = 1.8 * 10-3 M-1 s-1 and kr = 0.063 M-1 s-1. 
 
(a) What is the value of the equilibrium constant Kc at 
 
700 K?  (b) Is the forward reaction endothermic or exo-
thermic if the rate constants for the same reaction have 
values of kf = 0.097 M-1 s-1 and kr = 2.6 M-1 s-1 at 800 K?
 15.84 At 900 °C, Kc = 0.0108 for the reaction
CaCO31s2 ∆ CaO1s2 + CO21g2
 
 A mixture of CaCO3, CaO, and CO2 is placed in a 10.0-L 
vessel at 900 °C. For the following mixtures, will the 
amount of CaCO3 increase, decrease, or remain the same 
as the system approache
