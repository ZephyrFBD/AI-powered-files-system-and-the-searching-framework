e transpiration rates. Other plants have
vertically oriented leaves that reduce the amount of surface area exposed to the sun, thus reducing transpiration.
9. A. Air bubbles obstruct the transport of water because they interrupt the continuity of water columns held together
by the cohesive forces between water molecules. Adhesion, cohesion, and the pulling force generated by the sun
through transpiration generate tension in xylem and are responsible for the transport of water in plants.
