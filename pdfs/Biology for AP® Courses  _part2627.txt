dermal cells, increase
the surface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals.
Inside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith (Figure 23.17). Compared to stems, roots
have lots of cortex and little pith. Both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products. The cortex is between the
epidermis and the vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root.
Figure 23.17 Staining reveals different cell types in this light micrograph of a wheat (Triticum) root cross section.
Sclerenchyma cells of the exodermis and xylem cells stain red, and phloem cells stain blue. Other cell types stain
black. The stele, or vascular tissue, is the area inside endodermis (indicated by a green ring). Root hairs are visible
outside the epidermis. (credit: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
The vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root, which is called the stele (Fig
