 general functions are 
selected based on the characteristics of indexes. Moreover, our functions are either 
linear or smooth. The function we choose must largely reflect the change trend and 
the subtle difference will not cause enormous effect to our model.

Appling a multi-layer model helps us to eliminate the influence of some sensitive 
data. For instance, the influence of the unexpected second level data is 
correspondingly weakened after the treat of dynamic weighted aggregative model and 
analytic hierarchy process model, making our model is in a stable state. Indexes 
depending on time test are appropriate to describe the sustainable development. 
 
6. Strengths and Weaknesses 
6.1 Strengths 
ÔÅ¨ Simplicity. We transform the assessment of the sustainable development into a 
number ranging from 0 to 1, which is intuitive and easy to understand. In addition, 
we can distinguish the strengths from the weakness according to the 
corresponding sustainabl
