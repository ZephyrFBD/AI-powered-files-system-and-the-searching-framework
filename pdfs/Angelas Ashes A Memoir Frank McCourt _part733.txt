 are drawn. I can see the black 
 
 crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning 
 
 card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled 
 
 naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all 
 
 because of me. 
 
 I slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the 
 
 Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa’s soul. I pray to 
 
 every statue, to the stained glass windows,the Stations of the Cross. I swear 
 
  
  
 I’ll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience. 
 
 Next day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross 
 
 three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever 
 
 I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have 
 
 mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody. 
 
 On Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office 
 
 bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody
