ncepts 
pertaining to mitosis and meiosis: 
•  How many cells are in your body? How were those cells produced from a single cell 
called a zygote? How does the genetic information in one of your body cells compare 
to that found in other body cells? 
•  What are some advantages of asexual reproduction in plants? 
•  What is the importance of the fact that DNA is replicated prior to cell division? 
•  How do chromosomes move inside a cell during cell division? 
•  How is the cell cycle controlled? What would happen if the control were defective? 
■ Part 1: Modeling Mitosis 
The mitosis lab begins with a discussion section during which you ask your students 
to think about how they developed from a single-celled zygote to a 300-trillion-celled 
organism. How does the genetic information in a cell from your toe compare to the 
genetic information in a cell from your arm? 
After the students have had a sufficient time to discuss this question, ask the following 
questions: What other purpo
