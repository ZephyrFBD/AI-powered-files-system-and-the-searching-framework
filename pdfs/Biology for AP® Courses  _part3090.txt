 out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but
will still be unable to vocally identify it.

where you can model the split-brain experiments yourself.
Each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. Scientists use various
techniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or
diseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits. They also conduct animal studies
where they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes. They use a technique called transmagnetic
stimulation (TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head;
and they use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in
