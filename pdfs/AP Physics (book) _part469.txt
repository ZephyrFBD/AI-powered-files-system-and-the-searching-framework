rts this inward force on the ball. The ball
exerts an equal and opposite force on the string (Newton’s third law), and this
is the outward force your hand feels (see Fig. 5–5).
The force on the ball in Fig.5–5 is the one exerted inwardly on it by you, via the
string. To see even more convincing evidence that a “centrifugal force”does not act 
on the ball, consider what happens when you let go of the string. If a centrifugal force
were acting, the ball would fly outward, as shown in Fig. 5–6a. But it doesn’t;
the ball flies off tangentially (Fig. 5–6b), in the direction of the velocity it had 
at the moment it was released, because the inward force no longer acts. Try it 
and see!
EXERCISE B Return to Chapter-Opening Question 1, page 109, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.
Force on revolving ball (horizontal). Estimate
the force a person must exert on a string attached to a 0.150-kg ball to make the
ball revolve in a horizontal
