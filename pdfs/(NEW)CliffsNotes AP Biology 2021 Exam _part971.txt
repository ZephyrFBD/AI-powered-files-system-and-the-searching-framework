 determinants)
1 pt: Cytoplasmic determinants are substances unequally distributed among the cytoplasms of daughter cells that
influence cell differentiation.
1 pt: Asymmetrical distribution of cytoplasmic determinants results in embryonic axes.
1 pt: If a frog cell is separated from a developing embryo, the graycrescent cytoplasmic substance must be present if
the separated cell is to develop into a normal frog.
3. Embryonic induction
1 pt: Embryonic induction is the influence of one cell or group of cells over neighboring cells during development.
1 pt: Signaling molecules provide cell-to-cell communications that direct development and differentiation.
4. Apoptosis
1 pt: Apoptosis is the programmed death of cells that contributes to development.
1 pt: Webbing connecting the spaces between fingers and between toes of humans undergoes programmed cell death
(apoptosis) to form separate, unattached digits.
1 pt: Various ced genes control programmed cell death in the worm C. elegans.
