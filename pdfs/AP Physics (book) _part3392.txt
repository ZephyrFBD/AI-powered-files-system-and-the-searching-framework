rrier” shown.
Since the PE just beyond 
(region B) is greater than the energy of the
alpha particle (dashed line), the 
particle could not escape the nucleus if it were
governed by classical physics. It could escape only if there were an input of energy
equal to the height of the barrier. Nuclei decay spontaneously, however, without
any input of energy. How, then, does the 
particle get from region A to region C?
It actually passes through the barrier in a process known as quantum-mechanical
tunneling. Classically, this could not happen, because an 
particle in region B
(within the barrier) would be violating the conservation-of-energy principle.†
