the movement of protons across the 
plasma membrane.
d. 
The flow of protons back through 
membrane-bound ATP synthase by 
chemiosmosis drives the formation 
of ATP from ADP and inorganic 
phosphate. This is known as oxidative 
phosphorylation in cellular respiration, and 
photophosphorylation in photosynthesis.
e. 
In cellular respiration, decoupling oxidative 
phosphorylation from electron transport 
generates heat. This heat can be used 
by endothermic organisms to regulate 
body temperature.

ENE-1.L.1
Glycolysis is a biochemical pathway that 
releases energy in glucose to form ATP from 
ADP and inorganic phosphate, NADH from 
NAD+, and pyruvate.
