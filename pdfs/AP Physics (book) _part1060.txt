 Then the mass flow rate 
through area 
is
where
is the volume of mass 
Similarly, at point 2 (through
area 
), the flow rate is 
Since no fluid flows in or out the sides of the
tube, the flow rates through 
and 
must be equal. Thus
and
(10;4a)
This is called the equation of continuity.
If the fluid is incompressible (
doesn’t change with pressure), which is an
excellent approximation for liquids under most circumstances (and sometimes
for gases as well), then
and the equation of continuity becomes
(10;4b)
The product Av represents the volume rate of flow (volume of fluid passing a given
point per second), since 
which in SI units is 
Equation 10–4b tells us that where the cross-sectional area is large, the velocity 
is small, and where the area is small, the velocity is large. That this is reasonable
can be seen by looking at a river. A river flows slowly through a meadow where it
is broad, but speeds up to torrential speed when passing through a narrow gorge.
