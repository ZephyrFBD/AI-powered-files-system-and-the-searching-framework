ility of the silicate structure. In addition, the 
fibers can be woven into asbestos cloth, which was once used for fireproof curtains and 
other applications. However, the fibrous structure of asbestos minerals poses a health 
risk because the fibers readily penetrate soft tissues, such as the lungs, where they can 
cause diseases, including cancer. The use of asbestos as a common building material has 
therefore been discontinued.

When all four vertices of each SiO4 tetrahedron are linked to other tetrahedra, the 
structure extends in three dimensions. This linking of the tetrahedra forms quartz 1SiO22. 
Because the structure is locked together in a three-dimensional array much like diamond 
 (Section 12.7), quartz is harder than strand- or sheet-type silicates.
