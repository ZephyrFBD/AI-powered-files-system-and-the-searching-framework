c heads are on the 
membrane exterior and can interact with water inside and outside of 
the cell. The hydrophobic tails in the middle of the membrane create a 
protective barrier for the cell.
(B) 
Incorrect. Phospholipids are oriented so the hydrophilic heads are on 
the membrane exterior; however, this allows them to interact with, not 
repel, water inside and outside of the cell. The internal hydrophobic tails 
create the protective barrier.
(C) 
Incorrect. Phospholipid membrane layers are oppositely oriented, 
not identically oriented, which allows them to interact with both the 
internal and external environments while still providing a protective 
barrier.
(D) 
Incorrect. Phospholipid membrane layers are oppositely oriented, not 
identically oriented. This orientation allows them to create vacuoles that 
are able to be moved throughout a cell.
