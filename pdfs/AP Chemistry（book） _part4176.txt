page 476 Tetragonal. There are two three-dimensional lattices 
that have a square base with a third vector perpendicular to the 
base, tetragonal and cubic, but in a cubic lattice the a, b, and c lat-
tice vectors are all of the same length. page 479 Ionic solids are 
composed of ions. Oppositely-charged ions slipping past each 
other could create electrostatic repulsions, so ionic solids are brit-
tle. page 483 The packing efficiency decreases as the number of 
nearest neighbors decreases. The structures with the highest packing 
efficiency, hexagonal and cubic close packing, both have atoms with 
a coordination number of 12. Body-centered cubic packing, where 
the coordination number is 8, has a lower packing efficiency, and 
primitive cubic packing, where the coordination number is 6, has a 
lower packing efficiency still. page 484 Interstitial, because boron 
is a small nonmetal atom that can fit in the voids between the larger 
palladium atoms. page 4
