fected by a virus is called a host.
Viruses have one goal: replicate and spread. In order to do this, a virus needs to make more genome and make more
capsid. They then assemble together into new viral particles.
The viral genome carries genes for building the capsid and anything else the virus needs that the host cannot
provide. Sometimes, if two viruses infect the same cell, there will be mixing of the genomes, especially if the viruses
have genomes split between several chromosome-like segments. A new virus particle might emerge that is a blend
of the two viruses.
A commonly studied virus is a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria). Bacteriophages undergo two different
types of replication cycles, the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle. In the lytic cycle, the virus immediately starts
using the host cellâ€™s machinery to replicate the genetic material and create more capsid proteins. These
spontaneously assemble into mature viruses and cause the cell to lyse, or break open, rel
