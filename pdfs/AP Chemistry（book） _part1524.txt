The compound on the right is called cisplatin, and the com-
pound on the left is called transplatin. (a) Which compound 
has a nonzero dipole moment? (b) One of these compounds 
is an anticancer drug, and one is inactive. The anticancer 
drug works by its chloride ions undergoing a substitution 
reaction with nitrogen atoms in DNA that are close together, 
forming a N—Pt—N angle of about 90˚. Which compound 
would you predict to be the anticancer drug?

The O¬H bond lengths in the water molecule 1H2O2 are 
0.96 Å, and the H ¬O¬H angle is 104.5°. The dipole mo-
ment of the water molecule is 1.85 D. (a) In what directions 
do the bond dipoles of the O¬H bonds point? In what di-
rection does the dipole moment vector of the water mole-
cule point? (b) Calculate the magnitude o
