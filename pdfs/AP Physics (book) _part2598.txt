Can either be photographed? Discuss carefully.
6. To shoot a swimming fish with an intense light beam from
a laser gun, you should aim

23–2 Reflection; Plane Mirrors
1. (I) When you look at yourself in a 60-cm-tall plane mirror,
you see the same amount of your body whether you are
close to the mirror or far away. (Try it and see.) Use ray
diagrams to show why this should be true.
2. (I) Suppose that you want to take a photograph of yourself
as you look at your image in a mirror 3.1 m away. For what
distance should the camera lens be focused?
3. (II) Two plane mirrors meet at a 135° angle,
Fig. 23–52. If light rays strike one mirror
at 34° as shown, at what angle 
do
they leave the second mirror?

6. (II) Two plane mirrors, nearly parallel, are facing each other
2.3 m apart as in Fig.23–55. You stand 1.6 m aw
