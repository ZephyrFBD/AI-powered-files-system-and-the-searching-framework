ells do not routinely divide, such as
neurons and cardiac muscle cells). Checkpoints in the cell cycle
prevent mitosis in the event that certain events do not happen as
planned. In order to move from the synthesis phase into the second
growth phase before mitosis, DNA synthesis must be completed.
However, if DNA synthesis were blocked by a drug, chromosomes
could not be copied and the cell would remain unable to complete the
synthesis phase and progress toward mitosis, thereby preventing the
cell from dividing. Thus, (D) is correct. (A) and (B) are incorrect
because the cells would be aï¬€ected. (C) is incorrect because the cells
would not even be able to divide once, as noted above.
3. A
Learning Objective: 11.3
The cell depicted contains two pairs of chromosomes, so each of its
gametes would ordinarily contain only two chromosomes total.
Gamete 2 actually contains three chromosomes (one extra), including
two copies of the longer chromosome. When gamete 2 combines with
a standard gamete
