 be substantially lower than the
0.23% observed in my analysis.’ For healthy people under 70 it was
… 0.05 percent! This compares with the 3.4 percent claimed by the
Cult-owned World Health Organization when the hoax was ﬁrst
played and maximum fear needed to be generated. An updated
Stanford study in April, 2021, put the ‘infection’ to ‘fatality’ rate at
just 0.15 percent. Another team of scientists led by Megan O’Driscoll
and Henrik Salje studied data from 45 countries and published their
ﬁndings on the Nature website. For children and young people the
ﬁgure is so small it virtually does not register although authorities
will be hyping dangers to the young when they introduce DNA-
manipulating ‘vaccines’ for children. The O’Driscoll study produced
an average infection-fatality ﬁgure of 0.003 for children from birth to
four; 0.001 for 5 to 14; 0.003 for 15 to 19; and it was still only 0.456 up
to 64. To claim that children must be ‘vaccinated’ to protect them
from ‘Covid’ is an obviou
