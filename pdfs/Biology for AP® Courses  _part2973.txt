 lining. The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids
and monoglycerides forming tiny spheres called micelles. The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine
absorptive cells where the long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells
leaving the micelles behind in the chyme. The long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive
cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins. These large spheres are called
chylomicrons. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids and have proteins on their surface. The
surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate "heads" of phospholipids. Together, they enable the chylomicron
to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water. Chylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via
exocytosis. Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the subclavian vein.
