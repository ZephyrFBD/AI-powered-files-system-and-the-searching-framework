tilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte. When fertilized (at
conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 34.28).
The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The
outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing
of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing
a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps
that structure active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for
the support of the developing embryo. Pregnancy tests determine the level of β-HCG in urine or serum. If the hormone is
present, the test is positive.
