like a pendulum. (Usually, M is somewhat greater than m.) As a result
of the collision, the pendulum and projectile together swing up to a maximum
height h, Fig. 7–16. Determine the relationship between the initial horizontal
speed of the projectile, v, and the maximum height h.
APPROACH We can analyze the process by dividing it into two parts or two
time intervals: (1) the time interval from just before to just after the collision
itself, and (2) the subsequent time interval in which the pendulum moves from
the vertical hanging position to the maximum height h.
In part (1), Fig. 7–16a, we assume the collision time is very short, so that the
projectile is embedded in the block before the block has moved significantly from its
rest position directly below its support.Thus there is effectively no net external force,
and we can apply conservation of momentum to this completely inelastic collision.
In part (2), Fig. 7–16b, the pendulum begins to move, subject to a net 
external force (grav
