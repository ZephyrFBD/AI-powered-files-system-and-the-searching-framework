he same side of the faucet, our
assumptions no longer establish. Now the water drained away is the warm water that
exchanges heat with the hot adding water. Such kind of heat exchange is sufficient
because the overflow drain is close to the faucet. In this circumstance, more heat will
be lost. We can imagine adding hot water with the temperature of 
1
u ( 

means the heat between the cold water and the hot water that is drained away is just
the lost heat.
It is a great pity that it is almost impossible to confirm the value of

Finally, we regard 
