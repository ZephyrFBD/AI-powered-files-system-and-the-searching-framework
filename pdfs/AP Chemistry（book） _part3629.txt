 22.82  What is the anhydride for each of the following acids: 
 
(a) H2SO4, (b) HClO3, (c) HNO2, (d) H2CO3, (e) H3PO4?
 22.83  Hydrogen peroxide is capable of oxidizing (a) hydrazine to 
N2 and H2O, (b) SO2 to SO4
2 -, (c) NO2
-  to NO3
-, (d) H2S1g2 
to S(s), (e) Fe2 +  to Fe3 +. Write a balanced net ionic equation 
for each of these redox reactions.
 22.84  A sulfuric acid plant produces a considerable amount of 
heat. This heat is used to generate electricity, which helps 
reduce operating costs. The synthesis of H2SO4 consists of 
three main chemical processes: (a) oxidation of S to SO2,  
(b) oxidation of SO2 to SO3, (c) the dissolving of SO3 in 
H2SO4 and the subsequent reaction with water to form 
H2SO4. If the third process produces 130 kJ>mol, how 
much heat is produced in preparing a mole of H2SO4 from 
a mole of S? How much heat is produced in preparing 
5000 pounds of H2SO4?
