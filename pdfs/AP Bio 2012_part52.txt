imately two liters of liquid and 
nutrient waste are excreted as urine. The 
remaining fluid and dissolved substances are 
reabsorbed and continue to circulate throughout 
the body. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted 
in response to reduced plasma volume. ADH 
targets the collecting ducts in the kidney, 
stimulating the insertion of aquaporins into their 
plasma membranes and an increased reabsorption 
of water. 
  If ADH secretion is inhibited, which of the 
following would initially result? 
(A) The number of aquaporins would increase  
in response to the inhibition of ADH. 
(B) The person would decrease oral water intake 
to compensate for the inhibition of ADH. 
(C) Blood filtration would increase to 
compensate for the lack of aquaporins. 
(D) The person would produce greater amounts 
of dilute urine.
