the scent that is being followed. (credit a: modification of work by Geoff Stearns; credit b: modification of work by Cory

Introduction
Breathing is an involuntary event. How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated
by the respiratory center in the brain. Humans, when they aren’t exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per
minute on average. Canines, like the dog in Figure 30.1, have a respiratory rate of about 15–30 breaths per minute. In
addition to exhaling carbon dioxide when we breath
