udes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual’s
karyotype, cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or karyogram,
also known as an ideogram (Figure 13.5).
Figure 13.5 This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous chromosomes are the same size, and have
the same centromere positions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY chromosome pair instead of
the XX pair shown. (credit: Andreas Blozer et al)
In a given species, chromosomes can be identified by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. In a
human karyotype, autosomes or “body chromosomes” (all of the non–sex chromosomes) are generally organized in order
of size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). (The X and Y chromosomes, the 23rd pair, are not
autosomes.) However, chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. This was discovered after the naming of
