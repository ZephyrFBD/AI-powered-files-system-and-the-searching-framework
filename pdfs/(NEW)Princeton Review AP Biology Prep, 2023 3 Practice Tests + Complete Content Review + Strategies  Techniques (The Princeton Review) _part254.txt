tinue to produce ATP. Which best describes why
glycolysis is dependent on fermentation under anaerobic conditions?
(A) Glycolysis requires fermentation to produce more glucose as a substrate.
(B) Glycolysis requires fermentation to synthesize lactic acid and restore NADH to NAD+.
(C) Glycolysis requires fermentation to generate ATP molecules to complete the early steps of the pathway.
(D) Glycolysis requires fermentation to generate pyruvate for a later step in the pathway.
6. Which of the following most accurately describes the net reaction of glycolysis?
(A) It is an endergonic process because it results in a net increase in energy.
(B) It is an exergonic process because it results in a net increase in energy.
(C) It is an endergonic process because it results in a net decrease in energy.
(D) It is an exergonic process because it results in a net decrease in energy.
