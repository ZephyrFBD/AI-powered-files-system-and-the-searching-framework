5.4 The contents of the closed box in each of the following il-
lustrations represent a system, and the arrows show the 
changes to the system during some process. The lengths 
of the arrows represent the relative magnitudes of q and w. 
(a) Which of these processes is endothermic? (b) For which 
of these processes, if any, is ∆E 6 0? (c) For which process, 
if any, does the system experience a net gain in internal en-
ergy? [Section 5.2]

5.5  Imagine that you are climbing a mountain. (a) Is the 
distance you travel to the top a state function? (b) Is the 
change in elevation between your base camp and the peak 
a state function? [Section 5.2]
 
5.6  The diagram shows four states of a system, each with dif-
ferent internal energy, E. (a) Which of the states of the sys-
tem has the greatest internal energy? (b) In terms of the ∆E 
values, write two expressions for the difference in internal 
energy between State A and State B. (c) Writ
