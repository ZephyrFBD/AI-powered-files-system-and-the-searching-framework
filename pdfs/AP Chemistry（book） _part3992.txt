 of the coiled spring is opposed as the 
spring is compressed over a distance. 5.21 (a) Matter cannot leave or 
enter a closed system. (b) Neither matter nor energy can leave or enter 
an isolated system. (c) Any part of the universe not part of the sys-
tem is called the surroundings. 5.23 (a) According to the ﬁrst law of 
thermodynamics, energy is conserved. (b) The internal energy (E) of a 
system is the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies of the sys-
tem components. (c) The internal energy of a closed system increases 
when work is done on the system and when heat is transferred to the 
system. 5.25 (a) ∆E = -0.077 kJ, endothermic (b) ∆E = -22.1 kJ, 
exothermic 5.27 (a) Since no work is done by the system in case (2), 
the gas will absorb most of the energy as heat; the case (2) gas will have 
the higher temperature. (b) In case (1) energy will be used to do work 
on the surroundings 1-w2, but some will be absorbed as heat 1+  q2. 
In case (2) w = 0 and q is (+). (c) ∆E i
