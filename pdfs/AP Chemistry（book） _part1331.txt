ave no units. (d) Fluorine is the most 
electronegative element. (e) Cesium is the least electronegative 
element.
 8.38 (a) What is the trend in electronegativity going from 
left to right in a row of the periodic table? (b) How do 
 
electronegativity values generally vary going down a col-
umn in the periodic table? (c) True or false: The most easily 
 
ionizable elements are the most electronegative.

element in the group Al, Si, P; (c) the most electronegative ele-
ment in the group Ga, P
, Cl, Na; (d) the element in the group K, 
C, Zn, F that is most likely to form an ionic compound with Ba.
