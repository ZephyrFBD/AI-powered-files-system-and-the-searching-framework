Stringed Instruments
We saw in Chapter 11, Fig. 11–41, how standing waves are established on a string,
and we show this again here in Fig. 12–7. Such standing waves are the basis for all
stringed instruments. The pitch is normally determined by the lowest resonant
frequency, the fundamental, which corresponds to nodes occurring only at the
ends. The string vibrating up and down as a whole corresponds to a half wave-
length as shown at the top of Fig. 12–7; so the wavelength of the fundamental on
the string is equal to twice the length of the string. Therefore, the fundamental
frequency is
where v is the velocity of the wave on the string
(not in the air). The possible frequencies for standing waves on a stretched string
are whole-number multiples of the fundamental frequency:
(just as in Eq.
