. The animals and birds that live on those
organisms will be affected. As the algae die,
oxygen will be depleted, affecting fish and other
aquatic animals. The pH of water will change,
affecting metabolic processes as well.
b.
Non-photosynthetic organisms will not be able
to grow due to lack of light. The photosynthetic
organisms that require them to live will be
affected. As the algae die, oxygen will be
depleted, affecting fish and other aquatic
animals. The pH of water will change, affecting
metabolic processes as well.
c.
Photosynthetic organisms will not be able to
grow. The animals and birds that live on those
organisms will be affected. As the algae die,
carbon dioxide will be depleted, affecting fish
and other aquatic animals. The pH of water will
change, affecting metabolic processes as well.
