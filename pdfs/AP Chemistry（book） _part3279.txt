So we need to consider 
whether the three equations we are working 
with can be combined in a similar fashion. 
Notice that if we add the Ksp reaction to the 
standard reduction half-reaction for Fe2+, we 
get the half-reaction we want:
Reaction 3 is still a half-reaction, so we do 
see the free electrons.

If we knew ∆G° for reactions 1 and 2, we 
could add them to get ∆G° for reaction 3. 
We can relate ∆G° to E° by ∆G° = -nFE° 
(Equation 20.12) and to K by ∆G° = -RT 
ln K (Equation 19.20; see also Figure 20.13). 
Furthermore, we know that K for reaction 1 
is the Ksp of FeF2, and we know E° for  
reaction 2. Therefore, we can calculate ∆G° 
for reactions 1 and 2:
Reaction 1:
∆G° = -RT ln K = -18.314 J>K mol21298 K2 ln12.4 * 10-62 = 3.21 * 104 J>mol 
Reaction 2:
∆G° = -nFE ° = -122196,485 C>mol21-0.440 J>C2 = 8.49 * 104 J>mol
(Recall that 1 volt is 1 joule per coulomb.)
3.21 * 104 J>mol + 8.49 * 104 J>mol = 1.17 * 105 J>mol 
 
Then ∆G° for reactio
