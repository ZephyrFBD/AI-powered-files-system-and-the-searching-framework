(d)
Predict the susceptibility of the mosquitoes to the insecticides.
Accept one of the following:
• The mosquitoes will all die.
• The mosquitoes will be 100% susceptible

3.B
Provide evidence to support the scientists’ claim.
• The frequency of the phenylalanine allele increased from very low to much higher (OR: from 0.17 to 0.5) 
for population B mosquitoes that come from an area with low insecticide use. Thus insecticide use 
is not selecting for those mosquitoes with the phenylalanine allele; it is more likely that pyrethroid-
resistant mosquitoes with the phenylalanine allele are immigrating to the area, thus increasing the 
frequency of the allele in the population.
