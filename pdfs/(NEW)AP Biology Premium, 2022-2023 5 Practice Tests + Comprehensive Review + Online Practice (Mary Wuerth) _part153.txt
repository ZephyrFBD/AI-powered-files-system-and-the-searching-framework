12. If a person is in the hospital with severe dehydration, often an intravenous infusion of physiological saline
(0.9% saline) will be administered.
(a) Describe how the water potential of a person’s cells would be affected by severe dehydration.
(b) Explain why 0.9% saline is used to rehydrate a person with severe dehydration and why distilled water is
not used.
(c) During strenuous exercise under extreme heat, some athletes are advised to consume salt tablets. Predict
whether consuming a salt tablet would lead to water loss or water conservation in the athlete’s body cells.
(d) Justify your prediction from part (c) using your knowledge of water potential.
