vide necessary background for many of the laboratory experi-
ments usually performed in general chemistry. We believe that 
an early introduction to thermochemistry is desirable because 
so much of our understanding of chemical processes is based 
on considerations of energy changes. By incorporating bond 
enthalpies in the Thermochemistry chapter we aim to empha-
size the connection between the macroscopic properties of 
substances and the submicroscopic world of atoms and bonds. 
We believe we have produced an effective, balanced approach 
to teaching thermodynamics in general chemistry, as well as 
providing students with an introduction to some of the global 
issues involving energy production and consumption. It is no 
easy matter to walk the narrow pathway between—on the one 
hand—trying to teach too much at too high a level and—on 
the other hand—resorting to oversimplifications. As with the 
book as a whole, the emphasis has been on imparting conceptual 
understanding, as opp
