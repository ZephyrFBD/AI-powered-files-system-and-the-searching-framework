adiation intensity increased, but
condensed DNA was protected from this damage.
(B)
Both decondensed and recondensed DNA experienced
damage due to double strand breaks in a dose-dependent
manner.
(C)
Decondensed DNA showed no damage in even the highest
radiation treatment, suggesting that decondensation oﬀered
some type of protection from radiation damage.

2. To understand gene regulation, researchers have carefully
examined the structure and function of the lac operon in E. coli.
The lac operon contains three genes that code for proteins
associated with lactose metabolism. It also contains an operator
region that binds to a repressor and turns oﬀ the expression of all
three genes. If a mutation occurred in the operator region of the
lac operon, what would most likely happen?
Because a mutation had occurred, the operon could not work
properly and the genes would not be expressed.
(A)
Because a mutation had occurred, the proteins associated
with lactose metabolism might not work pro
