sperm cell. Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.
Stem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive
state. During adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the
production of viable sperm. This continues into old age.

Oogenesis
Oogenesis, illustrated in Figure 34.15, occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries. As with sperm production, oogenesis
starts with a germ cell, called an oogonium (plural: oogonia), but this cell undergoes mitosis to increase in number,
eventually resulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo.
