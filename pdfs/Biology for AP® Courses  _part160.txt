ive and seven orbitals, respectively. These are not shown in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has s, p, and d
subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away
from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to
the next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available
orbital.

Figure 2.8 The s subshells are shaped like spheres. Both the 1n and 2n principal shells have an s orbital, but the size
of the sphere is larger in the 2n orbital. Each sphere is a single orbital. p subshells are made up of three dumbbell-
shaped orbitals. Principal shell 2n has a p subshell, but shell 1 does not.
The closest orbital to the nucleus, called the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. This orbital is equivalent to the
innermost electron she
