Check your result by seeing if it 
works in situations where the 
answer is easily guessed
The advantage of a pulley. A mover is
trying to lift a piano (slowly) up to a second-story apartment (Fig. 4–24). He is
using a rope looped over two pulleys as shown. What force must he exert on the
rope to slowly lift the piano’s 1600-N weight?
RESPONSE The magnitude of the tension force 
within the rope is the same
at any point along the rope if we assume we can ignore its mass. First notice the
forces acting on the lower pulley at the piano. The weight of the piano
pulls down on the pulley. The tension in the rope, looped through this 
pulley, pulls up twice, once on each side of the pulley. Let us apply Newton’s
second law to the pulley–piano combination (of mass m), choosing the upward
direction as positive:
