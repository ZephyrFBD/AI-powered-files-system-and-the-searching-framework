ntemplate strand 
• 
C T in second position of the Arg codon of the non-coding/template strand 
• 
G/C  A/T mutation in second position of the Arg codon  
 
Justification (1 point) 
• 
If the substitution doesn’t cause a major disruption of structure, the function is maintained. 
• 
Conservative substitutions (amino acids having similar R-groups) are less likely to disrupt 
structure/function.

Question 4 
 
  Bacteria and fungi are found in all ecosystems on Earth. A scientist claims that fungi are keystone 
species in a particular terrestrial ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, the scientist divides an area 
within the ecosystem into multiple small plots of similar size. Equal numbers of plots are then randomly 
assigned to one of three treatment groups. Plots in the first group are sprayed with a water-soluble 
substance that selectively kills fun
