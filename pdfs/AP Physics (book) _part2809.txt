 placed just beyond the objective’s focal point
as shown in Fig. 25–24a. The image 
formed by the objective lens is real, quite
far from the objective lens, and much enlarged. The eyepiece is positioned so that
this image is near the eyepiece focal point 
The image 
is magnified by the
eyepiece into a very large virtual image,
which is seen by the eye and is
inverted. Modern microscopes use a third “tube” lens behind the objective, but
we will analyze the simpler arrangement shown in Fig. 25–24a.

The overall magnification of a microscope is the product of the magnifica-
tions produced by the two lenses. The image 
formed by the objective lens is
a factor 
greater than the object itself. From Fig. 25–24a and Eq. 23–9 for the
magnification of a simp
