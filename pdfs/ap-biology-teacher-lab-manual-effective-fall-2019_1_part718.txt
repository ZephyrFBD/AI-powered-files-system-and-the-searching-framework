Step 1 Design an experiment to investigate one of the aforementioned questions or one of 
your own questions to determine the effect of an environmental variable(s) on the rate of 
transpiration in plants. When identifying your design, be sure to address the following 
questions: 
•  What is the essential question being addressed? 
•  What assumptions are made about the questions being addressed? 
•  Can those assumptions be easily verified? 
•  Will the measurement(s) provide the necessary data to answer the question under 
study? 
•  Did you include a control in your experiment? 
Step 2 Make a hypothesis/prediction about which environmental factors will have the 
greatest effect on transpiration rates. Be sure to explain your hypothesis. 
Step 3 Conduct your experiment(s) and record data
