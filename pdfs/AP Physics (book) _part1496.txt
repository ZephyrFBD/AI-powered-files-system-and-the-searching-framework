77. An iron cube floats in a bowl of liquid mercury at 0°C.
(a) If the temperature is raised to 25°C, will the cube float
higher or lower in the mercury? (b) By what percent will
the fraction of volume submerged change? [Hint: See
Chapter 10.]

78. A helium balloon, assumed to be a perfect sphere, has a
radius of 24.0 cm. At room temperature (20°C), its internal
pressure is 1.08 atm. Determine the number of moles of
helium in the balloon, and the mass of helium needed to
inflate the balloon to these values.

open the jar, it can be placed into a bath of hot water.
After this treatment, the temperatures of t
