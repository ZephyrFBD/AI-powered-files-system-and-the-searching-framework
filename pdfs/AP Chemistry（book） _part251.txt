of sugar in a cup of coffee. How can we explain the 
striking and seemingly infinite variety of properties of 
the materials that make up our world? Both carbon 
and sodium chloride can form transparent, colorless 
crystals, but table salt (NaCl) readily dissolves in 
water while diamonds (C) do not. Aluminum conducts 
electricity, but aluminum oxide does not. Paper burns 
in the presence of oxygen gas but not in the presence 
of nitrogen gas. What accounts for these differences? 
The answers to all such questions lie in the structures 
of atoms, which determine the physical and chemical 
properties of matter.
 
2.1 ▶ The Atomic Theory of Matter Learn 
how scientists were able to postulate that 
atoms are the smallest building block of matter, 
long before they could be seen directly.
 
2.2 ▶ The Discovery of Atomic 
Structure Examine key experiments that 
led to the discovery of electrons and to the 
nuclear model of the atom.
