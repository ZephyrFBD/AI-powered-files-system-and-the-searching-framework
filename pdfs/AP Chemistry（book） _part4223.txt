Figure 12.22 The molecular orbitals become more closely spaced 
in energy. Figure 12.23 Potassium has only one valence electron 
per atom 14s12. Therefore we expect the 4s band to be approximately 
half full. If we fill the 4s band halfway a small amount of electron

nolphthalein is not sensitive to pH changes when pH 6 8, so nei-
ther changes color at pH = 7. Figure 16.12 Yes. The equilibrium 
of interest is H3CCOOH ∆ H+ + H3CCOO-. If the percent disso-
ciation remained constant as the acid concentration increased, the 
concentration of all three species would increase at the same rate. 
However, because there are two products and only one reactant, 
the product of the concentrations of products would increase faster 
than the concentration of the reactant. Because the equilibrium 
constant is constant, the percent dissociation decreases as the acid 
concentration increases. Figure 16.13 3. Figure 16.15 The
