and abiotic chemical evolution ended.
 
As a by-product of the photosynthetic activity of autotrophs, oxygen was released and accumulated in the
atmosphere. The interaction of UV light and oxygen produced the ozone layer.
As a result of the formation of the ozone layer, incoming UV light was absorbed, preventing it from reaching the
surface of the earth. Thus, the major source of energy for the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules and primitive
cells was terminated.
9. Eukaryotes formed (endosymbiotic theory).
 
Endosymbiotic theory describes how eukaryotic cells originated from a mutually beneficial association (symbiosis)
among various kinds of prokaryotes. Specifically, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles established
residence inside another prokaryote, producing a eukaryote.
There is considerable evidence for the endosymbiotic theory. A sample of that evidence follows:
1. Mitochondria and chloroplasts possess their own DNA. The DNA is circular and without histone pro
