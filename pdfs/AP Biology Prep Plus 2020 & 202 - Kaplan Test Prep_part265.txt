 such as drought tolerance or
pathogen resistance that aﬀects growth rate and performance. In
addition, some polyploids can interbreed and become a new species.
AP Biology Lab 11: Transpiration
Investigation
This investigation is another example of a controlled experiment to
evaluate the eﬀects of environmental variables on the rate of
transpiration for a plant. It is easy to complete and requires simple
equipment. The objectives are threefold: another opportunity to explore
the scientific method through controlled experimentation, a chance to
make direct observations on the phenomena immediately related to the
physical properties of water, and an occasion to observe the
environment’s eﬀects on an actual organism.
A suitable plant species is obtained and set up with a potometer, a fancy
name for a tube that measures the amount of water taken up by a plant
during transpiration. The water-filled tube is connected to the bottom of
a plant’s cut stem so that the water leaving the tube and
