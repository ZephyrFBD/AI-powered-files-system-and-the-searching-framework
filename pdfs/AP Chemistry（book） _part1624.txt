Thus, the gas initially appearing on the opposite side of the bar-
rier is very slightly enriched in 235U. The process is repeated thou-
sands of times, leading to a nearly complete separation of the two 
isotopes. Because of the large number of steps needed to adequately 
separate the isotopes, gaseous diffusion facilities are large-scale 
structures. The largest diffusion plant in the United States is located 
outside of Paducah, Kentucky. It contains approximately 400 miles 
of piping and the buildings where the separation takes place take 
up over 75 acres.
An increasingly popular method of separating uranium iso-
topes is by a technique that uses centrifuges. In this procedure, cy-
lindrical rotors containing UF6 vapor spin at high speed inside an 
evacuated casing. Molecules of 238UF6 move closer to the spinning 
walls, whereas molecules of 235UF6 remain in the middle of t
