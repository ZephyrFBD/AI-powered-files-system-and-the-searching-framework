ich a heavy nucleus 
splits to form two or more product nuclei. 
Nuclear fission is the energy source for 
nuclear power plants.
 21.8 ▶  Nuclear Power: Fusion Learn that 
in nuclear fusion two light nuclei are fused 
together to form a more stable, heavier 
nucleus.
 21.9 ▶  Radiation in the Environment 
and Living Systems Discover that 
naturally occurring radioisotopes bathe 
our planet—and us—with low levels of 
radiation. The radiation emitted in nuclear 
reactions can damage living cells but also 
has diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
WHAT’S AHEAD
◀ THE SUN IS A HUGE SPHERE so hot that nuclei and electrons move 
independently. It accounts for 99.86% of the mass of our solar system 
and is composed of 73.8% hydrogen, 24.8% helium, and 1.4% other 
elements. Most of the Sun’s energy is generated in its core by the fusion 
of hydrogen nuclei to form helium nuclei. The Sun’s surface releases 
this energy as electromagnetic radiation accompanied by a stream of 
charged particles
