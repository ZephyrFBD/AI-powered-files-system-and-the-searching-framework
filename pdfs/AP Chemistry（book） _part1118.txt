โฒ Figure 7.15 Representative oxidation states of the elements. Note that hydrogen exhibits both  
positive and negative oxidation numbers, +1 and -1.
Give It Some Thought
Arsenic forms binary compounds with Cl and with Mg. Will it be in the same 
oxidation state in these two compounds?
Compounds made up of a metal and a nonmetal tend to be ionic substances. For example, 
most metal oxides and halides are ionic solids. To illustrate, the reaction between nickel 
metal and oxygen produces nickel oxide, an ionic solid containing Ni2+ and O2 -  ions:
 
2 Ni1s2 + O21g2 ยก 2 NiO1s2 
[7.7]
The oxides are particularly important because of the great abundance o
