 The captured mass of hydrogen suddenly fuses into helium at a high
rate for a few weeks. Many novae (maybe all) are recurrent—they repeat their
bright glow years later.

FIGURE 33–9 The star indicated by
the arrow in (a) exploded in 1987 as
a supernova (SN1987A), as shown 
in (b). The bright spot in (b) indicates
a huge release of energy but does
not represent the physical size.
