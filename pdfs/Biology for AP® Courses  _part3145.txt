CHAPTER SUMMARY
26.1 Neurons and Glial Cells
The nervous system is made up of neurons and glia. Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as
well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other
neurons or tissues. There are four main types of neurons: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar neurons. Glia
are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal d
