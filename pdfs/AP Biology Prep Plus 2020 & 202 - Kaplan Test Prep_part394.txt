AP EXPERT NOTE
You do not need to memorize the diﬀerences between C3, C4, and
CAM plants for Test Day.
Plants that go through C4 photosynthesis are grasses, which include
semi-arid to arid crops like corn and sorghum. Many succulent plants,
such as cacti, use an alternative method of limiting water loss in arid
environments and are called CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) plants
because they collect CO2 at night when it is cooler. CO2 is then stored in
the form of organic acids. C3, C4, and CAM plants all carry out the dark
reactions in the Calvin cycle. However, C4 plants complete a carbon
fixation step in separate parts of the plant, and CAM plants complete a
carbon fixation step at separate times.
Photophosphorylation is driven by light energy absorbed by pigments
(such as chlorophylls) in chloroplasts. White light is composed of many
diﬀerent wavelengths. Plants in particular have developed ways to use
light of more than one wavelength. Chloroplasts can only use
