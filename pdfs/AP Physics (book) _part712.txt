er energy is produced in the collision, then 
the total kinetic energy of the two objects is the same after the collision as before.
For the brief moment during which the two objects are in contact, some (or 
all) of the energy is stored momentarily in the form of elastic potential energy.

objects (a) approach each other 
with equal speeds, (b) collide, and
then (c) bounce off with equal
speeds in the opposite directions if
the collision is elastic, or (d) bounce
back much less or not at all if the
collision is inelastic (some of the KE
is transformed to other forms of
energy such as sound and heat).
