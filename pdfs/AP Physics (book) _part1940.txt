charge
would have to be transferred between a carpet and a shoe
for there to be a 6.0-kV potential difference between the
shoe and the carpet? Approximate the area of the shoe and
assume the shoe and carpet are large sheets of charge
separated by a small distance 
92. Compact “ultracapacitors” with capacitance values up to
several thousand farads are now commercially available.
One application for ultracapacitors is in providing power for
electrical circuits when other sources (such as a battery) are
turned off. To get an idea of how much charge can be stored
in such a component, assume a 1200-F ultracapacitor is 
initially charged to 12.0 V by a battery and is then discon-
nected from the battery. If charge is then drawn off the plates
of this capacitor at a rate of 
say, to power the
backup memory of some electrical device, how long (in days)
will it take for the potential difference across this capacitor
to drop to 6.0 V?
1.0 mCs,
d = 1.0 mm.
