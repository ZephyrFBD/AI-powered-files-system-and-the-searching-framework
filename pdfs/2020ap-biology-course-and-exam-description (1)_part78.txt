he foundation for 
understanding cell biology. Students should 
explain the relationships between structure 
and function of organelles and cellular 
components on the subcellular and cellular 
levels.
Understanding biological systems frequently 
requires students to select the data 
necessary to solve a problem and use them 
to perform the appropriate calculations 
with correct units while showing their 
work and linking the results to a biological 
process. Students should gain proficiency in 
describing the characteristics of data given 
in a diagram, graph, or data table and identify 
patterns or trends in the data.
Selecting and creating the appropriate 
type of graph for a set of data are critical 
skills for communicating data that students 
should begin to master in this unit. Students 
should routinely practice analyzing different 
types of data, both hypothetical and those 
they collect, to identify patterns, connect 
variables, and perform statistical analysis.
