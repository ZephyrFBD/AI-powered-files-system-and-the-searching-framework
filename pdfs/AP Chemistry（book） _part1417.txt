2. Use the VSEPR model to determine the electron-domain geometry around the cen-
tral atom.
 
3. Specify the hybrid orbitals needed to accommodate the electron pairs based on their 
geometric arrangement (Table 9.4).
These steps are illustrated in Figure 9.19, which shows how the hybridization at N in 
NH3 is determined.
