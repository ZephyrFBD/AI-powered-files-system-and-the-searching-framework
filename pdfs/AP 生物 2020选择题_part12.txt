 
allows the body to absorb a large amount 
of excess heat energy. 
(B) The high heat of vaporization of water 
allows the body to remove excess heat 
through a phase change of water from 
liquid to gas. 
(C) The high surface tension of water 
(D) 
contributes to the physical process by 
which water leaves the body. 
The high melting temperature of water 
allows the body to remove excess heat 
through a phase change of water from 
solid to liquid. 
2. A student placed a semipermeable membrane 
inside a U-shaped channel with two chambers, 
as shown. The membrane permits the movement 
of water but not salt. The student wants to vary 
the rate of osmosis that occurs across the 
membrane. Which of the following 
experimental designs will result in the fastest net 
rate of water movement into chamber A? 
(A) Placing salt water in chamber A and 
distilled water in chamber B 
(B) Placing distilled water in both chambers 
(C) Placing distilled water in chamber A and 
salt water in chamber B
