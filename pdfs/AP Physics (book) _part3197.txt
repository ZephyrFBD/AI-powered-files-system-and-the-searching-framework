electron does not?
5. Would it ever be possible to balance a very sharp needle

6. A cold thermometer is placed in a hot bowl of soup. Will
the temperature reading of the thermometer be the same
as the temperature of the hot soup before the measurement

7. Does the uncertainty principle set a limit to how well you

8. If you knew the position of an object precisely, with no
uncertainty, how well would you know its momentum?
9. When you check the pressure in a tire, doesn’t some air
inevitably escape? Is it possible to avoid this escape of air
altogether? What is the relation to the uncertainty principle?
10. It has been said that the ground-state energy in the hydrogen
atom can be precisely known but the excited states have
some uncertainty in their values (an “energy width”). Is
