in. When the new nucleotides are joined by condensation  
reactions, two identical double-helix DNA molecules result.
(Figure 24.28). This process results in two identical double-helix DNA structures, each 
containing one strand from the original structure and one new strand. This replication 
allows genetic information to be transmitted when cells divide.
The structure of DNA is also the key to understanding protein synthesis, the means 
by which viruses infect cells, and many other problems of central importance to modern 
biology. These themes are beyond the scope of this book. If you take courses in the life 
sciences, however, you will learn a good deal about such matters.

is formed in the body from carbohydrate metabolism. In muscles, it is reduced to lactic acid in the course of exertion. The 
acid-dissociation constant for pyruvic acid is 3.
