pases break down fats. Once
digestion is complete, the lower part of the small intestine is the site of
absorption. Millions of fingerlike projections called villi absorb all the
nutrients that were previously released from digested food. Each villus
contains 
capillaries 
(that 
absorb 
amino 
acids, 
vitamins, 
and
monosaccharides), and a lacteal, a small vessel of the lymphatic system,
which absorbs fatty acids and glycerol. Each epithelial cell of the villus
has many microscopic cytoplasmic appendages called microvilli that
greatly increase the rate of nutrient absorption by the villi. Figure 15.1
shows a villus with a lacteal, capillaries, and microvilli.
STUDY TIP
High surface area-to-volume ratios enhance an organismâ€™s ability to obtain necessary
resources and eliminate waste.
