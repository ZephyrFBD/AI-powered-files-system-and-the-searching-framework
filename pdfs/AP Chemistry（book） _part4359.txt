troposphere The region of Earth’s atmosphere extending from 
the surface to about 10 km altitude. (Section 18.1)
Tyndall effect The scattering of a beam of visible light by the 
particles in a colloidal dispersion. (Section 13.6)
uncertainty principle A principle stating there is an inherent 
uncertainty in the precision with which we can simultaneously 
specify the position and momentum of a particle. This 
uncertainty is significant only for particles of extremely small 
mass, such as electrons. (Section 6.4)
unimolecular reaction An elementary reaction that involves a 
single molecule. (Section 14.6)
unit cell The smallest portion of a crystal that reproduces 
the structure of the entire crystal when repeated in different 
directions in space. It is the repeating unit or building block of 
the crystal lattice. (Section 12.2)
unsaturated solution A solution containing less solute than a 
saturated solution. (Section 13.2)
