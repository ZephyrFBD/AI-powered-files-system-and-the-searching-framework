ld steadily increase as the number of 
valence electrons increases, resulting in a corresponding increase in the melting points. 
However, elements near the middle of the transition metal series, rather than those at 
the end, have the highest melting points in their respective periods (Figure 12.21). This 
trend implies that the strength of metallic bonding first increases with increasing num-
ber of electrons and then decreases. Similar trends are seen in other physical properties of 
the metals, such as the boiling point, heat of fusion, and hardness.
To obtain a more accurate picture of the bonding in metals, we must turn to molec-
ular orbital theory. In Sections 9.7 and 9.8, we learned how molecular orbitals are created 
from the overlap of atomic orbitals. Letâ€™s briefly review some of the rules of molecular 
orbital theory:
1. Atomic orbitals combine to make molecular orbitals that can extend over the entire 
molecule.
2. A molecular orbital can contain zero, one, or two electro
