It is often important to know whether two waves with the same period (modeled by sine 
curves) are in phase or out of phase. For the curves

the phase difference between y1 and y2 is b − c. If the phase difference is a multiple of 
2, the waves are in phase; otherwise, the waves are out of phase. If two sine curves are 
in phase, then their graphs coincide.
