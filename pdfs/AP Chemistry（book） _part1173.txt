next highest-energy level. Light is produced when the 
excited electron drops back to the lower level. Which 
two energy levels are involved in this process for the Na 
atom? [Section 7.7]
 
7.7  Which of the following charts below shows the general 
periodic trends for each of the following properties of the 
main-group elements (you can neglect small deviations 
going either across a row or down a column of the periodic 
table)? (1) Bonding atomic radius, (2) ﬁrst ionization energy, 
 
(3) effective nuclear charge. [Sections 7.2–7.6]

7.8  An element X reacts with F21g2 to form the molecular prod-
uct shown here. (a) Write a balanced equation for this reac-
tion (do not worry about the phases for X and the product). 
(b) Do you think that X is a metal or nonmetal? [Sec
