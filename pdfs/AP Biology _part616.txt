Water potential (Ψ or psi) is measured in megapascals (MPa) by plant
biologists. By definition, Ψ of pure water in an open container under
standard conditions of temperature (273 K or 0°C) and pressure (1
atmosphere) is 0 (zero) MPa. Water potential (Ψ) results from solute
potential (Ψs) plus pressure potential (Ψp): Ψ = Ψs + Ψp.
Solute Potential (Ψs)
Is the osmotic potential.
Is directly proportional to molarity.
The Ψs of pure water is 0 (zero).
The Ψs is always a negative value; as the solute concentration
increases, the Ψs decreases (for example, a 0.1 M solution of sugar
has a Ψs of –0.23 MPa).
Pressure Potential (Ψp)
Is the physical pressure on a solution.
Can have a positive or negative value relative to atmospheric
pressure.
The water in living cells is usually under positive pressure due to
the uptake of water by osmosis (i.e., turgor pressure in plants); the
cell contents are pressed up against the cell wall.
The water in xylem vessels in plants (which tra
