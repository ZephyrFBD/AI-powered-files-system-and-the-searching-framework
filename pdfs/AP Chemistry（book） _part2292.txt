units of mol>L. What effect would this have had on the calculated value of k?
(d) The pressure of formic acid vapor at the start of the reaction is 3.00 * 102 torr. Assuming constant temperature and 
ideal-gas behavior, what is the pressure in the system at the end of the reaction? If the volume of the reaction chamber is 
436 cm3, how many moles of gas occupy the reaction chamber at the end of the reaction?
(e) The standard heat of formation of formic acid vapor is ∆Hf° = -378.6 kJ>mol. Calculate ∆H° for the overall reaction. If 
the activation energy 1Ea2 for the reaction is 184 kJ>mol, sketch an approximate energy profile for the reaction, and label 
Ea, ∆H °, and the transition state.

SOLUTION
(a) The initial pressure of HCOOH is 3.00 * 102 torr. On the graph 
we move to the level at which the partial pressure of HCOOH 
is 1.50 * 102 torr, half the initial value. This corresponds to a 
time of about 6.60 * 102 s, which is theref
