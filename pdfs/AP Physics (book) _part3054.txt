As we saw in Chapter 8 angular momentum is given by
where I is the moment of inertia and 
is the angular velocity. For a
single particle of mass m moving in a circle of radius r with speed v,
and
hence,
Bohr’s quantum condition is
(27;11)
where n is an integer and 
is the radius of the nth possible orbit. The allowed
orbits are numbered 
according to the value of n, which is called the
principal quantum number of the orbit.
Equation 27–11 did not have a firm theoretical foundation. Bohr had searched
for some “quantum condition,” and such tries as 
(where E represents
the energy of the electron in an orbit) did not give results in accord with experi-
ment. Bohr’s reason for using Eq. 27–11 was simply that it worked; and we now
look at how. In particular, let us determine what the Bohr theory predicts for the
measurable wavelengths of emitted light.
