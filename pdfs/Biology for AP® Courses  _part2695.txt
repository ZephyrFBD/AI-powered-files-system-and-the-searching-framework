and harvesting according to the season. Now, horticulturists can manipulate plants to increase leaf, flower,
or fruit production by understanding how environmental factors affect plant growth and development.
Greenhouse management is an essential component of a horticulturistâ€™s education. To lengthen the night,
plants are covered with a blackout shade cloth. Long-day plants are irradiated with red light in winter to
promote early flowering. For example, fluorescent (cool white) light high in blue wavelengths encourages
leafy growth and is excellent for starting seedlings. Incandescent lamps (standard light bulbs) are rich in
red light, and promote flowering in some plants. The timing of fruit ripening can be increased or delayed
by applying plant hormones. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the development of plant
breeds that are suited to different climates and resistant to pests and transportation damage. Both crop
yield and quality have increased as a result of prac
