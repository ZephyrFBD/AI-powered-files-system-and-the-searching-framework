n the genetic makeup of a population over time, with natural 
selection as its major driving mechanism. Darwin’s theory, which is supported 
by evidence from many scientific disciplines, states that inheritable variations 
occur in individuals in a population. Due to competition for limited resources, 
individuals with more favorable genetic variations are more likely to survive 
and produce more offspring, thus passing traits to future generations. A 
diverse gene pool is vital for the survival of species because environmental 
conditions change. The process of evolution explains the diversity and unity 
of life, but an explanation about the origin of life is less clear.
In addition to the process of natural selection, naturally occurring 
catastrophic and human-induced events as well as random environmental 
changes can result in alteration in the gene pools of populations. 
Scientific evidence supports that speciation and extinction have occurred 
throughout Earth’s history and that
