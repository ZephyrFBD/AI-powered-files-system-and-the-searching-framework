51. Gel electrophoresis of polymers and polymer
fragments is an important element in many investigations.
Samples of a solution are pipetted into the wells of a gel.
The gel is placed in a solution that maintains a constant
pH, and an electric field is applied over the length of the
gel. Separated components are transferred to a substrate
where they can be visualized and identified by comparison
with samples of standards. Application of this method to
DNA is called a Southern blot, named for the inventor of
the technology. The methodâ€™s application to RNA is called
a northern blot, another demonstration that biologist have
fun (there are also western, eastern, and far-eastern blots,
but these techniques are not named for their inventors).
A. Consider the three amino acids shown below and
explain how, when pipetted into a gel and subjected to an
electric field, the amino acids move; how the amino acids
are separated as they move; and which amino acid moves
furthest.
