nt aspects of the work that scientists engage in, at the level of competence expected of AP Biology 
students. These practices are effectively integrated with the course content and can be paired with a variety of 
learning objectives. You are strongly encouraged to design instruction with these science practices in mind.
Science Practice 1: Explain biological concepts, processes, and 
models presented in written format.
The ability to use verbal and/or written explanations 
that describe biological processes is an important 
learning outcome of the AP Biology course and will 
help students learn to construct and support their 
arguments. It is important to make clear the distinction 
between memorizing details and demonstrating an 
integrated understanding of how a concept or process 
relates to the overall function of the biological system. 
Students should have a deep enough understanding of 
the processes to predict the effects of environmental 
changes on those processes and justi
