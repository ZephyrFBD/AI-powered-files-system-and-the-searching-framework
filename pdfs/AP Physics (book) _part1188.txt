spring
or Slinky by alternately compressing and expanding one end. This is shown in
Fig. 11–25b, and can be compared to the transverse wave in Fig. 11–25a. A series
of compressions and expansions travel along the spring. The compressions are
those areas where the coils are momentarily close together. Expansions (sometimes
called rarefactions) are regions where the coils are momentarily far apart. Compres-
sions and expansions correspond to the crests and troughs of a transverse wave.

(a) Transverse wave;
(b) longitudinal wave.
An important example of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave in air. A vibrat-
ing drumhead, for instance, alternately compresses and expands the air in contact
with it, producing a longitudinal wave that travels outward in the air, as shown in
Fig. 11–26.
As in the case of transverse waves, each section of the medium in which a
longitudinal wave passes o
