molecules. These two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing energy—are referred to
as anabolic (building) and catabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively. Consequently, metabolism is composed of
building (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism).
Figure 6.4 This tree shows the evolution of the various branches of life. The vertical dimension is time. Early life
forms, in blue, used anaerobic metabolism to obtain energy from their surroundings.
Evolution of Metabolic Pathways
There is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways alone. Metabolic
complexity varies from organism to organism. Photosynthesis is the primary pathway in which
photosynthetic organisms like plants (the majority of global synthesis is done by planktonic algae) harvest
the sun’s energy and convert it into
