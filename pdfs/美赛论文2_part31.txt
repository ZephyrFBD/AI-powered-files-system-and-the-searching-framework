 time f2 
   Delivery time refers to the period from the beginning of delivery order to the end 
of delivering. 
The total delivery time depends on the reserve of treatment center and epidemic 
areas and whether each epidemic area demands vaccine and drugs, so: 
T1j = {
t1j   ,
x1j = 1
0  ,             x1j = 0                                     (3) 
T2ij = {t2ij   ,
x2ij = 1
0  ,             x2ij = 0                                  (4) 
  Function (3) means the delivery time of delivering vaccine and drugs from 
treatment center to epidemic area Aj (j=1,2, …, 14) 
  Function (4) means the delivery time of delivering vaccine and drugs between 
epidemic areas Ai and Aj ( i, j=1,2, …, 14, i≠j) 
  So, the objective function is as follows: 
minf1 = ∑TC1j
n
j=1
+ ∑∑TC2ij
n
j=1
n
i=1
                      (5)
