H when small amounts of strong 
acid or strong base are added to them are called buffered solutions (or merely buf-
fers). Human blood, for example, is a complex buffered solution that maintains the 
blood pH at about 7.4 (The Chemistry and Life box, “Blood as a Buffered Solution” 
later in this section). Much of the chemical behavior of seawater is determined by its 
pH, buffered at about 8.1 to 8.3 near the surface due to the HCO3
->CO3 
2- acid-base 
pair. Buffers find many important applications in the laboratory and in medicine 
(Figure 17.1). Many biological reactions occur at the optimal rates only when properly 
buffered. If you ever work in a biochemistry lab, you will very likely have to prepare 
specific buffers in which to run your biochemical reactions.
Composition and Action of Buffers
A buffer resists changes in pH because it contains both an acid to neutralize added 
OH- ions and a base to neutralize added H+ ions. The acid and base that make up the 
buffer, however, mu
