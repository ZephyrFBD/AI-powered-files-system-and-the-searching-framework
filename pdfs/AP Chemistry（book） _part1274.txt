nese(VII) oxide, Mn2O7, is a green liquid that freezes at 5.9 °C, an indication that covalent 
rather than ionic bonding dominates. The change in the oxidation state of manganese is 
responsible for the change in bonding. In general, as the oxidation state of a metal increases, 
so does the degree of covalent bonding. When the oxidation state of the metal is highly pos-
itive (roughly speaking, +4 or larger), we can expect significant covalency in the bonds it 
forms with nonmetals. Thus, metals in high oxidation states form molecular substances, such 
as Mn2O7, or polyatomic ions, such as MnO4
- and CrO4 
2 -, rather than ionic compounds.

Sample Exercise 8.7
Lewis Structure with a Multiple Bond
Draw the Lewis structure for HCN.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Draw the Lewis structure(s) for the molecule with the chemical 
formula C2H3N, where the N is connected to only one other 
atom. How many double bonds are there in the correct Lewi
