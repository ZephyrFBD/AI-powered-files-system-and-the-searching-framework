Introduction
A human, as well as every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote. Trillions
of cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. In other words,
that original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the body. Once a being is fully grown, cell reproduction is
still necessary to repair or regenerate tissues. For example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced. All
multicellular organisms use cell division for growth, maintenance, and repa
