to change freely from
one type to the other—and the three forces are different aspects of a single
underlying force. The unity is predicted to occur, however, only on a scale of less
than about 
, corresponding to a typical particle energy of about 1016 GeV.

If two elementary particles (leptons or quarks) approach each other to within 
this unification scale, the apparently fundamental distinction between them would
not exist at this level, and a quark could readily change to a lepton, or vice versa.
Baryon and lepton numbers would not be conserved. The weak, electromagnetic,
and strong (color) force would blend to a force of a single strength.
What happens between the unification distance of 
and more normal
(larger) distances is referred to as symmetry breaking. As an analogy, consider an
atom in a crystal. Deep within the atom, there is much symmetry—in the
innermost regions the electron cloud is spherically symmetric (Chapter 28).
Farther out, this symmetry breaks down—the
