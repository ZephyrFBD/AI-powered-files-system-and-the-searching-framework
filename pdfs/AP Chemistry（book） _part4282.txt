rbons Ozone-damaging substances, principally 
CFCl3 and CF2Cl2, that were once widely used as propellants in 
spray cans. They do not occur in nature. (Section 18.3)
chlorophyll A plant pigment that plays a major role 
in conversion of solar energy to chemical energy in 
photosynthesis. (Section 23.3)
cholesteric liquid crystal A liquid crystal having molecules 
arranged in layers, with their long axes parallel to the other 
molecules within the same layer. Moving from one layer to the 
next, the orientation of the molecules rotates by a fixed angle, 
resulting in a spiral pattern. (Section 11.7)
coal A naturally occurring solid containing hydrocarbons of 
high molecular weight, as well as compounds containing sulfur, 
oxygen, and nitrogen. (Section 5.8)
colligative property A property of a solvent (vapor-pressure 
lowering, freezing-point lowering, boiling-point elevation, 
osmotic pressure) that depends on the total concentration of 
solute particles present. (Section 13.5)
