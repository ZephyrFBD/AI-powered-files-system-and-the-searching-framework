Where does scientific knowledge come from? How is it acquired? 
How do we know it is reliable? How do scientists add to it, or 
modify it?
There is nothing mysterious about how scientists work. The 
first idea to keep in mind is that scientific knowledge is gained 
through observations of the natural world. A principal aim of 
the scientist is to organize these observations by identifying 
patterns and regularity, making measurements, and associating 
one set of observations with another. The next step is to ask why 
nature behaves in the manner we observe. To answer this question, 
the scientist constructs a model, known as a hypothesis, to explain 
the observations. Initially, the hypothesis is likely to be pretty ten-
tative. There could be more than one reasonable hypothesis. If a 
hypothesis is correct, then certain results and observations should 
follow from it. In this way,
