sure of 1 atm, 
would react spontaneously in the forward direction to form 
more PCl3. Remember, however, that the value of ∆G° tells us 
nothing about the rate at which the reaction occurs.
(b) When we reverse the reaction, we reverse the roles of the 
reactants and products. Thus, reversing the reaction changes 
the sign of ∆G in Equation 19.14, just as reversing the reaction 
changes the sign of ∆H. 
 (Section 5.4) Hence, using the 
result from part (a), we have
4 PCl31g2 ¡ P41g2 + 6 Cl21g2 ∆G° = +1102.8 kJ
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
The following chemical equations describe the same chemi-
cal reaction. How do the free energies of these two chemical 
equations compare?
(1) 2 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 H21g2 + O21g2
(2) H2O1l2 ¡ H21g2 + 1>2 O21g2 
(a) ∆G°
1 = ∆G°
2 (b) ∆G°
1 = 2 ∆G°
2 (c) 2 ∆G°
1 = ∆G°
2
(d) None of the above
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Use data from Appendix C to calculate ∆G° at 298 K for the 
combustion of methane:
CH41g2 + 2 O21g2 ¡ CO21g2 + 2 H2O1g2
In Section 5.7 we used Hess’s law to
