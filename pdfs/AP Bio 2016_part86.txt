ies of cactus, the number of spines on a
plant is genetically determined. The graph above
shows frequency distributions for populations of
the cactus species growing in the presence or
absence of two herbivores: peccaries (a New
World pig) and wasp larvae. Which of the
following best accounts for the different
frequency distributions in the graph?
(A) Peccaries eat cacti with the greatest number
of spines, and wasp larvae show no 
preference with respect to spine number. 
(B) Peccaries eat cacti with a smaller number of 
spines, and wasp larvae eat cacti with a 
greater number of spines. 
(C) Wasps have increasing difficulty depositing 
eggs on cacti with more spines, and 
peccaries show no preference with respect 
to spine number. 
(D) Both peccaries and wasp larvae will eat the 
most abundant types of cacti, which are the 
plants with the greatest number of spines.
