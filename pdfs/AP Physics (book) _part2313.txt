changes during the time interval 
Faraday’s law then gives the
induced emf and Ohm’s law gives the current.
SOLUTION (a) The coil’s area is 
The flux through one loop is initially 
After 0.100 s, the flux is zero. The rate of change in flux is con-
stant (because the coil is square), and for one loop is equal to
(b) The emf induced (Eq. 21–2) in the 100-loop coil during this 0.100-s interval
is
The current is found by applying Ohm’s law to the 
coil:
By Lenz’s law, the current must be clockwise to produce more 
into the page
and thus oppose the decreasing flux into the page.
(c) The total energy dissipated in the coil is the product of the power 
and the time:
(d) We can use the result of part (c) and apply the work-energy principle: the
energy dissipated E is equal to the work W needed to pull the coil out of the
field (Chapter 6). Because

Alternate Solution (d) We can also calculate the force directly using Eq. 20–2
for constant 
The force the magnetic field exerts on the
