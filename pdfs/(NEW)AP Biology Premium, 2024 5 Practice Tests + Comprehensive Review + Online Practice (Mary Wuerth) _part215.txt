hosphorylation
Oxidative phosphorylation involves the electron transport chain (ETC) and chemiosmosis, both of which occur
on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Oxidative phosphorylation yields the vast majority of ATP in cellular
respiration.
The electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) that were generated during glycolysis, the oxidation of pyruvate, and
the Krebs cycle bring their electrons to the electron transport chain on the inner mitochondrial membrane. (See
Figure 9.4.) As these electron carriers deliver their hydrogen atoms and electrons to the ETC, NADH and FADH2
are oxidized to NAD+ and FAD+, respectively. NAD+ and FAD+ can then be reused in the earlier processes of
cellular respiration.
As the electrons travel through the electron transport chain, their potential energy decreases, and energy is
released. This energy is used to pump protons (H+) out of the matrix and into the intermembrane space of the
mitochondria, creating a proton gradient. The concentration of protons in
