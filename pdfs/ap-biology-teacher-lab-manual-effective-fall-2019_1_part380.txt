such as insects or earthworms? 
•  What problems would arise if students used a living, green plant instead of 
germinating seeds? 
In Designing and Conducting Your Investigation, students design and conduct an 
experiment(s) to investigate one or more questions that they raised in Procedures. Their 
exploration will likely generate even more questions about cellular respiration. 
The lab also provides an opportunity for students to apply, review, and/or scaffold 
concepts that they have studied previously, including the relationship between cell 
structure and function (mitochondria); enzymatic activity; strategies for capture, storage, 
and use of free energy; diffusion of gases across cell membranes; and the physical laws 
pertaining to the properties and behaviors of gases.
