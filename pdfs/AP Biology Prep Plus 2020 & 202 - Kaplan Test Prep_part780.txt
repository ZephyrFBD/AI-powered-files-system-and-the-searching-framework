well as native species).
Communication
In response to stimuli, signals are transmitted and received to exchange
information. Individuals can then act on the information and
communicate it to others (individuals of the same or diï¬€erent species).
Communication among organisms produces changes in behavior that are
vital to reproductive success, natural selection, and evolution.
Signals to improve survival may stem from environmental cues like
temperature and oxygen levels. Hibernation is regulated by temperature,
level of food supply, and/or photoperiod (length of day). When it gets
cold or when the food supply gets low, animals get ready to hibernate to
save energy. Likewise, animals estivate, or slow their activity in response
to high temperatures and arid conditions, to save energy.
Organisms communicate using visual, audible, tactile, electrical, and
chemical (pheromone) signals. These signals may be used to locate
resources, show dominance, defend territory
