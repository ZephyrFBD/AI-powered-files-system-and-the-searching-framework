 limits its
size and shape. Animalsâ€™ bodies are also designed to interact with their environments, whether in the deep sea, a rainforest
canopy, or the desert. Therefore, a large amount of information about the structure of an organism's body (anatomy) and the
function of its cells, tissues and organs (physiology) can be learned by studying that organism's environment.
Body Plans
Figure 24.2 Animals exhibit different types of body symmetry. The sponge is asymmetrical, the sea anemone has
radial symmetry, and the goat has bilateral symmetry.
Animal body plans follow set patterns related to symmetry. They are asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral in form as illustrated
in Figure 24.2. Asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry; an example of an asymmetrical animal is
a sponge. Radial symmetry, as illustrated in Figure 24.2, describes when an animal has an up-and-down orientation: any
plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves, but not
