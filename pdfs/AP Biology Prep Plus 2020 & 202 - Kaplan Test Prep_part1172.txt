id, thus (C) is wrong. Finally, while it’s correct that ampicillin-
resistance has no eﬀect on insulin production via induction of the lac
operon, ampicillin-resistance is needed to isolate transformed colonies so
that insulin can be produced, thus (D) is also incorrect.

Alleles linked to phenotypes that are reproductively successful will
increase in frequency, while those that are linked to phenotypes that are
not reproductively successful will decrease. Directional selection will
increase the phenotype that is reproductively successful, which would
include those that are resistant to DFTD. The frequency of the allele for
resistance to DFTD will also increase. Therefore, (D) is incorrect and (C) is
correct. Stabilizing selection maintains the average phenotype over long
periods of time, eliminating the extremes in phenotypes. Since there are
few resistant DFTD devils, stabilizing selection would not increase the
frequency of the allele for DFTD resistance; thus (A) is incorrect.
