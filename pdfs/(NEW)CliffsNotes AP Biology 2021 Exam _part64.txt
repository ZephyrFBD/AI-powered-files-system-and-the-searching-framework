electrons. Some vitamins are coenzymes or components of coenzymes.
Inorganic cofactors are often metal ions, like Fe2+ and Mg2+.
4. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a common source of activation energy for metabolic reactions (Figure 2-13).
ATP is essentially an RNA adenine nucleotide with two additional phosphate groups. When ATP releases its energy,
a hydrolysis reaction breaks the last phosphate bond of the ATP molecule to form ADP (adenosine di phosphate)
and an inorganic phosphate group (Pi), like this:
ATP + H2O â†’ ADP + Pi + energy
In the reverse dehydration reaction, new ATP molecules are assembled by phosphorylation when ADP combines
with a phosphate group using energy obtained from some energy-rich molecule (like glucose).

off? One way of regul
