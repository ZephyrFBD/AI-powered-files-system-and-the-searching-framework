for all other species 
in the equilibrium-constant expression.
 
4. Use initial concentrations from step 1 and changes in concentration from step 3 to 
calculate any equilibrium concentrations not tabulated in step 1.
 
5. Determine the value of the equilibrium constant.
The best way to illustrate this procedure is by example, as we do in Sample Exercise 15.8.
After a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen gases in a reaction vessel is allowed to attain equilibrium at 472 °C, it is found to 
contain 7.38 atm H2, 2.46 atm N2, and 0.166 atm NH3. From these data, calculate the equilibrium constant Kp for the reaction
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ∆ 2 NH31g2
Sample Exercise 15.7
 Calculating K When All Equilibrium Concentrations Are Known
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a balanced equation and equilibrium partial 
pressures and are asked to calculate the value of the equilibrium 
constant.
Plan Using the balanced equation, we write the equilibrium- 
constant expression. We then substitute the equilibrium partia
