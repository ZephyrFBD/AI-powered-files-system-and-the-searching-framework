Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in a species. Explain how chromosomal crossover
contributes to genetic diversity.
a.
Chromosomal crossover is a specific, non-random process during which chromosomes are linked together
and exchange DNA, contributing to the genetic diversity.
b.
Chromosomal crossover occurs during meiosis when chromosome pairs are linked and exchange DNA.
Thus, crossover increases the variance of genetic combinations in the haploid gamete cell.
c.
Chromosomal crossover results in the inheritance of genetic material by offspring and the recombination
event is not variable in frequency or location.
d.
Chromosomal crossover occurs during the mitotic process when chromosomes are linked together and
recombination takes place, increasing the variance of
