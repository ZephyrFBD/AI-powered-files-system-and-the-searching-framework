onment. Today, most plants live on land.
They have diversified into almost 300,000 different species inhabiting all
but the harshest environments. Plants stabilize the soil they live in and
provide a home for billions of insects and larger animals. They release
oxygen into the atmosphere and absorb carbon dioxide. Most of the world
depends on rice, beans, soy, corn, and wheat for survival.

STRATEGIES THAT ENABLED PLANTS TO MOVE TO
LAND
Plants began life in the seas and moved to land as competition for
resources increased. The biggest problems a plant on land faces are
supporting the plant body and absorbing and conserving water. Here are
some modifications that evolved that enable plants to live on land:
Cell walls made of cellulose lend support to the plant whose cells,
unsupported by a watery environment, must maintain their own
shape.
Roots and root hairs absorb water an
