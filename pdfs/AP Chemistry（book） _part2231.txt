How is this experimentally observed temperature effect reflected 
in the rate law? The faster rate at higher temperature is due to an 
increase in the rate constant with increasing temperature. For example, 
let’s reconsider the first-order reaction we saw in Figure 14.6 namely, 
CH3NC ¡ CH3CN. Figure 14.13 shows the rate constant for this reac-
tion as a function of temperature. The rate constant and, hence, the 
rate of the reaction increase rapidly with temperature, approximately 
doubling for each 10 °C rise.
The Collision Model
Reaction rates are affected both by reactant concentrations and 
by temperature. The collision model, based on the kinetic- 
molecular theory 
 (Section 10.7), accounts for both of these effects 
at the molecular level. The central idea of the collision model is that 
molecules must collide to react. The greater the number of collisions 
per second, the greater the reaction rate. As reactant concentration 
increases, therefore, the number of collisions inc
