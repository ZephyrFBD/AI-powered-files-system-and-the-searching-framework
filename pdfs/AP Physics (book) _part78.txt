because they are not significant. As a rough general rule we can say that 
the final result of a multiplication or division should have no more digits than
the numerical value with the fewest significant figures.
In our example, 6.8 cm has the least number of significant figures, namely two. Thus
the result 
needs to be rounded off to 
EXERCISE A The area of a rectangle 4.5 cm by 3.25 cm is correctly given by (a)
(b) 
(c) 
(d)
When adding or subtracting numbers, the final result should contain no more
decimal places than the number with the fewest decimal places. For example, the
result of subtracting 0.57 from 3.6 is 3.0 (not 3.03). Similarly
not 44.2.
Be careful not to confuse significant figures with the number of decimal places.
EXERCISE B For each of the following numbers, state the number of significant
figures and the number of decimal places: (a) 1.23; (b) 0.123; (c) 0.0123.
Keep in mind when you use a calculator that all the digits it produces may
not be significant. When yo
