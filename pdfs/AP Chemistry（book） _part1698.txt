ature and 
intermolecular forces play critical roles 
in determining the physical state of a 
substance.
 11.2  ▶ Intermolecular Forces Examine the 
four intermolecular forces: dispersion forces, 
dipole–dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, 
and ion–dipole forces.
 11.3  ▶ Select Properties of Liquids Learn 
how the viscosity and surface tension of 
liquids is governed by intermolecular forces.
 11.4  ▶ Phase Changes Explore phase 
changes—the transitions of matter between 
the gaseous, liquid, and solid states—and 
their associated energies.
 11.5  ▶ Vapor Pressure Realize that a dynamic 
equilibrium exists between the liquid state 
of a substance and its gaseous state, giving 
rise to vapor pressure that can be measured.
 11.6  ▶ Phase Diagrams Learn how to 
read phase diagrams, which are graphic 
representations of the equilibria among the 
gas, liquid, and solid phases.
 11.7  ▶ Liquid Crystals Marvel at a phase 
intermediate between liquid and solid:  
the liquid crystalline phase
