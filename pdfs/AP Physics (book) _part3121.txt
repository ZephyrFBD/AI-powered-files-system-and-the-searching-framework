ht and for electrons.
Consider two slits whose size and separation are on the order of the wave-
length of whatever we direct at them, either light or electrons, Fig. 28–3. We
know very well what would happen in this case for light, since this is just Young’s
double-slit experiment (Section 24–3): an interference pattern would be seen 
on the screen behind. If light were replaced by electrons with wavelength
comparable to the slit size, they too would produce an interference pattern
(recall Fig. 27–12). In the case of light, the pattern would be visible to the eye or
could be recorded on film, semiconductor sensor, or screen. For electrons, a fluores-
cent screen could be used (it glows where an electron strikes).
