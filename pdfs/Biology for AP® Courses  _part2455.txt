ment; the cytoplasm, a
jelly-like substance inside the cell; nucleic acids, the genetic material of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis

Figure 22.9 Prokaryotes fall into three basic categories based on their shape, visualized here using scanning electron
microscopy: (a) cocci, or spherical (a pair is shown); (b) bacilli, or rod-shaped; and (c) spirilli, or spiral-shaped. (credit
