ng for the energy 
coming in and going out through different members of the community. Keeping 
track of money is relatively straightforward — you count it. You count how much 
money is coming in and how much is going to various expenses and savings.  
How do you keep track of energy in living organisms? It is a challenge. Producers 
capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy stored in energy-rich 
molecules. These molecules have mass, so the energy in biological systems can be 
indirectly measured by mass — biomass. With your lab team, take a moment to 
brainstorm how you can account for energy use and, in a biological community, 
transfer it in a manner similar to the ways in which people account for money.
