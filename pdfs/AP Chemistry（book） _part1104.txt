Referring to the periodic table, arrange the atoms Ne, Na, P, Ar, K in order of increasing first ionization energy.
Sample Exercise 7.6 
Periodic Trends in Ionization Energy
SOLUTION
Analyze and Plan We are given the chemical symbols for five ele-
ments. To rank them according to increasing first ionization en-
ergy, we need to locate each element in the periodic table. We can 
then use their relative positions and the trends in first ionization 
energies to predict their order.
Solve Ionization energy increases as we move left to right across 
a  
period and decreases as we move down a group. Because Na, P
, 
and Ar are in the same period, we expect I1 to vary in the order 
Na 6 P 6 Ar. Because Ne is above Ar in group 8A, we expect 
Ar 6 Ne. Similarly, K is directly below Na in group 1A, and so we 
expect K 6 Na.
From these observations, we conclude that the ionization ener-
gies follow the order
K 6 Na 6 P 6 Ar 6 Ne
