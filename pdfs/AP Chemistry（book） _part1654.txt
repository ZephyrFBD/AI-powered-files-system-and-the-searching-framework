 of 
the shelves plus the books stacked on them is 262 kg. Cal-
culate the pressure in pascals exerted by the shelf footings 
on the surface.
 10.17 (a) How high in meters must a column of glycerol be to 
exert a pressure equal to that of a 760-mm column of 
mercury? The density of glycerol is 1.26 g/mL, whereas 
that of mercury is 13.6 g/mL. (b) What pressure, in at-
mospheres, is exerted on the body of a diver if she is 15 
ft below the surface of the water when the atmospheric 
pressure is 750 torr? Assume that the density of the water 
is 1.00 g>cm3 = 1.00 * 103 kg>m3. The gravitational con-
stant is 9.81 m>s2, and 1 Pa = 1 kg>m@s2.
10.18 (a) The compound 1-iodododecane is a nonvolatile liq-
uid with a density of 1.20 g>mL. The density of mercury is 
13.6 g>mL. What do you predict for the height of a barome-
ter column based on 1-iodododecane, when the atmospheric 
pressure is 749 torr?  (b) What is the pressure, in atmo-
spheres, on the body of a diver if he is 21 ft below the sur
