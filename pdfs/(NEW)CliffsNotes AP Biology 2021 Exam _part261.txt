es and ends up in separate gametes.
Thus one Y and one R end up in a single gamete. All segregation possibilities produce gametes that are YR. For the
second plant, there is also only one kind of gamete produced, yr. The next step is to determine the different ways
that the gametes from one parent can combine with the gametes from the second parent. Usually you would make a
Punnett square for this, but since each parent has only one kind of gamete, you can quickly conclude, without a
Punnett square, that all the F1offspring will result from the union of a YR gamete and a yr gamete. The result of that
union produces individuals that have the genotype YyRr, which bears the phenotype yellow and round.
Now, analyze the F2generation produced by YyRr Ã— YyRr. Each parent can
produce four kinds of gametes: YR, Yr, yR, and yr. The Punnett square, illustrated in Figure 8-5, shows the gametes
of one parent in spaces on the top line and the gametes of the second parent in spaces along the left mar
