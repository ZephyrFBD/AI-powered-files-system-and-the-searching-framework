ross investigating the traits of stem length (tall or
dwarf) and flower color (purple or white) is a dihybrid cross. Another example is a cross investigating seed color
(yellow, green) and seed texture (round, wrinkled).

Complete Dominance, Monohybrid Cross
When traits are expressed as if one allele is dominant to a second allele, the inheritance pattern is called complete
(or full) dominance. Take, for example, a monohybrid cross, in which a single trait (originating from a single
gene) is examined. For pea plants, let T a dominant allele, represent the allele for tall stems and t, the recessive
allele, represent the allele for dwarf stems. For inheritance by complete dominance, TT and Tt produce tall plants,
and tt produces dwarf plants. Suppose that a plant heterozygous for tall stems (Tt) is crossed with a dwarf-stemmed
plant (tt). The cross can be represented as Tt Ã— tt. Now, what predictions can be made for the genotypes of the
offspring?
The first step in analyzing th
