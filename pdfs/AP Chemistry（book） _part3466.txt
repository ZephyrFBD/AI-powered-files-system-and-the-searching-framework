Rates of Radioactive Decay (Section 21.4)
 21.33  Each statement that follows refers to a comparison between 
two radioisotopes, A and X. Indicate whether each of the 
following statements is true or false.
(a) If the half-life for A is shorter than the half-life for X, A 
has a larger decay rate constant.
(b) If X is “not radioactive,” its half-life is essentially zero.
(c) If A has a half-life of 10 yr, and X has a half-life of 
10,000 yr, A would be a more suitable radioisotope to 
measure processes occurring on the 40-yr time scale.
