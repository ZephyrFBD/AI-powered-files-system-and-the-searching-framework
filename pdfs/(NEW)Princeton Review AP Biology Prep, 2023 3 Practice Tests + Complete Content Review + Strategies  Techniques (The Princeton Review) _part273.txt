 model organisms because they have only
one CDK protein each and a few different cyclins. This relatively simple system allowed biologists to figure out
how cell cycle progression is controlled. Their findings were then used to figure out how more complex eukaryotes
(such as mammals) control the cell cycle.
Cancer
A cell losing control of the cell cycle can have disastrous consequences. For example, a mutation in a protein that
normally controls progression through the cell cycle can result in unregulated cell division and cancer. Cancer
means “crab,” as in the zodiac sign. The name comes from the observation that malignant tumors grow into
surrounding tissue, embedding themselves like clawed crabs. Cancer occurs when normal cells start behaving and
growing very abnormally and spread to other parts of the body.
Mutated genes that induce cancer are called oncogenes (“onco-” is a prefix denoting cancer). Normally, these genes
are required for proper growth of the cell and regulation of t
