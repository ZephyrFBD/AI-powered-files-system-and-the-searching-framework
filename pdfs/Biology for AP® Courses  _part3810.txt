rs out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in the afferent
arteriole. The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure.
The “leaky” connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through
easily. All solutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion.
There is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration process. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume
of glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys. GFR is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important
indicator of kidney function.
