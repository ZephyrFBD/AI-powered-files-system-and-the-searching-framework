e? The radius increases and the energy of 
attraction between the electron and the nucleus approaches zero, so when n = ∞ the 
electron is completely separated from the nucleus and the energy of the electron is zero:
 
E = 1-2.18 * 10 - 18 J2a 1
∞2 b = 0
The state in which the electron is completely separated from the nucleus is called the refer-
ence, or zero-energy, state of the hydrogen atom.
In his third postulate, Bohr assumed that the electron can “jump” from one 
allowed orbit to another by either absorbing or emitting photons whose radiant 
energy corresponds exactly to the energy difference between the two orbits. The elec-
tron must absorb energy in order to move to a higher-energy state (higher value of n). 
Conversely, radiant energy is emitted when the electron jumps to a lower-energy state 
(lower value of n).
Let’s consider a case in which the electron jumps from an initial state with principal 
quantum number ni and energy Ei to a final state with principal quantum numb
