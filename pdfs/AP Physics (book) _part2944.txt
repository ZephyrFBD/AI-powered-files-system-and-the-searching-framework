Most physicists prefer
to consider the mass
of a particle as fixed
SECTION 26–9
E = mc2; Mass and Energy

We can rearrange Eq. 26–5b to get
We call 
the total energy E of the particle (assuming no potential energy),
because it equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy:
(26–6a)
The total energy† can also be written, using Eqs. 26–5, as
(26–6b)
For a particle at rest in a given reference frame, ke is zero in Eq. 26–6a, so
the total energy is its rest energy:
(26–7)
Here we have Einstein’s famous formula,
This formula mathematically
relates the concepts of energy and mass. But if this idea is to have any physical
meaning, then mass ought to be convertible to other forms of energy and vice
versa. Einstein suggested that this might be possible, and indeed changes of mass
to other forms of energy, and vice versa, have been experimentally confirmed
countless times in nuclear and elementary particle physics. For example, an elec-
tron and a positron (
a positive electron
