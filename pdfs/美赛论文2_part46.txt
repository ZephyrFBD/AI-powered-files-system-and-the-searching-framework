determine the suitable position of the treatment center. Secondly, we make a 
table based on the improved EVA spread model 2 to predict the total number 
of the drugs and the vaccines needed to be distributed from the treatment 
center in the next week. Thirdly, we predict the proportion of medication 
needed to be distributed to each city based on the improved EVA spread model 
2. There are two objectives in our delivery model: To minimize the total cost 
of the transport and to minimize the distribution time. 
 
V. Future work 
 The Spread Model using actual data to simulate future trend provides a 
practical way of thinking which could be applied to many fields such as 
finance, administration etc. The Spread Model needs to be improved 
because the relationships between λ and t, μ and t are so sophisticated that 
they cannot always
