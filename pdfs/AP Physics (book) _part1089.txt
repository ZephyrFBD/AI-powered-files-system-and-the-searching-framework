Surface Tension and Capillarity
281
Because of surface tension, some insects (Fig. 10–35a) can walk on water, and
objects more dense than water, such as a paper clip (Fig.10–35b), can float on the
surface. Figure 10–36a shows how the surface tension can support the weight w of an
object. Actually, the object sinks slightly into the fluid, so w is the “effective
