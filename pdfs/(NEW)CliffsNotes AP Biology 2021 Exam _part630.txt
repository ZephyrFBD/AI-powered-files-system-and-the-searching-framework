other, more meaningful events.
Observational learning and insight provide a mechanism to learn new behaviors in response to unexpected events
without receiving reinforcement. This reduces the time required for new behaviors to be acquired.
General Animal Behaviors
During any typical day of activities, an animal encounters a variety of situations. To each it must respond in a way

The fight-or-flight response occurs when an animal encounters a situation where it must choose to fight or flee.
The response, triggered by stress, stimulates the nervous system to produce adrenaline or noradrenaline (epinephrine

rate, increasing the release of sugar
