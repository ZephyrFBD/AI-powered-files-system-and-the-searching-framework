 oȇen ends in -ase. For example, the
lactase enzyme breaks the complex sugar lactose into the simple sugars
glucose and galactose. The enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase removes a
carbon from the three-carbon molecule pyruvate. Thinking about
enzyme names in this way may be helpful on the AP Biology exam.

For the exam, you should be familiar with the term catalyst, which refers
to any chemical agent that accelerates a reaction without being
permanently changed in the reaction. Enzymes are biological catalysts,
which can be used over and over again.
Enzyme specificity means that an enzyme will only catalyze one specific
reaction. Molecules upon which an enzyme acts are called substrates,
and the substrate binds to the active site on the enzyme, speeding up the
conversion from substrate to product.
All enzymes possess an active site, a 3-D pocket within their structure in
which substra
