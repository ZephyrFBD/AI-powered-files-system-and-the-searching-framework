Figure 29.21 Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. The periosteum
is the connective tissue on the outside of bone that acts as the interface between bone, blood vessels, tendons, and
ligaments.
Growth of Bone
Long bones continue to lengthen, potentially until adolescence, through the addition of bone tissue at the epiphyseal plate.
They also increase in width through appositional growth.
Lengthening of Long Bones
Chondrocytes on the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate divide; one cell remains undifferentiated near the epiphysis,
and one cell moves toward the diaphysis. The cells, which are pushed from the epiphysis, mature and are destroyed by
calcification. This process replaces cartilage with bone on the diaphyseal side of the plate, resulting in a lengthening of the
bone.
Long bones stop growing at around the age of 18 in females and the age of 21 in males in a process called epiphyseal plate
closure. During this process,
