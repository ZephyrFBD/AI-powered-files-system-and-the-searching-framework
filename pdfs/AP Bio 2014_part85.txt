same section of a forest. For 
each observed pair of nesting adults, the biologist measured the distance to the next closest nesting pair of the 
same species (nearest-neighbor distance). An analysis of the results is shown in the table below.

Which of the following would be most appropriate for identifying the species with the most even distribution of 
nests? 
(A) Area of the forest in which the nearest-neighbor measurements were made 
(B) Total number of nearest-neighbor observations collected during the study period  
(C) Standard deviation of the nearest-neighbor distances for each species 
(D) Proportion of nearest-neighbor distances that were less than the median
