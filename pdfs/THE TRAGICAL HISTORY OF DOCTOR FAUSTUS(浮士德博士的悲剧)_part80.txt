 could not wake him.  I, seeing
that, took him by the leg, and never rested pulling till I had pulled me his
leg quite off; and now 'tis at home in mine hostry.
ROBIN. And has the doctor but one leg, then? that's excellent; for one
of his devils turned me into the likeness of an ape's face.
CARTER. Some more drink, hostess!
ROBIN. Hark you, we'll into another room and drink a while, and then
we'll go seek out the doctor. [Exeunt.]
Enter the DUKE OF VANHOLT, his DUCHESS, FAUSTUS,
MEPHISTOPHILIS, and ATTENDANTS.
DUKE. Thanks, Master Doctor, for these pleasant sights; nor know I
how sufficiently to recompense your great deserts in erecting that
enchanted castle in the air,<210> the sight whereof so delighted<211> me
as nothing in the world could please me more.
FAUSTUS. I do think myself, my good lord, highly recompensed in
that it pleaseth<212> your grace to think but well of that which Faustus
hath performed.--But, gracious lady, it may be that you have taken no
pleasure in those sights
