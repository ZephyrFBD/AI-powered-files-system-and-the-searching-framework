e, not phenotype.
In the case of sickle cell anemia in West Africa, people who are hybrid
(Ss) for the sickle cell trait have the selective advantage over other
individuals. Those who are hybrid have normal hemoglobin and do not
suffer from sickle cell disease. However, they are resistant to malaria,
which is endemic in West Africa. Those individuals who are homozygous

for the sickle cell trait (ss) are at a great disadvantage because they have
abnormal hemoglobin and suffer from and may die of sickle cell disease.
People who are homozygous for normal hemoglobin (SS) do not have
sickle cell disease but are susceptible to and may die of malaria. Thus, the
mutation for the sickle cell trait is retained in the gene pool.
7. Frequency-Dependent Selection
Another mechanism that preserves variety in a population is known as
frequency-dependent selection or the minority advantage. This acts to
decrease the frequency of the more common phenotypes an
