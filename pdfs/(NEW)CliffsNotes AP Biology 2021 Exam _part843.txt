sample remains low (blue).
In treatment III, no DPIP is reduced because photosynthesis cannot occur in the absence of light. If photosynthesis
cannot occur, electrons in the pigment systems are not reduced (energized); thus, there are no energized electrons to
reduce DPIP. The DPIP remains oxidized (blue), and transmittance remains low.
c. When healthy chloroplasts are exposed to light, electrons of pigment molecules in photosystem II are energized
(reduced). These electrons are eventually passed to the special chlorophyll a (P680). Two
electrons are then passed to a primary electron acceptor, the first molecule of an electron transport chain. (An
electronic transport chain is a series of electron carriers, such as cytochromes.) As the two electrons are passed from
one carrier to the next, energy from the electrons is used to generate 1.5 ATP molecules (on average). At the end of
the chain, the two electrons are accepted by pigment molecules in photosystem I, where they are again ener
