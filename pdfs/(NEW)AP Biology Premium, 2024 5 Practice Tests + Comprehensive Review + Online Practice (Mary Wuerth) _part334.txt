rate chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
2. (C) Sex-linked genes are more likely to be expressed in males since males have only one X chromosome.
Choice (A) is incorrect because sex-linked genes are more likely, not less likely, to be expressed in males.
Females have two X chromosomes, so a sex-linked recessive trait is less likely to be expressed in females
because a female would have to inherit two copies of the allele while a male would only have to inherit one
copy of the allele for it to be expressed. Thus, choices (B) and (D) are both incorrect.
3. (D) AaBbCc has the least number of dominant alleles (three) out of all the answer choices given. So the additive
effect of the alleles in that genotype would be the least, and this genotype would result in the smallest seed.
Since each dominant allele contributes to increased seed size, choice (A) is incorrect because it has the highest
number of dominant alleles out of all the answer choices given. So it would produce the
