look like if the volume and temperature remained 
constant while you removed enough of the gas to decrease 
the pressure by a factor of 2? [Section 10.3]
(a) It would contain the same number of molecules.
(b) It would contain half as many molecules.
(c) It would contain twice as many molecules.
(d) There is insufficient data to say.
 10.4  Imagine that the reaction 2 CO1g2 + O21g2 ยก 2 CO21g2 
occurs in a container that has a piston that moves to maintain 
a constant pressure when the reaction occurs at constant tem-
perature. Which of the following statements describes how the 
volume of the container changes due to the reaction: (a) the 
volume increases by 50%, (b) the volume increases by 33%, 
(c) the volume remains constant, (d) the volume decreases by 
33%, (e) the volume decreases by 50%. [Sections 10.3 and 10.4]
 
10.5  Suppose you have a fixed amount of an ideal gas at a constant 
volume. If the pressure of the gas is doubled while the volume is 
held constant, what happens to
