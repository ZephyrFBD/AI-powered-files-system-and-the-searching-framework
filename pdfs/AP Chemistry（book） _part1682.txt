 for Xe, cal-
culate the radius of a Xe atom and compare it to the value 
found in Figure 7.7, that is, 1.40 Ã…. Recall that the volume of 
a sphere is 14>32pr3.

Table 10.3 shows that the van der Waals b parameter has 
units of L/mol. This means that we can calculate the sizes 
of atoms or molecules from the b parameter. Refer back to 
the discussion in Section 7.3. Is the van der Waals radius we 
calculate from the b parameter of Table 10.3 more closely 
associated with the bonding or nonbonding atomic radius 
discussed there? Explain.

10.97 Torricelli, who invented the barometer, used mercury in 
its construction because mercury has a very high density, 
which makes it possible to make a more compact barome-
ter than one based on a less dense fluid. Calculate the den-
sity of mercury using the observation that the column of 
mercury is 760 mm high when the atmospheric pressure is 
1.01 * 105 Pa. Assume the tube containing the mercury is 
a cylinder wi
