tactile, proprioceptors, and baroreceptors. Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due
to physical deformation of their plasma membranes. They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or
close in response to pressure, touch, stretching, and sound.” There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin:
Merkel’s disks, Meissner’s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, and Pacinian corpuscle; two are located toward the surface of the
skin and two are located deeper. A fifth type of mechanoreceptor, Krause end bulbs, are found only in specialized regions.
Merkel’s disks (shown in Figure 27.5) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis, both in skin
that has hair and on glabrous skin, that is, the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers, the soles of the feet, and the
lips of humans and other primates. Merkel’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips. They are slow-adapting,
encapsulated nerve endings, and they respond to light touch. L
