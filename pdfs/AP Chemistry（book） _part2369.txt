From Equation 15.5, we see that the quotient of two rate constants is another constant, 
which as we will learn is called the equilibrium constant. We also see that, at equilibrium, 
the ratio of the concentration terms equals this same constant. It makes no difference 
whether we start with N2O4 or with NO2, or even with some mixture of the two. At equi-
librium, at a given temperature, the ratio equals a specific value. Thus, there is an import-
ant constraint on the proportions of N2O4 and NO2 at equilibrium.

Give It Some Thought
Which of the following variables are equal when the N2O41g2 âˆ†2 NO21g2 
reaction reaches equilibrium: (a) kf and kr, (b) the forward and reverse reaction rates,
(c) the concentrations of 3N2O44 and 3NO24?
Once equilibrium is established, the concentrations of N2O4 and NO2 no lon-
ger change, as shown in Figure 15.3(a
