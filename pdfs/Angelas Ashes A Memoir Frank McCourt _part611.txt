g, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of 
 
 course he was a Catholic dog. Didn’t I have him in my arms? He cries 
 
 so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school.We’re so 
 
 delighted we don’t mind helping Michael with the grave and we say 
 
 three Hail Marys.We’re not going to stand there wasting a good day off 
 
 from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six 
 
 but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and 
 
 give them tea. Mam says it’s driving her crazy to come home and find 
 
 these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and 
 
 scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit 
 
 of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn’t 
 
 have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors’ doors and has no 
 
 shame begging for it. In the end she tells Michael, No more old men. 
 
 One of them left us with lice and we’re plagued.
