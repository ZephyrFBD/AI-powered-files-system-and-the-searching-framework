t cannot function. The substrate can still bind
at the active site, but the enzyme will not be able to catalyze the reaction.
Not all molecules that bind to the allosteric site of an enzyme are inhibitors.
Some enzymes are activated by allosteric regulators.
REACTION COUPLING AND ATP
As we just saw, almost everything an organism does requires energy. How, then, can the cell acquire the energy it
needs without becoming a major mess? Fortunately, itâ€™s through adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
ATP, as the name indicates, consists of a molecule of adenosine bonded to three phosphates. The great thing about
ATP is that an enormous amount of energy is packed into those phosphate bonds.
The body can perform difficult endergonic reactions by coupling them to ATP
hydrolysis, which is very exergonic.
When a cell needs energy, it takes one of these potential-packed molecules of ATP and splits off the third phosphate,
forming adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one loose phosphate (Pi ), while releasing e
