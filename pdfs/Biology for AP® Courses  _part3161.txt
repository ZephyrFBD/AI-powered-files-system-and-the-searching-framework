s to enter the cell.
d.
Polarization after peak action potential would be
affected because that is the point when K+
begins to enter the cell.

This figure shows the transfer of an action potential
through a neuron. What is occurring in panel 3?
a.
Depolarization occurs closest to the cell body.
b.
The first part of the neuron cannot fire another
action potential.
c.
The first part of the neuron can fire another
action potential.
d.
Sodium channels have closed.

This figure depicts an essential component of signal
formation and transmission in neurons. What is happening
in this figure?
a.
A nerve impulse opens the Na+ channel, which
makes Na+ enter the cell and depolarizes the
membrane.
b.
A nerve impulse opens the Ca+2 channel, which
makes Ca+2 enter the cell and depolarizes the
membrane.
c.
A nerve impulse opens the Na+ channel, which
makes Na+ enter the cell and repolarizes the
membrane.
d.
A nerve impulse opens the K+ channel, which
makes
