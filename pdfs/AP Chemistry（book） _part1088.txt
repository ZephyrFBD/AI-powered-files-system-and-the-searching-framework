Ionic size plays a major role in determining the properties of devices 
that rely on movement of ions, such as batteries. “Lithium-ion” batter-
ies, which have become common energy sources for electronic devices 
such as cell phones, iPads, laptop computers, and electric vehicles rely 
in part on the small size of the lithium ion for their operation.
A fully charged battery spontaneously produces an electric 
 
current and, therefore, power when its positive and negative elec-
trodes are connected to an electrical load, such as a device to be 
powered. The positive electrode is called the anode, and the negative 
electrode is called the cathode. The materials used for the electrodes 
in lithium-ion batteri
