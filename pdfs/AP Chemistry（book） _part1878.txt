Metal ion (nucleus
+ core electrons)
Sea of mobile
valence electrons
▲ Figure 12.20 Electron-sea model of 
metallic bonding. The valence electrons 
delocalize to form a sea of mobile electrons 
that surrounds and binds together an 
extended array of metal ions.
The ability of metals to deform (their malleability and ductility) can be explained by 
the fact that metal atoms form bonds to many neighbors. Changes in the positions of the 
atoms brought about in reshaping the metal are partly accommodated by a redistribution 
of electrons.
Molecular Orbital Model
Although the electron-sea model works surprisingly well given its simplicity, it does not 
adequately explain many properties of metals. According to the model, for example, 
the strength of bonding between metal atoms shou
