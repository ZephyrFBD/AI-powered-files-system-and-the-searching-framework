Newton’s Synthesis
Where did we first get the idea of planets? Have you ever escaped the lights of
the city to gaze late at night at the multitude of stars in the night sky? It is a
moving experience. Thousands of years ago, the ancients saw this sight every
cloudless night, and were fascinated. They noted that the vast majority of stars,
bright or dim, seemed to maintain fixed positions relative to each other. The
ancients imagined these fixed stars as being attached to a huge inverted bowl, or
sphere. This celestial sphere revolved around the Earth almost exactly once a day
(Fig. 5–27), from east to west. Among all the stars that were visible to the naked
eye (there were no telescopes until much later, about 1600), the ancients saw five
stars that changed position relative to the fixed stars over weeks and months.
These five wandering stars were called planets (Greek for wandering). Planets
were thus visible at night as tiny points of light like other
