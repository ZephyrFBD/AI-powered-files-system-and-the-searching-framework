s it is 
cooled. (b) Crystals of iodine disappear from an evaporat-
ing dish as they stand in a fume hood. (c) Rubbing alcohol 
in an open container slowly disappears. (d) Molten lava 
from a volcano turns into solid rock.
 11.41  (a) What phase change is represented by the “heat of fusion” 
of a substance? (b) Is the heat of fusion endothermic or exo-
thermic? (c) If you compare a substance’s heat of fusion to 
its heat of vaporization, which one is generally larger?
 11.42  Ethyl chloride 1C2H5Cl2 boils at 12 °C. When liquid C2H5Cl 
under pressure is sprayed on a room-temperature 125 °C2 
surface in air, the surface is cooled considerably. (a) What 
does this observation tell us about the speciﬁc heat of 
C2H5Cl1g2 as compared with that of C2H5Cl1l2? (b) Assume 
that the heat lost by the surface is gained by ethyl chloride. 
What enthalpies must you consider if you were to calculate 
the ﬁnal temperature of the surface?
