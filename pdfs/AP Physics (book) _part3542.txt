olar neutrinos pass through a 
ceiling of a room, at latitude 
, for an hour around
midnight on midsummer night. [Hint: See Problems 62
and 63.]
65. Estimate how much total energy would be released via
fission if 2.0 kg of uranium were enriched to 5% of the
isotope
66. Some stars, in a later stage of evolution, may begin to fuse
two 
nuclei into one 
nucleus. (a) How much energy
would be released in such a reaction? (b) What kinetic energy
must two carbon nuclei each have when far apart, if they can
then approach each other to within 6.0 fm, center-to-center?
(c) Approximately what temperature would this require?
67. An average adult body contains about 
of 
which comes from food. (a) How many decays occur per
second? (b) The potassium decay produces beta particles
with energies of around 1.4 MeV. Estimate the dose per
year in sieverts for a 65-kg adult. Is this a significant frac-
tion of the 
background rate?
68. When the nuclear reactor accident occurred at Chernobyl
in 1986,
were r
