y were undergoing
microevolution. Recall that you counted 600 blue flowers and 200 red flowers.

Imagine that you return four years after your initial visit, and the flowers at the site have been split into two
different populations by a newly formed river, which isolates the two populations. In the population 1, you
counted 125 blue flowers and 10 red flowers. In the population 2, you counted 450 blue flowers and 300 red
flowers. Did genetic drift or natural selection likely cause these change in allele frequencies in population 1?
What about population 2? Explain how you know for each population.
19.3 | Adaptive Evolution
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are different ways in which natural selection can shape populations?
•
How can these different forces lead to different outcomes in terms of population variation?

As we have learned, natural selection acts on the level of the individual, selecting those with a higher overa
