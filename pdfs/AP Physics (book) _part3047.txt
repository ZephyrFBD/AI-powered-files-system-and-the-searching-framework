ly emitted by the gas. This is called an absorption
spectrum (Fig. 27–23c), and it became clear that gases can absorb light at the 
same frequencies at which they emit. Using film sensitive to ultraviolet and to
infrared light, it was found that gases emit and absorb discrete frequencies in
these regions as well as in the visible.
