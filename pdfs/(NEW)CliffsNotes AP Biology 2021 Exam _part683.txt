nditions change, r-selected species are gradually replaced by more stable K-
selected species. These include perennial grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees. Because K-selected species live longer,
their environmental effects slow down the rate of succession. Once the climax community is established, it may
remain essentially unchanged for hundreds of years.
There are two kinds of succession, as follows:
1. Primary succession occurs on substrates that never previously supported living things. For example, primary
succession occurs on volcanic islands, on lava flows, and on rock left behind by retreating glaciers. Two examples
follow:
Succession on rock or lava usually begins with the establishment of lichens. Hyphae of the fungal component of the
lichen attach to rocks, the fungal mycelia hold moisture that would otherwise drain away, and the lichen secretes
acids that help erode rock into soil. As soil accumulates, bacteria, protists, mosses, and fungi appear, followed by
insects and othe
