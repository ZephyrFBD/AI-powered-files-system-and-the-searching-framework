14.6 ∣ Reaction Mechanisms
A balanced equation for a chemical reaction indicates the substances present at the start 
of the reaction and those present at the end of the reaction. It provides no information, 
however, about the detailed steps that occur at the molecular level as the reactants are 
turned into products. The steps by which a reaction occurs is called the reaction mech-
anism. At the most sophisticated level, a re
