(a) sulfur dioxide, (b) phosphorus pentachloride, (c) dichlorine 
trioxide.

Although hydrocarbons are binary molecular compounds, they are not named like 
the binary inorganic compounds discussed in Section 2.8. Instead, each alkane has a

name that ends in -ane. The alkane with four carbons is called butane. For alkanes with 
five or more carbons, the names are derived from prefixes like those in Table 2.6. An 
alkane with eight carbon atoms, for example, is octane 1C8H182, where the octa- prefix for 
eight is combined with the -ane ending for an alkane.
Some Derivatives of Alkanes
Other classes of organic compounds are obtained when one or more hydrogen atoms in an 
alkane are replaced with functional groups, which are specific groups of atoms. An alcohol, 
for example, is obtained by replacing an H atom of an alkane
