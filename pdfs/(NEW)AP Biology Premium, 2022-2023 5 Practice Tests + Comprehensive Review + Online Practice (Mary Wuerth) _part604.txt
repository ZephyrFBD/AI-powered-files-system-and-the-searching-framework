contents of the ecosystem are removed and dried, and the dry weights of each component are recorded. Conversion
factors for each component are used to calculate the energy stored in each trophic level. For example, Fast Plants
contain about 4.35 kilocalories of energy per gram of dry weight, and butterfly larvae contain about 5.5 kilocalories
of energy per gram of dry weight. The droppings (frass) of the butterfly larvae contain about 4.76 kilocalories of
energy per gram of dry weight. Using these conversions, the amount of energy available from each component can
be calculated, as shown in the table.
Different conditions can be used (access to light, number of seeds, number of eggs, etc.) to see how variations in
different factors affect the final results.
Lab 11: Transpiration
Transpiration is the loss of water through the stomata in the leaves of a plant. Stomata are openings in the surface
of a plant leaf through which gases can be exchanged and water may evaporate. Plants need to
