which accelerates protons from 28 GeV to the 450 GeV at which they are injected
into the LHC itself.
FIGURE 32–5 (a) The large circle
represents the position of the tunnel,
about 100 m below the ground at
CERN (near Geneva) on the
French–Swiss border, which houses
the LHC. The smaller circle shows
the position of the Super Proton
Synchrotron used for accelerating
protons prior to injection into the
LHC. (b) Circulating proton beams,
in opposite directions, inside the
vacuum tube within the LHC tunnel.

Figure 32–6 shows part of one of the detectors (ATLAS) as it was being con-
structed at the LHC. The detectors within ATLAS include silicon semiconductor
detectors with huge numbers of pixels used to track particle paths and find their
point of interaction, and to measure their radius of curvature in a magnetic field and
thus determine their
