ost cell DNA into recipient bacterial cells. In the
recipient bacterium, the donor DNA may be recycled for spare parts, it
may recircularize and become a plasmid if it was originally one, or it may
be exchanged via recombination to create a bacterium with a diﬀerent
genotype.
Conjugation
Unlike transformation and transduction, which do not involve cell-to-cell
contact, conjugation involves the transfer of genetic material between
bacteria in direct contact. If a bacterium carries a DNA sequence called
the fertility factor (F-factor), it is able to produce a pilus to draw itself
close to a recipient cell. Generally, one strand of the plasmid is
transferred through the thin tube-like structure. Both bacteria then
synthesize complementary strands of the plasmid, which recircularizes.
Conjugation oȇen benefits the recipient by providing resistance,
tolerance, or a new ability. If the F-factor is transferred, the receiving cell
becomes a donor and is able to make its own pilus.
