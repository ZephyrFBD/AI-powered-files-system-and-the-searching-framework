ive properties can be used, as shown in Sample 
Exercises 13.10 and 13.11.
A solution of an unknown nonvolatile nonelectrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.250 g of the substance in 40.0 g of CCl4. The 
boiling point of the resulting solution was 0.357 °C higher than that of the pure solvent. Calculate the molar mass of the solute.
Sample Exercise 13.10 
Molar Mass from Freezing-Point Depression or Boiling-Point Elevation
SOLUTION
Analyze Our goal is to calculate the molar mass of a solute based 
on knowledge of the boiling-point elevation of its solution in 
CCl4, ∆T
b = 0.357 °C, and the masses of solute and solvent. Table 
13.3 gives Kb for the solvent 1CCl42, Kb = 5.02 °C>m.
Plan We can use Equation 13.12, ∆T
b = iKbm, to calculate the mo-
lality of the solution. Because the solute is a nonelectrolyte, i = 1. 
Then we can use molality and the quantity of solvent 140.0 g CCl42 
to calculate the number of moles of solute. Finally, the molar mass 
of the solute equals the number of gr
