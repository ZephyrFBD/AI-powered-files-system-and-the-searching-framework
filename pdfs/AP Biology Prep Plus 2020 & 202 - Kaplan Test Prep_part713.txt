for high milk
production, resulting in gradual improvements in milk
production across each generation.
(C)
Researchers breed unrelated animals to increase genetic
diversity and reduce the risk of inbreeding, which increases
milk production.

6. A geological survey of seabed sediments revealed large and
diverse populations of animal fossils dating from the Permian
through the Triassic periods. Paleontologists compiled their data
in the following diagram.
The boundary between the Permian and the Triassic periods
corresponds to the “Great Dying,” when about 90–95% of marine
life disappeared from the geological record. What is the most
likely explanation for the fossil findings of the late Triassic period?

Extinctions,” Current Biology 25, no. 19 (October 2015):
