nucleotides, has been attached to a separated strand by an enzyme
called primase.
13.3 Describe the process of DNA replication
DNA helicase unzips the DNA to ready it for replication. DNA replication is
semiconservative, meaning that half of the original DNA is conserved in
each daughter molecule. This means that the new DNA uses the existing
DNA strands as a template. When DNA splits and copies, although the two
resulting DNA strands that are created are identical to each other, one
strand is made up of the “old” DNA strand while the other daughter
strand is made of newly synthesized DNA. Okazaki fragments are formed
because DNA polymerase can only read the older DNA in a 3′ to 5′
direction and synthesize a new strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction. It works away
from the origin of replication on one side and then jumps back to follow
the unzipping DNA, but can only continue to work in a direction away
from the replication fork, thus leaving fragments of DNA that have to be
linked
