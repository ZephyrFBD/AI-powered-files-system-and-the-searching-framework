large numbers
of plankton and krill (small crustaceans) that support it. These two environments are especially important to aerobic
respirators worldwide as the phytoplankton perform 40 percent of all photosynthesis on Earth. Although not as diverse as
the other two, deep ocean ecosystems contain a wide variety of marine organisms. Such ecosystems exist even at the bottom
of the ocean where light is unable to penetrate through the water.
Freshwater ecosystems are the rarest, occurring on only 1.8 percent of the Earth's surface. Lakes, rivers, streams, and
springs comprise these systems; they are quite diverse, and they support a variety of fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects,
phytoplankton, fungi, and bacteria.
Terrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called biomes, such as tropical
rain forests, savannas, deserts, coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and tundra. Grouping these ecosystems into just a few
biome categories obscures the g
