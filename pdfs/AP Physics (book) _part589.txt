ork on the nail:
and is positive. The decrease in kinetic energy of the
hammer (
by Eq. 6â€“4) is equal to the work the hammer can do on another
object, the nail in this case.
The translational kinetic energy 
is directly proportional to the mass
of the object, and it is also proportional to the square of the speed. Thus, if the
mass is doubled, the kinetic energy is doubled. But if the speed is doubled, the
object has four times as much kinetic energy and is therefore capable of doing four
times as much work.
Because of the direct connection between work and kinetic energy, energy is
measured in the same units as work: joules in SI units. [The energy unit is ergs in
the cgs, and foot-pounds in the British system.] Like work, kinetic energy is a
scalar quantity. The kinetic energy of a group of objects is the sum of the kinetic
energies of the individual objects.
The work-energy principle can be applied to a particle, and also to an object
that can be approximated as a particle, such as
