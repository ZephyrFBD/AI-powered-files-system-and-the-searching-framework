omosomes. Each of the four daughter
cells then divides by mitosis to produce two ascospores. The resulting order of the eight ascospores in the ascus
corresponds to the alignment of chromatids during meiosis. If no crossing over occurs, then each set of four adjacent
ascospores represents a single parent strain and will possess the same traits. This is illustrated in the center of Figure
17-7 for a trait that determines spore color.

If crossing over occurs ( Figure 17-7, right), then traits on two nonsister chromatids exchange, producing alternating
patterns of ascospore pairs with and without the traits included in the crossover.
In this part of the investigation, you observe asci under the microscope to determine crossover frequency. Here is a
summary of the steps:
1. Grow two fungal strains of the same species, each bearing ascospores of a different color, on a plate of nutrient-
enriched agar. Perithecia form at the interface between the two strains and exhibit hybrid a
