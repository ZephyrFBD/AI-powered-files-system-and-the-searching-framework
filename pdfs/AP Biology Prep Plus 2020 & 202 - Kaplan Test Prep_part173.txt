ze that this is due to oxidative stress that alters the
cell membrane and disrupts the function of aﬀected brain cells.
Which of the following provides the best explanation for how this
occurs?
Questions 9–10
The questions that follow refer to the three transport processes shown
below.
The oxidative stress increases the amount of channels in the
membrane, disrupting normal ion levels.
(A)
The disruption of the cell membrane causes fewer muscarinic
receptors to be embedded on the cell surface.
(B)
The oxidative stress increases the amount of cholesterol in
the membrane, making it diﬀicult for integral proteins to stay
secured in the membrane.
(C)
The disruption of the cell membrane causes fewer nicotinic
receptors to be embedded on the cell surface.
(D)
9. Which of these transport processes requires the input of energy?
Process A requires the input of energy because molecules must
move rapidly to cross membranes without protein channels.
(A)
Process B requires the input of energy becaus
