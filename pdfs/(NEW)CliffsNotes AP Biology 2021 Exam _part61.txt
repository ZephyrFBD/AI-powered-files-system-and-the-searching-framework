lism), the formation of new products (synthesis or anabolism), or the transferring
of energy from one substance to another. Metabolic processes have the following characteristics in common:
1. The net direction of metabolic reactions, that is, whether the overall reaction proceeds in the forward direction or
in the reverse direction, is determined by the concentration of the reactants and the end products. Chemical
equilibrium describes the condition where the rate of reaction in the forward direction equals the rate in the reverse
direction, and, as a result, there is no net production of reactants or products. When the reaction shown below is in
chemical equilibrium, the rate at which molecules of C and D are formed (in the forward direction) is the same as
the rate at which molecules of A and B are formed (in the reverse direction).
2. Enzymes are globular proteins that act as catalysts (activators or accelerators) for metabolic reactions. Note the
following characteristics of enzym
