Vakil. A huge thank you to them and to Prof. Giuseppe Molesini for his sugges-
tions and his exceptional photographs for optics.
For Chapters 32 and 33 on Particle Physics and Cosmology and Astrophysics,
I was fortunate to receive generous input from some of the top experts in the field,
to whom I owe a debt of gratitude: Saul Perlmutter, George Smoot, Richard
Muller, Steven Boggs, Alex Filippenko, Paul Richards, James Siegrist, and William
Holzapfel (UC Berkeley), Andre√≠ Linde (Stanford U.), Lyman Page (Princeton 
and WMAP), Edward Wright (UCLA and WMAP), Michael Strauss (University
of Oklahoma), Michael Barnett (LBNL), and Bob Jacobsen (UC Berkeley; so
helpful in many areas, including digital and pedagogy).
I also wish to thank Profs. Howard Shugart, Chair Frances Hellman, and many
others at the University of California, Berkeley, Physics Department for helpful
discussions, and for hospitality. Thanks also to Profs. Tito Arecchi, Giuseppe
