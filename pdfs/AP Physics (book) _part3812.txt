000 km?) 
For these reasons we make use of the “powers of 10,” or exponential nota-
tion. The distance from Neptune to the Sun is then expressed as 
(assuming that the value is significant to three digits), and the diameter of an
atom 
This way of writing numbers is based on the use of
exponents, where 
signifies a multiplied by itself n times. For example,
Thus,
4,500,000,000. Notice that the exponent (9 in this case) is just the number of
places the decimal point is moved to the right to obtain the fully written-out
number (4.500,000,000.)
When two numbers are multiplied (or divided), you first multiply (or divide) 
the simple parts and then the powers of 10. Thus,
multiplied by 
equals
where we have used the rule for
adding exponents (AppendixA–2). Similarly,
divided by
equals
For numbers less than 1, say 0.01, the exponent power of 10 is written with a
negative sign (see previous page):
Similarly,
The decimal point has again been moved the number of places
expressed in the exponent
