ths. The dependent variable is the size of the gas
bubbles (in mm) after 30 minutes. Experimental controls include the intensity of the lights, the type of
plant, and the amount of the plant in the tubes.
(c) The gas bubble would be expected to be at least 10.4 mm or larger.
(d) Based on the data shown, the increase in the size of the gas bubble with increasing temperature indicates a
direct relationship with the temperature. Photosynthesis is a chemical process, and increased kinetic energy
from the increased water temperature would increase chemical reactions, producing more oxygen gas at
25°C than at the lower temperatures.
4.
(a) The three steps in cell signaling are reception (binding of the ligand to its receptor), transduction (the steps
that occur after the binding of the ligand that trigger the appropriate response), and response (the cell’s
desired response to the presence of the ligand).
(b) Cell signals are amplified in the cell when one chemical reaction in the transductio
