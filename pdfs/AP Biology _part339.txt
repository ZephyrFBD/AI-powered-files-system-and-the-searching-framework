molecule that inhabits a bacterium. A bacterium can harbor many
plasmids and will express the genes carried by the plasmid. These
genes may impart an advantage to the host bacterium. The first
plasmid discovered was the F plasmid. F stands for fertility.
Bacteria that contain the F plasmid are called F+; those that do not
carry the plasmid are called Fâ€“. The F plasmid contains genes for
the production of pili, cytoplasmic bridges that connect to an
adjacent cell and that allow DNA to move from one cell to another
in a form of primitive sexual reproduction called conjugation.
Another plasmid, the R plasmid, makes the cell in which it is
carried resistant to specific antibiotics, such as ampicillin or
tetracycline. In addition, the R plasmid can be transferred to other
bacteria by conjugation. Bacteria that carry the R plasmid have a
distinct evolutionary advantage over bacteria that are not resistant
to antibiotics. Resistant bacteria will be selected for (survi
