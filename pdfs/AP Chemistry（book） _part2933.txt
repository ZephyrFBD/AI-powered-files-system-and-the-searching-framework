to changes in atmospheric CO2 levels. As discussed in Section 18.2, 
the atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen by approximately 30% 
over the past three centuries to the present level of 400 ppm. Hu-
man activity has played a prominent role in this increase. Scientists 
estimate that one-third to one-half of the CO2 emissions resulting 
from human activity have been absorbed by Earth’s oceans. While 
this absorption helps mitigate the greenhouse gas effects of CO2, the 
extra CO2 in the ocean produces carbonic acid, which lowers the pH. 
Because CO3
2 -  is the conjugate base of the weak acid HCO3
-, the car-
bonate ion readily combines with the hydrogen ion:
CO3
2 -1aq2 + H+1aq2 ∆HCO3
-1aq2
This consumption of carbonate ion shifts the CaCO3 dissolution 
equilibrium to the right, increasing the solubility of CaCO3, which 
can lead to partial dissolution of calcium carbonate shells and exo-
skeletons. If the amount of atmospheric CO2 continues to increase 
at the present rate, sc
