ids. Steroids are relatively flat, nonpolar molecules. Many steroids are formed by
modifying cholesterol molecules. Examples of steroids include estradiol, testosterone, and cortisol.
Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides and function as the carriers of genetic information. Nucleotides will be
discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
Proteins
Proteins are polymers of amino acids. Amino acids have an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, a hydrogen atom,
and a side chain (R-group) attached to a central carbon, as shown in Figure 4.4. The R-group is unique for each
amino acid; it determines the amino acidâ€™s identity and whether the amino acid will be nonpolar, polar, acidic, or
basic. Proteins function in enzyme catalysis, maintaining cell structures, cell signaling, cell recognition, and more.

Protein Structure
There are four levels of protein structure, as shown in Figure 4.5.
