eriment demonstrates firsthand what occurs in all living systems
on a regular basis and points out the importance of these specialized
proteins.
The environment can also have a profound eﬀect on the reaction. In this
experiment, you measure the experimental eﬀect of changing the
reaction temperature and pH, as well as the eﬀect of changing
concentrations of the enzyme and substrate.
Catalytic activity is greatly aﬀected by temperature and increases with
increasing temperature. Because enzymes are proteins, they lose their
structure at high temperatures, not only eliminating catalytic properties
but essentially destroying the protein. Diﬀerent enzymes have diﬀerent
specific temperatures. The activity of animal catalase (catalase occurs in
plants, too) peaks at about normal body temperature, or 35–40°C. Once
the temperature increases beyond this temperature range, the catalase
proteins “die.”
How does temperature change the reactivity? Remember that the
reaction depends on free energy, s
