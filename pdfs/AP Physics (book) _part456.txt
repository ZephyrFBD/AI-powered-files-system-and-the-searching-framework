Another important case is that of an object moving in a circle, such as a ball at the
end of a string being swung in a circle above one’s head, or the nearly circular
motion of the Moon about the Earth.

The astronauts in the upper left of
this photo are working on a space
shuttle. As they orbit the Earth—at
a rather high speed—they experience
apparent weightlessness. The Moon,
in the background seen against the
blackness of space, also is orbiting
the Earth at high speed. Both the
Moon and the space shuttle move 
in nearly circular orbits,
