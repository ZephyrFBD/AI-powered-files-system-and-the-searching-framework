e suit) acquires a
speed of 
by pushing off with her legs from a 
1900-kg space capsule. (a) What is the change in speed of
the space capsule? (b) If the push lasts 0.600 s, what is the
average force exerted by each on the other? As the refer-
ence frame, use the position of the capsule before the push.
(c) What is the kinetic energy of each after the push?

force on the bottom of a 
pan due to the impacting
rain which we assume does not rebound. Water has a mass of
21. (II) A 95-kg fullback is running at 
to the east and is
stopped in 0.85 s by a head-on tackle by a tackler running
due west. Calculate (a) the original momentum of the 
fullback, (b) the impulse exerted on the fullback, (c) the
impulse exerted on the tackler, and (d) the average force
exerted on the tackler.
22. (II) With what impulse does a 0.50-kg newspaper have to
be thrown to give it a velocity of 3.0 ms?
3.0 m
