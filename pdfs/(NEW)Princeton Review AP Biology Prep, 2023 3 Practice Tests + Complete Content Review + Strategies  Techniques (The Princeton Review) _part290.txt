he phenotype tells us
what the organism looks like. When talking about the genetic makeup of an organism, we refer to its genotype.
The genotype tells us which alleles the organism possesses.
An allele can be dominant or recessive. This is determined by which allele “wins out” over the other in a
heterozygote. The convention is to assign one of two letters for the two different alleles. The dominant allele
receives a capital letter and the recessive allele receives a lowercase of the same letter. For instance, we might
give the dominant allele for height in pea plants a T for tall. This means that the recessive allele would be t for
short.
Major components of the genetic code are shared by all modern living organisms, including ribosomes and
nucleic acids (DNA/RNA). Many core metabolic pathways are conserved across all domains, which provides
evidence for a common ancestry for all living organisms.
