e of the molecule is partially positive while the other side is
partially negative. See Figure 2.1. (SYI-1)
(C) Oily stains will dissolve only in nonpolar solvents. Each
molecule of laundry detergent is constructed so that one end of the
molecule is nonpolar and will dissolve the stain. The other end of
the molecule is polar and will be soluble in the rinse water. This is
better living through chemistry! (SYI-1)
(B) Notice that the protein in Experiment A is folded, but the protein
in Experiment B remains unchanged and unfolded. The heat shock
protein must be responsible for the folding that enabled the protein
to function. HSP is acting like a chaperone protein. In both cases,
the ribosome produces a protein. There is nothing wrong with the
ribosome. HSP does not come in contact with the DNA in this
experiment and therefore does not cause mutations. Although it is
correct that heat can denature an enzyme, no heat is applied in this
experiment. (SYI-1)
(A) DNA strands are complementary
