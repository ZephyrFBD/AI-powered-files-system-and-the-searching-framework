Examples of Logistic Growth
Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (Figure
36.10a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world,
however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure
36.10b). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below
the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around
its carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.
Think About It
Describe the rate of population growth that would be expected at various parts of the S-shaped curve of logistic growth.
