sing heart rate, breathing, and metabolism. Animals able to
regulate their internal temperature even in the face of a changing
external temperature are called endotherms, or homeotherms. Mammals
and birds are capable of this type of regulation, yet reptiles, amphibians,
and most other animals are not and are known to be cold-blooded, or
ectotherms.
There are two laws you should know that relate heat and body size:
12.6 Describe thermoregulation processes
Metabolic heat production drops in a very specific manner as body size
increases. Compared with an elephant, which might weigh 10,000
pounds, a small mammal weighing only 1 pound produces about 10
times more heat per pound than the elephant does. Yet of the two
animals, the elephant stays warmer because it has much less overall
surface area compared to internal volume than does the small mammal.
In other words, the small mammal gives oﬀ much more heat to its
surroundings.
Bigger bodies produce less body heat per pound per hour.
