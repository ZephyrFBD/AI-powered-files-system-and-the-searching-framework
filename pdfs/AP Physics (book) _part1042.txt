lan. What is it?
RESPONSE Suction cups work by pushing out the air underneath the cup.
What holds the suction cup in place is the air pressure outside it. (This can be 
a substantial force when on Earth. For example, a 10-cm-diameter suction 
cup has an area of 
The force of the atmosphere on it is
about 180 lbs!) But in outer space,
there is no air pressure to push the suction cup onto the spacecraft.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10;5
We sometimes mistakenly think of suction as something we actively do. For
example, we intuitively think that we pull the soda up through a straw. Instead,
what we do is lower the pressure at the top of the straw, and the atmosphere pushes
the soda up the straw.

Archimedes’ Principle
Objects submerged in a fluid appear to weigh less than they do when outside the
fluid. For example, a large rock that you would have difficulty lifting off the
ground can often be easily lifted from the bottom o
