17.5 ∣ Factors That Affect Solubility
Solubility is affected by temperature and by the presence of other solutes. The presence 
of an acid, for example, can have a major influence on the solubility of a substance. In 
Section 17.4, we considered the dissolving of ionic compounds in pure water. In this sec-
tion, we examine three factors that affect the solubility of ionic compounds: (1) presence 
of common ions, (2) solution pH, and (3) presence of complexing agents. We will also 
examine the phenomenon of amphoterism, which is related to the effects of both pH and 
complexing agents.
The Common-Ion Effect
The presence of either Ca2 +1aq2 or F-1aq2 in a solution reduces the solubility of CaF2, 
shifting the equilibrium concentrations to the left:
