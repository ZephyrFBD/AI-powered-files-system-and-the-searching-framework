and in what unit of measurement. For example,
“Time (minutes),” “Distance
 
(meters),” or “Water Loss (ml/m2)” are appropriate labels.
2. Provide values along each axis at regular intervals. Select values and spacing that will allow your graph to fill
as much of the graphing grid as possible. Be sure that the units on each axis are linear—that is, one unit on the axis
must have the same length anywhere on the axis.
3. Use the x-axis for the independent variable and the y-axis for the dependent variable.
 
The independent variable is the variable that you choose to manipulate—that is, the variable to which you assign
values. For example, suppose you wanted to investigate fruit fly longevity as a function of diet. The independent
variable is the type of diet. You choose to investigate diet and you assign different “values” of diet (for example,
high protein, high calorie, etc.).
The dependent variable is how the experiment responds to the independent variable. Its values are the data tha
