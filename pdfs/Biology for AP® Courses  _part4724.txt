Current Species Diversity
Despite considerable effort, knowledge of the species that inhabit the planet is limited. A recent estimate suggests that
the eukaryote species for which science has names, about 1.5 million species, account for less than 20 percent of the
total number of eukaryote species present on the planet (8.7 million species, by one estimate). Estimates of numbers of

prokaryotic species are largely guesses, but biologists agree that science has only begun to catalog their diversity. Even with
what is known, there is no central repository of names or samples of the described species; therefore, there is no way to be
sure that the 1.5 million descriptions is an accurate number. It is a best guess based on the opinions of experts in different
taxonomic groups. Given that Earth is losing species at an accelerating
