Julianne Zedalis, the College Board’s AP® Biology Curriculum Committee Co-Chair, these valuable overviews provide
meaningful support for students and instructors.
Each Connection highlights the key concepts of the section in the context of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework
and explains their importance in brief, engaging language.
The explanations build upon the knowledge gained in previous sections, reinforcing the most significant concepts
and alerting students of the foundational basis of upcoming material. This helps students build a more comprehensive
understanding and helps instructors reference prior explanations.
Direct references to the relevant sections of the AP® Curriculum Framework are first explained and then outlined in
table format emphasizing their importance and relating them to the overall design of the course. Students and teachers
using these reference tables can easily see their progression through and coverage of the required curriculum.
