ling water bath. In all cases, heat the agarose until no 
particulate matter can be seen in the solution or stuck to the bottom of the flask. Be 
careful to prevent boiling over and/or scalding. 
For four-station kit: Add 2.4 grams of agarose to 300 mL of 1x TAE buffer. Follow the 
instructions described above. 
When the agarose cools (but before it solidifies), it is ready to be poured in the gel 
casting trays. Pour enough agarose into each tray until the volume is about halfway up 
each comb (approximately 50 mL per tray). 
Mix agarose 
and buffer. 
1. 
Boil mixture 
in microwave. 
2. 
Cool the mixture to 65˚C 
and pour into mold. 
3. 
Gel solidiﬁes at 
room temperature. 
Insert comb into 
mold to make wells. 
Remove comb; 
wells remain.
