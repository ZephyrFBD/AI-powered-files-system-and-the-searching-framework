form when all of the limiting reagent reacts. (Section 3.7)
theory A tested model or explanation that has predictive powers 
and that accounts for all available observations. (Section 1.3)
thermochemistry The relationship between chemical reactions 
and energy changes.  
(Chapter 5: Introduction)

thermonuclear reaction Another name for fusion reactions; 
reactions in which two light nuclei are joined to form a more 
massive one. (Section 21.8)
thermoplastic A polymeric material that can be readily reshaped 
by application of heat and pressure. (Section 12.8)
thermosetting plastic A plastic that is formed by irreversible 
chemical processes and therefore is not readily reshaped by 
application of heat and pressure. (Section 12.8)
third law of thermodynamics A law stating that the entropy of 
a pure, crystalline solid at absolute zero temperature is zero: 
S10 K2 = 0. (Secti
