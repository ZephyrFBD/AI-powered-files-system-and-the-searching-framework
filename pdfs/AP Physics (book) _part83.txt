 in doing a Problem even though they are present in the
real world, and then our calculation is only an approximation. In doing Problems,
we should be aware of what approximations we are making, and be aware 
that the precision of our answer may not be nearly as good as the number of
significant figures given in the result.
Accuracy vs.Precision
There is a technical difference between “precision” and “accuracy.” Precision in
a strict sense refers to the repeatability of the measurement using a given instru-
ment. For example, if you measure the width of a board many times, getting
results like 8.81 cm, 8.85 cm, 8.78 cm, 8.82 cm (interpolating between the 0.1 cm
marks as best as possible each time), you could say the measurements give a
precision a bit better than 0.1 cm. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement
is to the true value. For example, if the ruler shown in Fig. 1–5 was manufac-
tured with a 2% error, the accuracy of its measurement of the board’s width
(about 8.8 cm) would
