e structure
of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies.
The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture
(genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as
fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels.
Basic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material (DNA and RNA)
To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made
of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate groups on
these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome.
DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated
by exposure to high temp
