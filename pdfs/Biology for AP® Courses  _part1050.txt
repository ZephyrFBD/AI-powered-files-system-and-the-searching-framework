ping new prevention methods
and treatment strategies that will inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the
body. As mentioned earlier, signaling pathways control cell growth. These signaling pathways are controlled
by signaling proteins, which are, in turn, expressed by genes. Mutations in these genes can result in
malfunctioning signaling proteins. This prevents the cell from regulating its cell cycle, triggering unrestricted
cell division and cancer. The genes that regulate the signaling proteins are one type of oncogene, which is
a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. The gene encoding RAS is an oncogene that was originally
discovered when mutations in the RAS protein were linked to cancer. Further studies have indicated that 30
percent of cancer cells have a mutation in the RAS gene that leads to uncontrolled growth. If left unchecked,
uncontrolled cell division can lead to tumor formation and metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in new
