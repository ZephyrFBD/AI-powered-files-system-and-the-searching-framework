 must be completed three times to produce a single three-
carbon GA3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule.
Which of the following statements is true?
a.
In photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP and NADPH are reactants. GA3P and water are products.
b.
In photosynthesis, chlorophyll, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. GA3P and oxygen are products.
c.
In photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, ATP and NADPH are reactants. RuBP and oxygen are products.
d.
In photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. GA3P and oxygen are products.
RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP. For each CO2 molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules
of another compound (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle involves only one
RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the same, as the
atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 atoms from 3CO2 + 1
