Cell Communication
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
In this chapter, you will review how to:
8.1 Diﬀerentiate between stimulatory and inhibitory transduction
signaling
8.2 Explain how selective pressure impacts pathway choice
8.3 Describe receptor recognition of ligands and protein shape change
8.4 Explain how blocking transduction or reception aﬀects cells
8.5 Contrast distance and contact forms of cell-to-cell communication

1. Physiologists observe that epinephrine can have opposite eﬀects
on skeletal and smooth muscles. Epinephrine stimulates
contraction in skeletal muscles, whereas it slows down the
contraction of the s
