G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) are cell surface receptors
that work with the help of G protein. When a ligand, the first
messenger, binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor, it
changes the conformation of the cytoplasmic side of the receptor.
This, in turn, activates G protein—an on-off molecular switch.
When G protein is activated, or “on,” it bonds to GTP (guanosine
triphosphate, a high-energy nucleotide similar to ATP), which
activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme, in turn,
catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic-AMP (cAMP), the
second messenger. It is this cAMP that activates other molecules
inside a cell, leading to a cellular response. See Figure 3.23.
