ate) the enzyme. Sometimes an allosteric inhibitor is a
product of a series of reactions partly catalyzed by the allosteric enzyme. This is an example of feedback inhibition.
Allosteric effectors bind to special sites in the enzyme. In competitive inhibition, however, an inhibitor binds to the
active site, competing with substrate molecules. As a result, the activity of the enzyme is inhibited. Some toxins and
drugs (including penicillin, an antibiotic) are examples. Environmental factors also contribute to the activity of
enzymes. Enzymes operate best at specific temperatures and pH. Enzymes in the stomach, for example, are active
only when the pH is low.
This answer provides quite a bit of detail on the structure of proteins. Although the material is relevant, you may be
able to condense your answer to allow you time to answer other questions. On the other hand, if time were
available, you could give examples of some specific enzymes or coenzymes (both of which youâ€™ll learn about in
