tions, we can find I at 300 m and again apply Eq. 12–1 to obtain the sound
level.
SOLUTION The intensity I at 30 m is
or, dividing through by 10,
Recall that
means
(Appendix A–8). Then
so
At 300 m, 10 times as far, the intensity,
which decreases as 
, will be
as much, or 
Hence, the
sound level is
Even at 300 m, the sound is at the threshold of pain. This is why workers at air-
ports wear ear covers to protect their ears from damage (Fig. 12–4).
NOTE Here is a simpler approach that avoids Eq. 12–1. Because the intensity
decreases as the square of the distance, at 10 times the distance the intensity
decreases by
We can use the result that 10 dB corresponds to 
an intensity change by a factor of 10 (see just before Example 12–3). Then an
intensity change by a factor of 100 corresponds to a sound-level change of
This confirms our result above: 140 dB - 20 dB = 120 dB.
