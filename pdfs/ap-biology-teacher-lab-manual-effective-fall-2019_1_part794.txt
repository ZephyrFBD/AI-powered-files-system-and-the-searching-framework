he same in each organism? How 
similar is the DNA for this enzyme? How do organisms live in extreme environments, such 
as hot springs? There are many similar enzyme systems — both catabolic and anabolic 
— that are found across our current and historical living domains. Students can find 
examples on the Internet and develop presentations for the class that address concerns, 
ideas, and conclusions. 
Considering Topic A: Students must search the Internet for a specific enzyme. Using 
bioinformatics, students can investigate specific DNA sequences that are common for a 
particular enzyme. Resources for this type of information include http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Class/minicourses/ and “Incorporation of Bioinformatics Exercises into 
the Undergraduate Biochemistry Curriculum” (see Supplemental Resources).
Topic B: To understand how organisms’ survival is linked to enzymatic reactions, 
the role of abiotic factors needs to be addressed. Ask the students to assume the role 
of a farmer g
