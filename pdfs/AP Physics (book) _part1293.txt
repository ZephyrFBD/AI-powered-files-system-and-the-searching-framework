Piano strings. The highest key on a piano corresponds to a
frequency about 150 times that of the lowest key. If the string for the highest note
is 5.0 cm long, how long would the string for the lowest note have to be if it had
the same mass per unit length and was under the same tension?
APPROACH Since
the velocity would be the same on each 
string. So the frequency is inversely proportional to the length 
of the string
SOLUTION We can write, for the fundamental frequencies of each string, the ratio
where the subscripts L and H refer to the lowest and highest notes, respectively.
Thus
or 7.5 m. This would be ridic-
ulously long
for a piano.
NOTE The longer strings of lower frequency are made heavier (higher mass per
unit length), so even on grand pianos the strings are less than 3 m long.
