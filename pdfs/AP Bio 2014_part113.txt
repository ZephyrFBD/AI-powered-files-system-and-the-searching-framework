Question 1 
Catechol, a natural substance found in plants, reacts with oxygen to produce benzoquinone and water 
as represented by the chemical equation above. The reaction is catalyzed in plants by the enzyme 
polyphenol oxidase. Accumulation of benzoquinone in plant tissue results in the gradual appearance 
of a brown color.  
A student observes that lemon juice (pH 2) slows the browning of apple slices. The student claims

that lemon juice slows the browning process by altering the activity of polyphenol oxidase. To test 
the claim, the student distributes equal amounts of a dilute catechol solution to 6 identical test tubes.  
The pH of each solution was adjusted as shown in the table and the initial absorbance was recorded. 
Equal amounts
