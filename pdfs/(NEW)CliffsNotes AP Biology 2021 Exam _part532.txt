uce interleukins to stimulate a proliferation of T cells and B cells. When helper T cells bind
with macrophages, they release interleukins, or chemicals for communicating “between leukocytes.” The
interleukins initiate a sequence of positive-feedback events that result in the proliferation of interleukins,
macrophages, helper T cells, B cells, and cytotoxic T cells.
2. The humoral response (or antibody-mediated response) involves most cells and responds to antigens or
pathogens that are circulating in the lymph or blood (humor is a medieval term for body fluid). The humoral
response includes the following events:
B cells produce plasma cells. The plasma cells, in turn, release antibodies that bind with antigens or antigen-
bearing pathogens.
B cells produce memory cells . Memory cells provide future immunity.
Macrophage and helper T cells stimulate B cell production. In many cases, the antigen will not directly stimulate
the proliferation of B cells. Instead, the antigen or antigen-bea
