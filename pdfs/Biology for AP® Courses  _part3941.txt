compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead. In addition to promoting immune tolerance
of harmless antigens, other subsets of Treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response, which is an
inappropriate immune response to host cells or self-antigens. Another Treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful
pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis.
Immunological Memory
The adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon
reinvasion of the same pathogen. Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the
innate response. During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen th
