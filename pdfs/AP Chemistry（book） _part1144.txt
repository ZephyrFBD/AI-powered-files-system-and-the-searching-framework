CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
electron of the hydrogen atom is transferred to the chlorine atom—a solution of hydro-
chloric acid consists largely of H+1aq2 and Cl-1aq2 ions stabilized by the H2O solvent.* 
Indeed, the ability of molecular compounds of hydrogen with nonmetals to form  acids 
in water is one of the most important aspects of aqueous chemistry. We will discuss the 
chemistry of acids and bases in detail later in the text, particularly in Chapter 16.
Finally, as is typical for nonmetals, hydrogen also has the ability to gain an electron 
from a metal with a low ionization energy. For example, we saw in Equation 7.16 that 
hydrogen reacts with active metals to form solid metal hydrides that contain the hydride 
ion, H-. The fact that hydrogen can gain an electron further illustrates that it behaves 
much more like a nonmetal than an alkali metal.
