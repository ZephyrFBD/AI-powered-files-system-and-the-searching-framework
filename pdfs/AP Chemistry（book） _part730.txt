46.0 g>mol2, proceeds as follows:
C2H5OH1l2 + 3 O21g2 ¡ 2 CO21g2 + 3 H2O1l2 
∆H = -555 kJ
What is the enthalpy change for combustion of 15.0 g of  
ethanol?  
(a) -12.1 kJ (b) -181 kJ (c) -422 kJ (d) -555 kJ (e) -1700 kJ
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Hydrogen peroxide can decompose to water and oxygen by 
the reaction
2 H2O21l2 ¡ 2 H2O1l2 + O21g2   ∆H = -196 kJ
Calculate the quantity of heat released when 5.00 g of 
H2O21l2 decomposes at constant pressure.
 
If you hold a brick in the air and let it go, you 
know what happens: It falls as the force of gravity 
pulls it toward Earth. A process that is thermody-
namically favored to happen, such as a brick fall-
ing to the ground, is called a spontaneous process. 
 
A spontaneous process can be either fast or slow; 
the rate at which processes occur is not governed by 
 
thermodynamics.
Chemical processes can be thermodynamical-
ly favored, or spontaneous, too. By spontaneous, 
however, we do not mean that the reaction will 
form products witho
