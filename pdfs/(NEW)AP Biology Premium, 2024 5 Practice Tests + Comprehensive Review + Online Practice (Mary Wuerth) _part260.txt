gene allele occurs, the cell will still possess one
remaining unmutated tumor suppressor allele that is functional. The tumor suppressor allele that is not mutated will
help the organism identify cells that are dividing at a rate that is too fast. However, if both alleles of a tumor
suppressor gene are mutated, the growth of a tumor may occur. Tumor suppressor genes are said to function in a
recessive way because both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene must be nonfunctional for a cell to grow out of
control.
BRCA (sometimes called the “breast cancer gene”) is a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene. If a person has a BRCA mutation, he or she has a greatly
increased risk of getting certain types of cancer compared to someone without the mutation. A person with the mutation in one allele would still have
one functional tumor suppressor allele, so the occurrence of cancer would not be a certainty, but it would be a more likely occurrence than in a person
without the mutation who has two fun
