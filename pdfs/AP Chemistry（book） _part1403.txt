of the bond increases, as shown by the decrease 
in the potential energy of the two-atom system. However, Figure 9.13 also shows that 
the energy increases sharply when the distance between the two hydrogen nuclei is less 
than 0.74 Å. The increase in potential energy of the system, which becomes significant 
at short internuclear distances, is due mainly to the electrostatic repulsion between the 
nuclei. The internuclear distance at the minimum of the potential-energy curve (in 
(c) Fluorine is more electronegative than sulfur, so the bond 
dipoles point toward fluorine. For clarity, only one S ¬ F 
dipole is shown. The six S ¬F bonds are arranged octahedrally 
around the central sulfur:

Because the octahedral molecular geometry is symmetrical, 
the bond dipoles cancel, and the molecule is nonpolar, mean-
ing that m = 0.
