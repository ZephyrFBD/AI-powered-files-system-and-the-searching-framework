onal energy levels are subject to the selection rule
(as in Section 28–6):
The energy of a photon emitted or absorbed for a transition between rotational
states with angular momentum quantum number and
will be
(29;2)
We see that the transition energy increases directly with 
Figure 29–16 shows some
of the allowed rotational energy levels and transitions. Measured absorption lines
fall in the microwave or far-infrared regions of the spectrum (energies
),
and their frequencies are generally 2, 3,
times higher than the lowest one,
as predicted by Eq. 29–2.
EXERCISE A Determine the three lowest rotational energy states (in eV) for a nitrogen
molecule which has a moment of inertia
Rotational transition. A rotational transition
to
for the molecule CO has a measured absorption wavelength
(microwave region). Use this to calculate (a) the moment of inertia of the CO
molecule, and (b) the CO bond length, r.
APPROACH The absorption wavelength is used to find the energy of the
absorbed photon, and
