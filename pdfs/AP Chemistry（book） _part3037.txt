 
atoms. That is, the atoms are less free to move in random fashion because of the forma-
tion of new bonds. The decrease in the number of molecules and the resultant decrease 
in motion result in fewer possible microstates and therefore a decrease in the entropy of 
the system.
In summary, we generally expect the entropy of a system to increase for processes in 
which
1. Gases form from either solids or liquids.
2. Liquids or solutions form from solids.
3. The number of gas molecules increases during a chemical reaction.

▲ Figure 19.10 Entropy changes when 
an ionic solid dissolves in water. The ions 
become more spread out and disordered, but 
the water molecules that hydrate the ions 
become less disordered.

What major factor leads to a decrease 
in entropy as this reaction takes place?
2 NO2(g)
2 NO(g) + O2(g)
