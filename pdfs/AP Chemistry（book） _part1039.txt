tance between the two planets var-
ies depending on where each planet is in its orbit, but at the 
closest, the distance between Jupiter and Earth is 391 million 
miles. What is the minimum amount of time it takes for a 
transmitted signal from Juno to reach the Earth?
 6.85  The rays of the Sun that cause tanning and burning are in the 
ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These 
rays are categorized by wavelength. So-called UV-A radia-
tion has wavelengths in the range of 320–380 nm, whereas 
UV-B radiation has wavelengths in the range of 290–320 nm. 
 
(a) Calculate the frequency of light that has a wavelength of 
320 nm. (b) Calculate the energy of a mole of 320-nm pho-
tons. (c) Which are more energetic, photons of UV-A radia-
tion or photons of UV-B radiation? (d) The UV-B radiation 
from the Sun is considered a greater cause of sunburn in 
humans than is UV-A radiation. Is this observation consis-
tent with your answer to part (c)?
