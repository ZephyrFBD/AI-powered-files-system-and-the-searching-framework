cal reactions.
These reactions alter the expression of certain genes in the bacteria,
turning on the ones that code for enzymes, like luciferase, which trigger
the expression of the protein luciferin and produce light.
Direct Contact
Multicellular organisms contain trillions of cells that also must
communicate with each other. They do this in a variety of complex ways.
Signaling substances dissolved in the cytosol can pass freely between
adjacent cells. In animals, gap junctions permit the passage of materials
directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to the cytoplasm of an adjacent
cell. In muscle tissue of the heart, the flow of ions through gap junctions

coordinates the contractions of cardiac cells. See Figure 3.21.
Plasmodesmata connect one plant cell to the next. They are analogous to
gap junctions in animal cells.

Cell communication processes share common features that reflect a shared
evolutionary history.
