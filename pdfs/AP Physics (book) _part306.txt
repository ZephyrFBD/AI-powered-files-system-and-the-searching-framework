Problem 26.
24. (II) You buy a plastic dart gun, and being a clever physics
student you decide to do a quick calculation to find its
maximum horizontal range. You shoot the gun straight up,
and it takes 4.0 s for the dart to land back at the barrel.
What is the maximum horizontal range of your gun?
25. (II) A grasshopper hops along a level road. On each hop,
the grasshopper launches itself at angle
and
achieves a range  
What is the average hori-
zontal speed of the grasshopper as it hops along the
road? Assume that the time spent on the ground between
hops is negligible.
26. (II) Extreme-sports enthusiasts have been known to jump
off the top of El Capitan, a sheer granite cliff of height 
910 m in Yosemite National Park. Assume a jumper runs
horizontally off the top of El Capitan with speed 
and enjoys a free fall until she is 150 m above the valley
floor, at which time she opens her parac
