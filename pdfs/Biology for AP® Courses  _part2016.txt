es. Thus, their allele frequencies
at numerous genetic loci gradually become more and more different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in
each population. Typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two
populations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group.
Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion
forming a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating
over the ocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on
the biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate
nearby valleys, chances are, individuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow. However, if
