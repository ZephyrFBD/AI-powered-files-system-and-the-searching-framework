itive streak and flow inward to form the
archenteron. As cleavage and gastrulation occur, the yolk gets smaller.
Amniotes are named for the major derived character of their clade: the
amniotic egg. This egg is characterized by a series of extraembryonic
membranes: Tissue outside the embryo forms four extraembryonic
membranes necessary to support the growing embryo inside the shell.
They are the yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois. The yolk sac
encloses the yolk, food for the growing embryo. The amnion encloses the
embryo in protective amniotic fluid. The chorion lies under the shell and
allows for the diffusion of respiratory gases between the outside and the
growing embryo. The allantois is analogous to the placenta in mammals.
It is a conduit for respiratory gases between the environment and the
embryo. It is also the repository for uric acid, the nitrogenous waste from
the embryo that accumulates until the chick hatches. See Figure 18.9.
