 by chief cells of the parathyroid. PTH and calcitonin work in
opposition to one another to maintain homeostatic Ca2+ levels in body fluids. Another type of cells, oxyphil cells, exist
in the parathyroid but their function is not known. These hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell
formation in children and women.
Adrenal Glands
The adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in Figure
28.18. The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete different
hormones.

Adrenal Cortex
The adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks. These layers form three
distinct regions: an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids, a middle zona fasciculata that produces
glucocorticoids, and an in
