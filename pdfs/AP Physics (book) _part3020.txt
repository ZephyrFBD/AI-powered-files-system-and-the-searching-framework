tic wave of frequency f should set electrons into oscillation at frequency f;
and such oscillating electrons would reemit EM waves of this same frequency f
(Section 22–2), which would not change with angle 
Hence the Compton
effect adds to the firm experimental foundation for the photon theory of light.
EXERCISE D When a photon scatters off an electron by the Compton effect, which of
the following increases: its energy, frequency, wavelength?
X-ray scattering. X-rays of wavelength 0.140 nm are
scattered from a very thin slice of carbon. What will be the wavelengths of X-rays
scattered at (a) 0°, (b) 90°, (c) 180°?
APPROACH This is an example of the Compton effect, and we use Eq. 27–7 to
find the wavelengths.
SOLUTION (a) For 
and 
Then Eq. 27–7
gives 
This makes sense since for 
there really isn’t
any collision as the photon goes straight through without interacting.
(b) For
and
So
that is, the wavelength is longer by one Compton wavelength 
for an electron).
(c) For
which means the ph
