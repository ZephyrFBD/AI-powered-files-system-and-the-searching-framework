ction. There is no contradiction, however, because the relationship between ∆H and 
qP has special limitations that only P–V work is involved and that the pressure is constant.

 Magnitude of work = F * ∆h = P * A * ∆h 
 = P * ∆V
Because the system (the conﬁned gas) does work on the 
surroundings, the work is a negative quantity:
 
w = -P∆V 
[5.11]
Now, if P–V work is the only work that can be done, we 
can substitute Equation 5.11 into Equation 5.4 to give
 
∆E = q + w = q - P∆V 
[5.12]
When a reaction is carried out in a constant-volume container 
1∆V = 02, the heat transferred equals the change in internal 
energy:
∆E = q - P∆V = q - P102 = qV 
1constant volume2  
[5.13]
The subscript V indicates that the volume is constant.
Most reactions are run under constant pressure, so that 
Equation 5.12 becomes
 ∆E = qP - P∆V
 
 qP = ∆E + P∆V 1constant pressure2 
[5.14]
We see from Equation 5.8 that the right side of Equation 5.14 
is the enthalpy change under constant-pressure cond
