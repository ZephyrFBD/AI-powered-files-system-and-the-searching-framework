 are attracted to a picnic table or a counter in 
the kitchen, what attracts them? Are they attracted to the capers in a salad or the fruit 
on the counter? Are the fruit flies attracted more to light than to the picnic items? The 
substances to which fruit flies are attracted, such as capers or mustard, typically share 
one ingredient, vinegar. However, it is important NOT to tell students about vinegar 
or alcohol before they complete the lab. The investigation will allow them to discover a 
pattern in fruit fly behavior, so help them look for patterns in the data that they collect 
using the choice chambers. Which of the three responses — geotaxis, chemotaxis, or 
phototaxis — is the strongest for the flies that the students are using? 
Although some activities in this investigation are open inquiry, the components in the 
beginning are structured inquiry, allowing for students to learn and practice key skills 
before they move on to more independent research. In structured inquiry,
