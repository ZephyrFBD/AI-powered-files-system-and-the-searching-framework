-constant expression. 
Substituting the equilibrium partial pressures of the other species 
into the equilibrium-constant expression for the reaction gives:
 
Multiplying through by the denominator gives a quadratic 
equation in x:
x2  = 114.1218.81 - x2
x2 + 14.1x - 124.22  = 0
Solving this equation for x using the quadratic formula 
yields x = 6.14 atm. Hence, the equilibrium partial pres-
sures are P
CO = x = 6.14 atm, P
H2 = x = 6.14 atm, and 
P
H2O = 18.81 - x2 = 2.67 atm.
(b) Part (a) shows that x = 6.14 atm of H2O must react for the sys-
tem to achieve equilibrium. We can use the ideal-gas equation to 
convert this partial pressure into a mole amount.

Thus, 0.0697 mol of H2O and the same amount of C must react 
to achieve equilibrium. As a result, there must be at least 0.0697 
mol of C (0.836 g C) present among the reactants at the start of 
the reaction.
