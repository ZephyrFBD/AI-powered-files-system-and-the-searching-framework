1. C
Learning Objective: 13.1
In chloroplasts, as electrons move through the electron transport
chain, protons are pumped from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen,
creating a proton gradient and producing NADPH. Protons flow down
this gradient back out into the stroma through an ATP synthase to
produce ATP. (C) correctly illustrates this process. (A) is incorrect
because the flow of
