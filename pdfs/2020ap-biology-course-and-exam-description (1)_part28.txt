Practices
The table that follows presents the science practices that students should 
develop during the AP Biology course. These practices form the basis of many 
tasks on the AP Biology Exam.
The unit guides that follow embed and spiral these practices throughout the 
course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the practices into the course 
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills when 
taking the AP Biology Exam.
More detailed information about the teaching of the science practices can be 
found in the Instructional Approaches section of this publication.
