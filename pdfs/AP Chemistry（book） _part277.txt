trons. Thus, carbon has 
atomic number 6, and oxygen has atomic number 8. The atomic number of each element 
is listed with the name and symbol of the element on the front inside cover of the text.
Atoms of a given element can differ in the number of neutrons they contain and, 
consequently, in mass. For example, while most atoms of carbon have six neutrons, some 
have more and some have less. The symbol 12
6C (read “carbon twelve,” carbon-12) rep-
resents the carbon atom containing six protons and six neutrons, whereas carbon atoms 
that contain six protons and eight neutrons have mass number 14, are represented as 14
6C 
and are referred to as carbon-14.
