fast-moving electrons are rapidly decelerated upon striking a metal target. Even
the visible light emitted by an ordinary incandescent bulb is due to electrons
undergoing acceleration within the hot filament.
EXERCISE B Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 625, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Electromagnetic spectrum.
We will meet various types of EM waves later. However, it is worth mentioning
here that infrared (IR) radiation (EM waves whose frequency is just less than that
of visible light) is mainly responsible for the heating e
