that the power P of the combination of two lenses is the
sum of their separate powers,
*88. Two converging lenses are placed 30.0 cm apart. The focal
length of the lens on the right is 20.0 cm, and the focal length
of the lens on the left is 15.0 cm. An object is placed to the
left of the 15.0-cm-focal-length lens. A final image from
both lenses is inverted and located halfway between the
two lenses. How far to the left of the 15.0-cm-focal-length
lens is the original object?
*89. An object is placed 30.0 cm from a
lens. A spher-
ical mirror with focal length 25 cm is placed 75 cm 
behind the lens. Where is the final image? (Note that the
mirror reflects light back through the lens.) Be sure to
draw a diagram.
*90. A small object is 25.0 cm from a diverging lens as shown 
in Fig. 23â€“68. A converging lens with a focal length of
12.0 cm is 30.0 cm to the right of the diverging lens. The
two-lens system forms a real
