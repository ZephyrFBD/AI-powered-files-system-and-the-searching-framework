ostly on moist surfaces. The various types of prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different
metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a
glue-like sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix.
The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. A hydrothermal
vent is a breakage or fissure in the Earth’s surface that releases geothermally heated water. With the evolution of
photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy
source—sunlight—whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food.

in a region known as the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” The mat helps retain microbi
