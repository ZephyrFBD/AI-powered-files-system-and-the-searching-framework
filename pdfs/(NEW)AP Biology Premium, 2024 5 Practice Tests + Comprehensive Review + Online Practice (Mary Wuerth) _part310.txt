13. In pea plants, tall plant height is dominant over short. A new type of plant food (Supersize Food) is advertised
to increase plant height. Two pea plants that are heterozygous for plant height are crossed, and the seeds that
are produced are harvested. Half of the seeds are planted and grown in the presence of Supersize Food, and the
other half of the seeds are planted and grown without Supersize Food. When the plants reach full maturity, the
number of tall and short plants are recorded. The data are shown in the table.
