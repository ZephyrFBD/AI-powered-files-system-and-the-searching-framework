Figure 16.2 Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm, and regulation occurs at
the transcriptional level. Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during transcription and RNA processing, which take
place in the nucleus, and during protein translation, which takes place in the cytoplasm. Further regulation may occur
through post-translational modifications of proteins.
The differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in Table 16.1.
The regulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules.
