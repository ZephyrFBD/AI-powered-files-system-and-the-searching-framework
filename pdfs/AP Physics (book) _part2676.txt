isible part of the 
spectrum, such as in the UV and IR regions. Glass absorbs light in these regions, so
reflection gratings and mirrors (in place of lenses) are used. Special types of film
or sensors are used for detection.
Hydrogen spectrum. Light emitted by hot hydrogen gas is
observed with a spectroscope using a diffraction grating having 
The spectral lines nearest to the center (0°) are a violet line at 24.2°, a blue line
at 25.7°, a blue-green line at 29.1°, and a red line at 41.0° from the center. What
are the wavelengths of these spectral lines of hydrogen?
APPROACH We get the wavelengths from the angles by using
where d is the spacing between slits, and m is the order of the spectrum (Eq.24–4).
SOLUTION Since these are the closest lines to 
this is the first-order 
spectrum 
The slit spacing is
The wavelength of the violet line is
The other wavelengths are:
blue:
blue-green:
red:
NOTE In an unknown mixture of gases, these four spectral lines need to be
seen to identify that t
