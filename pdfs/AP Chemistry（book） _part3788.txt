[23.92]  Metallic elements are essential components of many 
important enzymes operating within our bodies. Car-
bonic anhydrase, which contains Zn2+ in its active site, is 
responsible for rapidly interconverting dissolved CO2 and 
bicarbonate ion, HCO3
-. The zinc in carbonic anhydrase 
is tetrahedrally coordinated by three neutral nitrogen- 
containing groups and a water molecule. The coordinated 
water molecule has a pKa of 7.5, which is crucial for the 
enzyme’s activity. (a) Draw the active site geometry for 
the Zn(II) center in carbonic anhydrase, just writing “N” 
for the three neutral nitrogen ligands from the protein. 
(b) Compare the pKa of carbonic anhydrase’s active site 
with that of pure water; which species is more acidic? 
 
(c) When the coordinated water to the Zn(II) center in car-
bonic anhydrase is deprotonated, what ligands are bound 
to the Zn(II) center? Assume the three nitr
