ments of molecules (as does any kind of diffusion). Rather, active transport moves specific solutes across a
membrane from lower to higher concentrations (opposite direction of diffusion). The term “active” in active
transport implies the use of energy, whereas the various processes of diffusion are passive.
Vesicular transport uses vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm to move macromolecules or large particles
across the plasma membrane. Types of vesicular transport are described here:
Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the
outside of the cell. This is common when a cell produces substances for export.
Endocytosis describes the capture of a substance outside the cell when the plasma membrane merges to engulf it.
The substance subsequently enters the cytoplasm enclosed in a vesicle. There are three kinds of endocytosis.
• Phagocytosis (“cellular eating”) occurs when undissolved material enters the cell. The p
