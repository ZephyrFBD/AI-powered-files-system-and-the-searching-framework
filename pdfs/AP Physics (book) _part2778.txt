eter, measured by
photographing a standard set of parallel black lines on a white background
(sometimes said as “line pairs mm”) on fine-grain film or high quality sensor, or
as so many dots per inch (dpi). The minimum spacing of distinguishable lines or
dots gives the resolution. A lens that can give 
is reasonable,
is very good (
). Electronic sensors also
have a resolution and it is sometimes given as line pairs across the full sensor width.
A “full” Bayer pixel (upper left in Fig. 25–2) is 4 regular pixels: for example,
to make a white dot as part of a white line (between two black lines when deter-
mining lens resolution), all 4 Bayer pixels (RGGB) would have to be bright. For
a Foveon, all three colors of one pixel need to be bright to produce a white dot.†
Pixels and resolution. A digital camera offers a maximum

sensor. How sharp should
the lens be to make use of this sensor resolution in RAW?
