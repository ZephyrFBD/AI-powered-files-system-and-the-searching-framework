king A method of stiffening polymers by introducing 
chemical bonds between chains. (Section 12.8)
crystal-field theory A theory that accounts for the colors and the 
magnetic and other properties of transition-metal complexes in 
terms of the splitting of the energies of metal ion d orbitals by 
the electrostatic interaction with the ligands. (Section 23.6)
crystal lattice The geometrical pattern of points on which the 
unit cells are arranged; in effect, an abstract (that is, not real) 
scaffolding for the crystal structure. (Section 12.2)
crystalline solid (crystal) A solid whose internal arrangement of 
atoms, molecules, or ions possesses a regularly repeating pattern 
in any direction through the solid. (Section 12.2)
crystallinity A measure of the extent of short-range ordering in a 
polymer where chains line up in regular arrays. (Section 12.8)
crystallization The process in which molecules, ions, or atoms 
come together to form a crystalline solid. The opposite of the 
solution
