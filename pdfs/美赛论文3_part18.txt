es from
half an hour to one and a half hour. Due to the change of the water temperature
and the reality, we can roughly deduce that the times of adding hot water into the
bathtub range from 1 to 4.

Due to thermodynamic principles, the time that the even hot water takes to
become cool is very long, so it is much longer than the ‘even time’ we have set
before. Therefore, the lost heat during the ‘even time’ can be ignored. That is to
say, heat only gets lost during the stage of becoming cool.

Considering about adding hot water into the bathtub and draining away cold
water from the bathtub, because the water is flowing from the single faucet to the
bathtub almost in the shape of column, a block of water below the single faucet is
in the shape of column and keeps the temperature. The hot water drops into the
cold water with high energy, so the height of the block of water is very close to
the height of the bathtub, which is shown in the picture below. What is clear is
