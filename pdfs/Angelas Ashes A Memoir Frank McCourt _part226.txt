e and you’d think he’d know why I’m sitting 
 
 there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he 
 
 said, Och, now, Francis, you’re a bit of a dreamer. 
 
 I get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother.The 
 
 poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel. 
 
 He laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn’t it curious 
 
 the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child. 
 
 Before Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than 
 
 Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with 
 
 the damp, and the kitchen isn’t a lake anymore, and if we’re up early 
 
 we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen 
 
 window. 
 
 In fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have 
 
 them, looking at the world and watching us play.Women stand with 
 
  
  
 their arms folded, chatting.They don’t sit because all they do is stay at 
 
 home, take care
