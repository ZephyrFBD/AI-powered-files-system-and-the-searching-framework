Questions 13–16
Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as shown in the following reaction:
A student isolates catalase from potato tissue and places it on ice. The student uses a hole punch to make equally
sized paper disks, saturates each disk in the catalase solution, and then places them in beakers with different
concentrations of H2O2. As the enzyme-catalyzed reaction proceeds, oxygen bubbles are produced and they cling to
the paper disks, which then float to the surface. The time required for the catalase-saturated filter paper to float is
recorded. The experiment is repeated five times for each concentration of hydrogen peroxide. The data are shown in
the table.
