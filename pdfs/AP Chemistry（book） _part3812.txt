The following steps summarize the procedures used to name alkanes, which all have 
names ending with -ane. We use a similar approach to write the names of other organic 
compounds.
How to Name Alkanes
 
1. Find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms, and use the name of 
this chain (given in Table 24.2) as the base name. Be careful in this step because 
the longest chain may not be written in a straight line, as in the following structure:
CH
CH3
CH3
CH3
CH2
CH2
CH2
1
2
3
4
5
6
2-Methylhexane
 
 Because the longest continuous chain contains six C atoms, this isomer is named 
as a substituted hexane. Groups attached to the main chain are called substituents 
because they are substituted in place of an H atom on the main chain. In this mol-
ecule, the CH3 group not enclosed by the blue outline is the only substituent in the 
molecule.
 
2. Number the carbon atoms
