r lactic acid fermentation. Anaerobic respiration originated billions of
years ago when there was no free oxygen in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Even
today it is the sole means by which anaerobic bacteria such as botulinum
(the bacterium that causes a form of food poisoning, botulism) release
energy from food. There are two types of anaerobes: facultative and
obligate. Facultative anaerobes can tolerate the presence of oxygen; they
simply do not use it. Obligate anaerobes cannot live in an environment
containing oxygen.
Fermentation can generate ATP during anaerobic respiration only as
long as there is an adequate supply of NAD+ to accept electrons during
glycolysis. Without some mechanism to convert NADH back to NAD+,
glycolysis would shut down. Fermentation consists of glycolysis plus the
reactions that regenerate NAD+. Two types of fermentation are alcohol
fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.
