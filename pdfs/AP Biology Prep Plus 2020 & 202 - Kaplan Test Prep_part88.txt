and the accumulation of energy needed to drive reactions for producing
simple organic molecules.
The prevailing theory of the origin of life, sometimes known as the
“organic soup” model, is that these organic molecules became more and
more complex until amino acids and nucleic acids were formed. Once

strings of nucleic acids formed, they could self-replicate within the
“soup.” These self-replicating structures organized into protobionts,
which were droplets of segregated chemicals. Chemicals continued to
organize until the first identifiable cells, the first unicellular organisms,
came into being.
Of course, there are points of dispute concerning the details of this
process, such as whether the initial reactions that produced organic
molecules actually occurred in solution, as proposed by the organic soup
model, or on solid reactive surfaces, such as clay particles. There is also
uncertainty over whet
