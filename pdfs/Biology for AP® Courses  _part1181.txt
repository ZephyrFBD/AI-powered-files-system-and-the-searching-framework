subunit of chromatin composed of a short length of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins
mutated version of a normal gene involved in the positive regulation of the cell cycle
(also, ORI) region of the prokaryotic chromosome where replication begins (origin of replication)
cell cycle regulatory protein that inhibits the cell cycle; its levels are controlled by p53
cell cycle regulatory protein that regulates cell growth and monitors DNA damage; it halts the progression of the cell
cycle in cases of DNA damage and may induce apoptosis
stage of mitosis during which the nuclear membrane breaks down and mitotic spindle fibers attach to
kinetochores
stage of mitosis during which chromosomes condense and the mitotic spindle begins to form
normal gene that when mutated becomes an oncogene
