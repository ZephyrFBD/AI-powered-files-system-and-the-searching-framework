which it loses electrons. Alternatively, one could measure

CHAPTER 7 Periodic Properties of the Elements
how well electricity is conducted by each of the elements to 
determine how “metallic” the elements are. On the basis of 
conductivity, there is not much of a trend in the periodic ta-
ble: Silver is the most conductive metal, and manganese the 
least. Look up the ﬁrst ionization energies of silver and man-
ganese; which of these two elements would you call more 
metallic based on the way we deﬁne it in this book?
 7.102  Which of the following is the expected product of the re-
action of K(s) and H21g2? (i) KH(s), (ii) K2H1s2, (iii) KH21s2,  
(iv) K2H21s2, or (v) K(s) and H21g2 will not react with one an-
other.
 7.103  Elemental cesium reacts more violently with water than does 
elemental sodium. Which of the following best explains this 
difference in reactivity? (i) Sodium
