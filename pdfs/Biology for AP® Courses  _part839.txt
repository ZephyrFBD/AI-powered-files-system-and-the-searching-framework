In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2. If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be
produced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2 to the electron transport chain. If aerobic
respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for r
