a nucleus. The stable nuclei (dark blue dots) define a region known as the belt of stability.
ratio of nearby nuclei that lie within the belt of stability. We can envision three general 
situations, which are labeled 1, 2, and 3, in Figure 21.1.
1. Nuclei above the belt of stability (high neutron-to-proton ratios). These 
neutron-rich nuclei can lower their ratio and thereby move toward the belt of stabil-
ity by emitting a beta particle because beta emission decreases the number of neu-
trons and increases the number of protons (Equation 21.3).
2. Nuclei below the belt of stability (low neutron-to-proton ratios). These 
proton-rich nuclei can increase their ratio and so move closer to the belt of stabil-
ity by eithe
