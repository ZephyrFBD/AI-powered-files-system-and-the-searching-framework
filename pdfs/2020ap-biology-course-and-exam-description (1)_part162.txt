ssorted to gametes and daughter cells; 
thus, traits determined by chloroplast and 
mitochondrial DNA do not follow simple 
Mendelian rules.
b.	In animals, mitochondria are transmitted by 
the egg and not by sperm; as such, traits 
determined by the mitochondrial DNA are 
maternally inherited.
c.	In plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts 
are transmitted in the ovule and not in the 
pollen; as such, mitochondria-determined 
and chloroplast-determined traits are 
maternally inherited.
