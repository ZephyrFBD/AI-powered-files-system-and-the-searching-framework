80. A motor run by a 9.0-V battery has a 20-turn square coil
with sides of length 5.0 cm and total resistance 
When
spinning, the magnetic field felt by the wire in the coil is
0.020 T. What is the maximum torque on the motor?
81. Electrons are accelerated horizontally by 2.2 kV. They then
pass through a uniform magnetic field B for a distance of
3.8 cm, which deflects them upward so they reach the top
of a screen 22 cm away, 11 cm above the center. Estimate
the value of B.
82. A 175-g model airplane charged to 18.0 mC and traveling
at 
passes within 8.6 cm of a wire, nearly parallel to
its path, carrying a 25-A current. What acceleration (in g’s)
does this interaction give the airplane?

a fulcrum, w
