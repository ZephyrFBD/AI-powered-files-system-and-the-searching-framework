via buoyancy, just as a log submerged in water floats upward because its density
is less than that of water. Warm or cold ocean currents, such as the balmy Gulf
Stream, represent natural convection on a global scale. Wind is another example of
convection, and weather in general is strongly influenced by convective air currents.
When a pot of water is heated (Fig. 14–8), convection currents are set up as
the heated water at the bottom of the pot rises because of its reduced density.
That heated water is replaced by cooler water from above. This principle is used
in many heating systems, such as the hot-water radiator system shown in Fig. 14–9.
Water is heated in the furnace, and as its temperature increases, it expands and
rises as shown. This causes the water to circulate in the heating system. Hot
water then enters the radiators, heat is transferred by conduction to the air, and
the cooled water returns to the furnace. Thus, the water circulates because of
convection; pumps are somet
