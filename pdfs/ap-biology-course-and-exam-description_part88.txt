ral 
features of a cell that allow 
organisms to capture, store, 
and use energy.
SYI-1.F
SYI-1.F.3
The thylakoids are organized in stacks, 
called grana.
SYI-1.F.4
Membranes contain chlorophyll pigments and 
electron transport proteins that comprise the 
photosystems. 
SYI-1.F.5
The light-dependent reactions of 
photosynthesis occur in the grana.
SYI-1.F.6
The stroma is the fluid within the inner 
chloroplast membrane and outside of 
the thylakoid. 
SYI-1.F.7
The carbon fixation (Calvin-Benson cycle) 
reactions of photosynthesis occur in 
the stroma. 
SYI-1.F.8
The Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) reactions 
occur in the matrix of the mitochondria. 
SYI-1.F.9
Electron transport and ATP synthesis occur on 
the inner mitochondrial membrane.
