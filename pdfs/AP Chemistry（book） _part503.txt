1021 hydrogen atoms. (a) How many 
 
atoms of carbon does it contain? (b) How many molecules of 
 
testosterone does it contain? (c) How many moles of testosterone 
does it contain? (d) What is the mass of this sample in grams?
 3.43 The allowable concentration level of vinyl chloride, C2H3Cl, 
in the atmosphere in a chemical plant is 2.0 * 10-6 g>L. 
How many moles of vinyl chloride in each liter does this rep-
resent? How many molecules per liter?
 3.44 At least 25 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active 
 
ingredient in marijuana, is required to produce intoxi-
cation. The molecular formula of THC is C21H30O2. How 
many moles of THC does this 25 mg represent? How many 
molecules?
Empirical Formulas from Analyses (Section 3.5)
 3.45 Give the empirical formula of each of the following com-
pounds if a sample contains (a) 0.0130 mol C, 0.0390 mol 
H, and 0.0065 mol O; (b) 11.66 g iron and 5.01 g oxygen; 
 
(c) 40.0% C, 6.7% H, and 53.3% O by mass.
