hes the expected value based on 
the number of ions in the formula unit. Thus, we conclude that the 
extent of ion pairing in electrolyte solutions decreases upon dilu-
tion. Second, the lower the charges on the ions, the less i departs 
from the expected value because the extent of ion pairing decreases 
as the ionic charges decrease. Both trends are consistent with sim-
ple electrostatics: The force of interaction between charged particles 
decreases as their separation increases and as their charges decrease.
