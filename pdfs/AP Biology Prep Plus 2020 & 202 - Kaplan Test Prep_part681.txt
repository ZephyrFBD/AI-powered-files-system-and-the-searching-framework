ssociated genotypes), acting as a force that
decreases variation within a population. Selection eﬀectively acts as a
filter on the gene pool: organisms with phenotypes that allow them to
survive and produce fertile oﬀspring within their specific environmental
niche pass through the filter successfully, while unfit organisms that are
not well adapted to their environment are filtered out. This process of
filtering is generally known as natural selection, a theory established by
Darwin and discussed in chapter 4.
In addition to natural selection, Darwin also put forth a theory of sexual
selection (in his 1871 book, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation
to Sex). Sexual selection has specifically to do with selective pressures
that impact the capacity for successful reproduction. Many male birds
have bright mating plumage that makes them conspicuous in a forest
and more prone to attack from predators. Male ungulates oȇen have
huge antlers that grow every year and make it more diﬀic
