 eﬀective way to test
the hypothesis. (A) is incorrect because early cells would not secrete
much of the signal molecule into the supernatant. (C) and (D) are
incorrect because a fresh medium would not contain the signaling
molecule.

According to the lower right image in the diagram, only dimers bound
to ligands carry enough phosphate groups to be activated fully. (C) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect because full phosphorylation occurs only
when the ligand is bound to the dimer. (B) is incorrect because the
dimer without the ligand can be partially phosphorylated, as is clear
from the image on the upper right. (D) is incorrect because the
monomers cannot be phosphorylated and because the signaling
cascade will not be initiated without a signal.

The question stem states that the cholera toxin locks a G-protein into
being bound to GTP. According to the top image in the diagram, the G-
protein subunits cannot reform until GTP has
