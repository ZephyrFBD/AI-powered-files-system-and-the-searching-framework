 gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes a required step in the biosynthesis 
of ascorbic acid. Most mammals carry a functional copy of the GULO gene, but some primates carry only a GULO 
 
pseudogene, which is a nonfunctional variant. 
A comparison of GULO genes and GULO pseudogenes from different animals can provide insight into the 
evolutionary relatedness of the animals. In Table I, selected members of some mammalian groups are listed, along 
with an indication of their ability to synthesize ascorbic acid. Table II shows an alignment of amino acid coding 
sequences from homologous regions of the GULO genes and GULO pseudogenes of the organisms listed in Table I. 
Figure 1 represents the universal genetic code.
