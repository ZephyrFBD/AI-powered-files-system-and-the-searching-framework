 con-
centrations of acid and base to calculate pH 
directly:
 
pH = pKa + log
3base4
3acid4 = 3.85 + loga 0.10
0.12 b
 = 3.85 + 1-0.082 = 3.77
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
If the pH of a buffer solution is equal to the pKa of the acid 
in the buffer, what does this tell you about the relative con-
centrations of the acid and conjugate base forms of the buffer 
components?
(a) The acid concentration must be zero. (b) The base concen-
tration must be zero. (c) The acid and base concentrations must 
be equal. (d) The acid and base concentrations must be equal to 
the Ka. (e) The base concentration must be 2.3 times as large as 
the acid concentration.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Calculate the pH of a buffer composed of 0.12 M benzoic acid 
and 0.20 M sodium benzoate. (Refer to Appendix D.)
Calculate the pH of a buffer that initially contains 1.00 * 10-3 M  CH3COOH and 1.00 * 10-4 M  CH3COONa in the  
following two ways: (i) using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation and (ii) making no assumptions abo
