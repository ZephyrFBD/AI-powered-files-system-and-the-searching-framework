ack one trait through a population’s life cycle?  
•  Can you describe an idealized life cycle that would work the best for keeping track  
of a genetic trait in a population?  
Help the students arrive at the simplifying assumptions and modeling solutions.

■ Skills Development 
From a biology standpoint, students should carry out this investigation after they 
have studied Mendelian genetics, perhaps just as they start studying evolution. They 
should have a good handle on the differences between genes and alleles. Traditional 
Hardy-Weinberg activities, such as those in Lab 8 of the AP Biology Lab Manual (2001) 
and exercises like the “M&M” lab (http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/bi/1994/
hwintro.html
 
), provide a useful transition for students as they enter into computer-
based models. Students should also be familiar with Excel and spreadsheet operations. 
■ Potential Challenges 
Students’ and teachers’ unfamiliarity with spreadsheet operations is a major
