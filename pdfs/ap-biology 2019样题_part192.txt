Construct an Argument 
Students can perform a brine shrimp lab, placing groups of brine shrimp eggs in petri 
dishes with various concentrations of salt in the water. They monitor the number of eggs 
and swimming shrimp in the petri dishes at regular time intervals over a period of two to 
three days. Students can calculate the hatching viability in each petri dish and then graph 
their data. Chi-square can be used to analyze the null hypothesis.

population.

Ask the Expert 
Show students a cartoon of an isolating mechanism that leads to speciation. Discuss 
with students what is happening in this cartoon and how it relates to speciation. Students 
should do research on other isolating mechanisms and draw their own cartoon to illustrate 
their learnings.
