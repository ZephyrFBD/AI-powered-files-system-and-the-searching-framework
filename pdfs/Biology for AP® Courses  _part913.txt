oxidizing atmosphere early in Earth’s history—today they are interdependent. As we studied in Cellular Respiration, aerobic
cellular respiration taps into the oxidizing ability of oxygen to synthesize the organic compounds that are used to power
cellular processes.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big
Idea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table. The learning objectives listed
in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory
experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more
of the seven science practices.
