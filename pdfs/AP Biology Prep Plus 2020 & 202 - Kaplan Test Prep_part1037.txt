The most reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the figure is that glucagon and
insulin act antagonistically. Most processes in the figure that are stimulated by insulin are
inhibited by glucagon (and vice versa). (B) is thus correct. (A) is untrue and not a
reasonable conclusion that may be drawn from the figure. (C) and (D) are both true
statements, but neither can be concluded from the data in the figure.
23. C
Insulin lowers plasma glucose levels. Plasma glucose inhibits glucagon. An inability to
synthesize insulin would lead to increased plasma glucose levels and decreased
glucagon levels, as in (C).
24. C
In resting individuals, both carbohydrates and fats are utilized for energy, so the RQ
would be expected to be somewhere between the RQ for carbohydrates and the RQ for
lipids. (C) is thus correct.
25. A
Organisms at the top of the food chain generally have the least biomass, while organisms
at the bottom have the greatest biomass. In this
