e data analyses as you prepare and study 
your discussion and conclusions. In particular for this investigation, you should 
somehow indicate the variability in your data. The ET50 measurement is calculated 
from the median. To indicate the spread of your data, you could use error bars 
around the ET50 point that express that variation, or you might consider using “box 
and whisker” plots.

CELLULAR RESPIRATION*
What factors affect the rate of cellular respiration in multicellular 
organisms?
 
■BACKGROUND
Living systems require free energy and matter to maintain order, to grow, and to 
reproduce. Energy deficiencies are not only detrimental to individual organisms, but 
they cause disruptions at the population and ecosystem levels as well. Organisms employ 
various strategies that have been conserved through evolution to capture, use, and store 
free energy. Autotrophic organisms capture fre
