 related compound guanine
(guano) instead of urea. Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. Uric acid is a compound
similar to purines found in nucleic acids. It is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted
by birds, insects, and reptiles. Conversion of ammonia to uric acid requires more energy and is much more complex than
conversion of ammonia to urea Figure 32.14.
Figure 32.14 Nitrogenous waste is excreted in different forms by different species. These include (a) ammonia, (b)
urea, and (c) uric acid. (credit a: modification of work by Eric Engbretson, USFWS; credit b: modification of work by B.

Gout
Mammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells. However, too much uric acid tends to form
kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout, where uric acid crystals accumulate in the
joints, as illustrated in Figure 32.
