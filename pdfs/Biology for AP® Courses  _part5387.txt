broken every tyranny in history. By its very nature self-respect will
not bow to oppression and its perpetrators. There is so liĴle self-

Crazy, contradictory, ever-changing ‘Covid’ rules are systematically
applied by psychologists to delete self-respect. They want you to see

makes no sense, and yet you still do it. Your self-respect is
extinguished and this has been happening as ever more obviously
stupid and nonsensical things hav
