In Figure 22.32(c), each silicate tetrahedron is linked to three others, forming an 
infinite sheet structure. Each silicon in this structure has one unshared oxygen and three 
shared oxygens. The stoichiometry is then 1112 +31½2 = 2 
½ oxygens per silicon. The 
simplest formula of this sheet is Si2O5
2 -. The mineral talc, also known as talcum powder, 
has the formula Mg31Si2O5221OH22 and is based on this sheet structure. The Mg2 +  and 
OH -  ions lie between the silicate sheets. The slippery feel of talcum powder is due to the 
silicate sheets sliding relative to one another.
Asbestos is a general term applied to a group of fibrous silicate minerals. The struc-
ture of these minerals is either chains of silicate tetrahedra or sheets formed into rolls. 
The result is that the minerals have a fibrous character (Figure 22.33). Asbestos miner-
als were once widely used as thermal insulation, especially in high-temperature appli-
cations, because of the great chemical stab
