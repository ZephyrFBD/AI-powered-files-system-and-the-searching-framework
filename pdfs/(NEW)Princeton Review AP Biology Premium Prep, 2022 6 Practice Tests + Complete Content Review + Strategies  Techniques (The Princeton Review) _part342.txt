ng regions and noncoding regions. The regions that express the code that will be turned into protein are exons.
The noncoding regions in the mRNA are introns.
The introns—the intervening sequences—must be removed before the mRNA leaves the nucleus. This process,
called splicing, is accomplished by an RNA-protein complex called a spliceosome. This process produces a final
mRNA that is shorter than the transcribed RNA. The way that a transcript is spliced can vary, and alternative
splicing variants will result with different exons included.
In addition to splicing, a poly(A) tail is added to the 3’ end and a 5’ GTP cap is added to the 5’ end.
Translation
Translation is the process of turning an mRNA into a protein. Remember, each protein is made of amino acids. The
order of the mRNA nucleotides will be read in the ribosome in groups of three. Three nucleotides is called a codon.
Each codon corresponds to a particular amino acid. The genetic code is redundant, meaning that certain amino a
