series of processes pertaining to different
components of each neuron. What happens at the axon
terminals to facilitate signal transmission to another
neuron?
a.
Chemicals released at the axon terminals
transmit signals through synapses into other
neurons via the second neuron’s dendrites.
b.
Chemicals released at the axon terminals
transmit signals through synapses into other
neurons via the second neuron’s axons.
c.
Chemicals released at the dendrites transmit
signals through synapses into other neurons via
the second neuron’s axon terminal.
d.
Chemicals released at the axon terminals
transmit signals directly into other neurons via
the second neuron’s axons.
18. This figure shows a malformed neuron. Why would
this neuron be nonfunctional?
a.
This neuron would not be able to receive signals.
b.
This neuron would not be able to recharge the
signal.
c.
This neuron would not be able to integrate
information from numerous synapses.
d.
This neuron would not be able to send signals.
