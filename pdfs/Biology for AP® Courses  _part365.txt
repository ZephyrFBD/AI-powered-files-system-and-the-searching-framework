a.
Electrons are added to OH and H ion in the
dehydration synthesis. They are removed from
OH and H in hydrolysis.
b.
Electrons are transferred from OH and H ions
to the monomers in dehydration synthesis. They
are taken up by the H and OH ions from the
monomers in hydrolysis.
c.
Electrons are removed from OH and H in the
dehydration synthesis. They are added to OH
and H in hydrolysis.
d.
Electrons are transferred from monomers to H
and OH ions in hydrolysis and from OH and
H to monomers in dehydration synthesis.
