essure in the arm cuff which can be read off the gauge.
The air pressure is subsequently reduced further, and the tapping sound disappears
when blood at low pressure can enter the artery. At this point, the gauge indicates
the diastolic pressure. Normal systolic pressure is around 120 mm-Hg, whereas
normal diastolic pressure is around 70 or 80 mm-Hg. Blood pressure is reported
in the form 120 70.

The three common phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.
Liquids and gases are collectively called fluids, meaning they
have the ability to flow. The density of a material is defined as
its mass per unit volume:
(10;1)
Specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of the material to
the density of water (at 4°C).
Pressure is defined as force per unit area:
(10;2)
The pressure P at a depth h in a liquid of constant density , due
to the weight of the liquid, is given by
