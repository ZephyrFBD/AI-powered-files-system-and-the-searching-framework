e space to increase or decrease? What effect would cyanide have on ATP
synthesis?
a.
The proton concentration of the intermembrane space would decrease, stopping the production of ATP.
b.
The proton concentration of the intermembrane space would increase, leading to ATP formation.
c.
The hydrogen ion concentration of the intermembrane space would decrease, causing a high production of
ATP.
d.
The proton concentration of the intermembrane space would increase, causing production of ATP in large
amounts.
ATP Yield
The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of hydrogen
ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. Another source
of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the mitochondria. (The NADH generated from
glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria.) Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either NAD+
or FAD+. As you
