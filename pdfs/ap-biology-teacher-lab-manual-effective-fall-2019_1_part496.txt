the safety of genetically modified 
foods. 
The techniques required for gene transfer in higher plants and animals are complex, 
costly, and difficult even in the research laboratory. However, the techniques of gene 
transfer in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria are simple and appropriate for the teaching 
and learning laboratory (Rapoza and Kreuzer 2004). One common technology,

bacterial plasmid-based genetic transformation, enables students to manipulate genetic 
information in a laboratory setting to understand more fully how DNA operates. 
In this investigation, students will first acquire the tools to transform E. coli bacteria 
to express new genetic information using a plasmid system and apply mathematical 
routines to determine transformation efficiency. (Competent bacterial cells are able 
to take up exogenous genetic material and are capable of being transformed, and the 
procedure provided is des
