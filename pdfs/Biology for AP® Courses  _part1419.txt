lways inherited together. During meiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.
Homologous Recombination
In 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata—the point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange
segments—prior to the first division of meiosis. He suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically
exchange segments. As chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct
points. Janssen suggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments were exchanged. It
is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes, known as synapsis, does more than

simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells. When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo
reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination, or more simply, “crossing
over.”
