rovide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS. Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect
the brain from invading microorganisms. Oligodendrocytes, shown in Figure 26.8b form myelin sheaths around axons
in the CNS. One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for
multiple neurons. This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the
entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon. Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end
destinations. Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are
involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which serves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal
cord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid plexus.
