idemic area, the curve of susceptible 
rate is similar to the Basic Model, but the curve of infective rate changes a lot. 
Firstly, the maximum of I(t) decrease a lot compared to the Basic Model. The 
reason is that vaccines can firstly deduct the number of susceptible people 
remarkably, then, deduct the number of infected people. The trend of infective 
rate is the same with the previous. It increases at first and then declines, but 
overall, it is smaller. 
3.2.6 Strength and Weakness 
 Strength: This model takes the vaccines into account, so we can use this 
model to analyze the effect of vaccines on the epidemic situation. 
 Weakness:  In this model, μ is still a constant, that is to say, we ignore 
the effect of drugs on the epidemic situation. In fact, when we offer 
patients with medical treatment, the μ will change and that is what we will 
consider in the next improved model.
