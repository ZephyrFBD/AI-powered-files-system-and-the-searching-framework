 the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated
signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication. The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly
a billion years ago, as an essential response to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any
pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection
independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus secretions contain
microbicidal factors.
Physical and Chemical Barriers
Before any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious
pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skinâ€™s acidity. In addition,
beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infectio
