n how these studies provided evidence to
support the Triplet Code.
Khorana (1960) developed a technique for synthesizing
RNA composed of predictable distributions of repeated
pairs or triplets of nucleotides. He found, for example, that
RNA synthesized when A and U were present in relative
concentrations of 4:1, respectively, will produce RNA
sequences with these distributions determined by their
relative probabilities: AAU:AAA, AUA:AAA, and
UAA:AAA; 0.82 Ã— 0.2/0.83 = 1/4 [calculated as follows: i)
4/5 of the bases are A, so the likelihood of selecting A is
0.8; ii) the selection is repeated to determine the second
letter of the three-letter codon; iii) the likelihood of
selecting a U is 1 in 5; iv) the probability of selecting the

set AUU is the product; v) similarly, the probability of
AAA is (4/5)3; and vi) the ratio of these probabilities is
their relative likelihood]
