both alleles.
10. The gene for coat color in some breeds of cats is found on the X chromosome. Calico cats are mottled with
orange and black colorings. What is a possible explanation for the fact that true calico cats are only female?
(A) The allele for coat color is randomly chosen by X-inactivation.
(B) The coat color is linked with genes that are lethal to male cats, so male calico cats never live past birth.
(C) Coat orange and black color is expressed only in female cats; males have only one color.
(D) Male cats have Y chromosomes.
Summary
Genetics is the study of heredity. The foundation of genetics is that traits are produced by genes, which are
found on chromosomes.
Diploid organisms carry two copies of every gene, one on each of two homologous chromosomes, one that
came from their mother and one that came from their father.
When two alleles are the same, the organism is homozygous for that trait. When the two alleles are different, the
organism is heterozygous for the trait.
