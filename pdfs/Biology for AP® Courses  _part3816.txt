later section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products
like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion
happens in the DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by
secreting excess H+ ions.
Although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed
close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between
the different cell types. For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called macula densa,
which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells. Together, the macula densa and
juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC). The JGC is an endocrine structure tha
