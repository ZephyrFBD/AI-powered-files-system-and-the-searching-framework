 in the water, CO2 diffuses into the cells.
 
3. CO2 enters photosynthesizing cells. CO2 enters the palisade
mesophyll, where most photosynthesis occurs. These cells are tightly fitted against the top surface of the leaf (or in
vertically oriented leaves, both surfaces of the leaf) to maximize the amount of photosynthesizing surface area
exposed to sunlight.
4. O2 diffuses into roots from gaseous spaces in soil. To obtain energy
 
from stored carbohydrates, roots need to carry out respiration. For this,
 
they need a supply of O2; this O2 comes from gas-filled pores in the
 
soil.
 
In aquatic plants, there is little risk of water loss from transpiration and stomata usually remain open. In many
aquatic plants whose leaves rest on
the water surface, both CO2and O2enter the leaves through the stomata and pass into air spaces of the spongy
mesophyll. Both CO2and O2are transported throughout the plant through a trail of these air spaces. CO2
