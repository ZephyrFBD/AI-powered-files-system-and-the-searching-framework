72. Use Fig. 30â€“1 to estimate the total binding energy for
copper and then estimate the energy, in joules, needed to
break a 3.0-g copper penny into its constituent nucleons.
73. Instead of giving atomic masses for nuclides as in
Appendix B, some Tables give the mass excess,
defined
as 
where A is the atomic mass number and
M is the mass in u. Determine the mass excess, in u and in
for: (a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) From 
a glance at Appendix B, can you make a generalization
about the sign of 
as a function of Z or A?
74. When water is placed near an intense neutron source, the
neutrons can be slowed down to almost zero speed by col-
lisions with the water molecules, and are eventually
captured by a hydrogen nucleus to form the stable isotope
called deuterium,
giving off a gamma ray. What is the
energy of the gamma ray?
75. The practical limit for carbon-14 dating is about 60,000 years.
If a bone contains 1.0 kg of carbon, and the animal died
