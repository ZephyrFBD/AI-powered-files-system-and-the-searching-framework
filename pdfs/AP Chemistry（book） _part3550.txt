Hydrazine 1N2H42 is another important hydride of nitrogen. The hydrazine mole-
cule contains an N¬N single bond (Figure 22.22). It can be prepared by the reaction of 
ammonia with hypochlorite ion 1OCl -2 in aqueous solution:
 
2 NH31aq2 + OCl -1aq2 ¡ N2H41aq2 + Cl -1aq2 + H2O1l2 
[22.35]
The reaction involves several intermediates, including chloramine 1NH2Cl2. The poi-
sonous NH2Cl bubbles out of solution when household ammonia and chlorine bleach 
(which contains OCl - ) are mixed. This reaction is one reason for the frequently cited 
warning not to mix bleach and household ammonia.
Pure hydrazine is a strong and versatile reducing agent. The major use of hydra-
zine and compounds related to it, such as methylhydrazine (Figure 22.22), is as 
rocket fuel.
