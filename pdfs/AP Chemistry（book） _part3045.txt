 other living system, is positive.
The second law of thermodynamics applies also to the way we 
humans order our surroundings. In addition to being complex liv-
ing systems ourselves, we are masters of producing order in the world 
around us. We manipulate and order matter at the nanoscale level in 
order to produce the technological breakthroughs that have become 
so commonplace in the twenty-ﬁrst century. We use tremendous 
quantities of raw materials to produce highly ordered materials. In 
so doing, we expend a great deal of energy to, in essence, “ﬁght” the 
second law of thermodynamics.
For every bit of order we produce, however, we produce an even 
greater amount of disorder. Petroleum, coal, and natural gas are burned 
to provide the energy necessary for us to achieve highly ordered struc-
tures, but their combustion increases the entropy of the universe by 
releasing CO21g2, H2O1g2, and heat. Thus, even as we strive to create 
more impressive discoveries and greater order in o
