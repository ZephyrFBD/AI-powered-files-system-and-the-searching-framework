with sickle cell
anemia, a life-threatening condition that results from a substitution of one
amino acid (valine) for another (glutamic acid) in a molecule of
hemoglobin.

Explain the connection between the sequence of the subcomponents of a polymer and
its properties. Sickle cell anemia is a good example.
While working in the 1940s and 1950s, Fred Sanger was the first to
sequence a protein. That protein was insulin, and he received the Nobel
Prize for his work.
The secondary structure of a protein results from hydrogen bonding
within the polypeptide molecule. It refers to how the polypeptide coils or
folds into two distinct shapes: an alpha helix or a beta-pleated sheet; see
Figure 2.14.

Figure 2.14 Beta- (β)-pleated sheet
Proteins that exhibit either alpha helix or beta-pleated sheet or both are
called fibrous proteins. Examples of fibrous proteins are wool, claws,
beaks, reptile scales, collagen, and ligaments. The protein th
