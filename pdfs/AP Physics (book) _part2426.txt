85. A certain electronic device needs to be protected against
sudden surges in current. In particular, after the power is
turned on, the current should rise no more than 7.5 mA in
the first 
The device has resistance 
and is
designed to operate at 55 mA. How would you protect this
device?
86. A 35-turn 12.5-cm-diameter coil is placed between the pole
pieces of an electromagnet. When the electromagnet is
turned on, the flux through the coil changes, inducing an
emf. At what rate (in 
) must the magnetic field change
if the emf is to be 120 V?
