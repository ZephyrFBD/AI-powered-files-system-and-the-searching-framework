f the repressor protein to the operator
3. Which sequences in bacterial operons are noncoding sequences?
(A) operators and promoters only
(B) operators, promoters, and genes for regulatory proteins
(C) operators, promoters, and genes for structural proteins
(D) promoters, genes for regulatory proteins, and genes for structural proteins
4. Which of the following is a key difference between inducible operons and repressible operons?
(A) Inducible operons have promoter sequences, and repressible operons do not have promoter sequences.
(B) Inducible operons have operator sequences, and repressible operons do not have operator sequences.
(C) The repressor in an inducible operon can bind to the operator sequence on its own, but the repressor in a
repressible operon requires a corepressor in order to bind to the operator.
(D) In inducible operons, RNA polymerase requires the presence of a corepressor in order to bind to the
promoter; in repressible operons, RNA polymerase does not require a c
