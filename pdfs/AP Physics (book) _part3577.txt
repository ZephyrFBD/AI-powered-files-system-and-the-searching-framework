tells us that the exchanged particle for the electromagnetic force, the
photon, will have zero mass, which it does.
The particle predicted by Yukawa was discovered in cosmic rays by C. F.
Powell and G. Occhialini in 1947, and is called the “ ” or pi meson, or simply the
pion. It comes in three charge states:

close to Yukawa’s prediction. All three interact strongly with matter. Reactions
observed in the laboratory, using a particle accelerator, include
(32;4)
The incident proton from the accelerator must have sufficient energy to produce
the additional mass of the free pion.
Yukawa’s theory of pion exchange as carrier of the strong force has been
superseded by quantum chromodynamics in which protons, neutrons, and other
strongly interacting particles are made up of basic entities called quarks, and the
basic carriers of the strong force are gluons, as we shall discuss shortly. But the
basic idea of the earlier the
