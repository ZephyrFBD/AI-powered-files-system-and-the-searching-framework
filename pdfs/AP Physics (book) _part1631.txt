Carnot Engine
To see how to increase efficiency, the French scientist Sadi Carnot (1796–1832)
examined the characteristics of an ideal engine, now called a Carnot engine. No
Carnot engine actually exists, but as a theoretical idea it played an important role
in the development and understanding of the second law of thermodynamics.

The idealized Carnot engine consisted of four processes done in a cycle, two
of which are adiabatic 
and two are isothermal 
This idealized
cycle is shown in Fig. 15–14. Each of the processes was considered to be done
reversibly. That is, each of
