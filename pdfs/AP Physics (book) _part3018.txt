27–5 Compton Effect
Besides the photoelectric effect, a number of other experiments were carried out
in the early twentieth century which also supported the photon theory. One of
these was the Compton effect (1923) named after its discoverer, A. H. Compton
(1892–1962). Compton aimed short-wavelength lig
