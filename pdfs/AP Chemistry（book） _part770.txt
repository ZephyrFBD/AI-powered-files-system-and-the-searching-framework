CHAPTER 5 Thermochemistry
Using Enthalpies of Formation to Calculate  
Enthalpies of Reaction
We can use Hess’s law and tabulations of ∆Hf° values, such as those in Table 5.3 and 
 
Appendix C, to calculate the standard enthalpy change for any reaction for which we 
know the ∆Hf° values for all reactants and products. For example, consider the combus-
tion of propane under standard conditions:
 
C3H81g2 + 5 O21g2 ¡  3 CO21g2 + 4 H2O1l2 
We can write this equation as the sum of three equations associated with standard 
 
enthalpies of formation:
 
C3H81g2 ¡  3 C1s2 + 4 H21g2  
∆H1 = -∆Hf°3C3H81g24 
[5.26]
 
3 C1s2 + 3 O21g2 ¡  3 CO21g2  
∆H2 = 3∆Hf° 3CO21g24  
[5.27]
 
4 H21g2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  4 H2O1l2  
∆H3 = 4∆Hf°3H2O1l24
