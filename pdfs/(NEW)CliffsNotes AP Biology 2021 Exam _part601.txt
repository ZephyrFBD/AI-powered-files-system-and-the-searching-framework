1. The hypothalamus and anterior pituitary initiate the reproductive cycle. The hypothalamus monitors the
levels of estrogen and progesterone in the blood. In a negative feedback fashion, low levels of these hormones
stimulate the hypothalamus to secrete GnRH, which, in turn, stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.
2. The follicle develops. FSH stimulates the development of the follicle and the oocyte.
 
3. The follicle secretes estrogen. LH stimulates the secretion of estrogen from the follicle.
4. Ovulation occurs. Positive feedback from rising levels of estrogen stimulates the anterior pituitary (through
GnRH from the hypothalamus) to produce a sudden midcycle surge of LH. This high level of LH triggers ovulation.
5. The corpus luteum secretes estrogen and progesterone. After ovulation, the follicle, now called the corpus
luteum, continues to develop under the influence of LH and secretes both estrogen and progesterone.
6. The en
