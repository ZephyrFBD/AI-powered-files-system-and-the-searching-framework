nsight because the chimpanzee has figured out how
to solve the problem without external influence or learning.

A
Viruses would display reproductive strategies most similar to r-strategists because they aim to reproduce
as fast as possible and create as many progeny as possible in order to increase their odds of transmission
to other hosts.
3.
C
They would be considered secondary consumers because they consume the primary consumers
(plankton), which consume algae (the producers).
4.
C
Since brook trout can tolerate pH values as low as 4.9 and do not appear to diminish, the pH of the creek
must exceed 4.9, so eliminate (D). Since crayfish cannot tolerate pH levels lower than 5.4, the pH of the
stream must have dropped lower than this value. Only (C) falls in this range.
5.
C
Only acid rain would directly explain why the pH would drop in the creek over the time period.
6.
D
Based on Table 1, the pH must exceed 6.1 for snails to be able to return to the creek ecosystem.
