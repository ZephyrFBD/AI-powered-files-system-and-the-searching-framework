that toughens rubber by 
introducing cross-linking between polymer chains. 
 (Section 12.8)
Selenium is used in photoelectric cells and light meters because its electrical conduc-
tivity increases greatly upon exposure to light. Photocopiers also depend on the photo-
conductivity of selenium. Photocopy machines contain a belt or drum coated with a film 
of selenium. This drum is electrostatically charged and then exposed to light reflected 
from the image being photocopied. The charge drains from the regions where the sele-
nium film has been made conductive by exposure to light. A black powder (the toner) 
sticks only to the areas that remain charged. The photocopy is made when the toner is 
transferred to a sheet of plain paper.
Sulfides
When an element is less electronegative than sulfur, sulfides that contain S2 -  form. 
Many metallic elements are found in the form of sulfide ores, such as PbS (galena) and 
HgS (cinnabar). A series of related ores containing the disulfide ion, S2
