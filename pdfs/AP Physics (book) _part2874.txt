This lens is used to view
a red and yellow object which is 66.0 cm away from the
lens. The index of refraction of the glass is 1.5106 for red
light and 1.5226 for yellow light. What are the locations of
the red and yellow images formed by the lens? [Hint: See
Section 23–10.]

diffraction for the 100-inch (254-cm mirror diameter)
Mt.Wilson telescope 
54. (I) What is the resolving power of a

55. (II) Two stars 18 light-years away are barely resolved by a
66-cm (mirror diameter) telescope. How far apart are the
stars? Assume 
and that the resolution is
limited by diffraction.
56. (II) The nearest neighboring star to the Sun is about 4 light-
years away. If a planet happened to be orbiting this star at
an orbital radius equal to that of the Earth–Sun distance,
what minimum diameter would
