a particular active site, called the 
turnover number, is generally in the range of 103 to 107 per second. Such large turnover 
numbers correspond to very low activation energies. Compared with a simple chemical 
catalyst, enzymes can increase the rate constant for a given reaction by a millionfold or 
more.
▲ Figure 14.27 Lysozyme was one of the first enzymes for which a structure–function relationship 
was described. This model shows how the substrate (yellow) “fits” into the active site of the 
enzyme.

Give It Some Thought
True or false: enzymes lower the energy of the transition state for a reaction.
