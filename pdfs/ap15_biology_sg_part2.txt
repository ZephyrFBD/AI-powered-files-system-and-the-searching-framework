g wheel, the activity is recorded as a dark horizontal line on an actogram. When the 
mouse is inactive, no dark line is recorded. 
  For the investigation, adult male mice were individually housed in cages in a soundproof room at 25°C. 
Each mouse was provided with adequate food, water, bedding material, and a running wheel. The 
mice were exposed to daily periods of 12 hours of light (L) and 12 hours of dark (D) (L12:D12) for 14 
days, and their activity was continuously monitored. The activity data are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Actogram of mouse activity under L12:D12 conditions. 
Each row represents a 24-hour period, and the dark horizontal lines 
represent activity on the running wheel. 
 
  After 14 days in L12:D12, the mice were placed in continuous darkness (DD), and their activity on the 
running wheel was recorded as
