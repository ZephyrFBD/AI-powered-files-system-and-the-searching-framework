Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven Science Practices.
