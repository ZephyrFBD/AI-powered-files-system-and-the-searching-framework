ent and administer the 
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods 
are based on a schedule in which the class meets five 
days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these 
recommendations have been made to aid in planning, 
teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on 
the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g., 
block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments 
called topics. The topic pages (starting on p. 34) 
contain all required content for each topic. Although 
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods, 
teachers should pace the course to suit the needs of 
their students and school.
