crucial for the functioning of the lysosome. If those enzymes
were not functional, the lysosome could not perform its activities, thus reducing, or even preventing, the
cell’s ability to function.
(d) If the hydrolytic enzymes were nonfunctional, the lysosome could not assist in digesting large molecules nor
could the lysosome break down waste products in the cell. The cell could simultaneously starve, since it
couldn’t digest its food, and be poisoned by its own waste products. In addition, the cell’s ability to defend
itself against invading pathogens would be compromised.

13. (a) Two types of passive transport are diffusion and facilitated diffusion. In diffusion, a molecule moves from
an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, and no energy is required. In facilitated
diffusion, a molecule moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration with the
assistance of a transport protein. Again, no energy is required.
