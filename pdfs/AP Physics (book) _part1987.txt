e less resistance (see Eq. 18–3) and thus
can carry more current without becoming too hot. When a wire carries more
current than is safe, it is said to be “overloaded.” To prevent overloading, fuses or
circuit breakers are installed in circuits. They are basically switches (Fig. 18–19, top
of next page) that open the circuit when the current exceeds a safe value.
A 20-A fuse or circuit breaker, for example, opens when the current passing
through it exceeds 20 A. If a circuit repeatedly burns out a fuse or opens a circuit
breaker, and no connected device requires more than 20 A, there are two possi-
bilities: there may be too many devices drawing current in that circuit; or there is
a fault somewhere, such as a “short.” A short, or “short circuit,” means that two
wires have touched that should not have (perhaps because the insulation has worn
through) so the path of the current is shortened through a path of very low 
resistance. With reduced resistance, the current becomes very large a
