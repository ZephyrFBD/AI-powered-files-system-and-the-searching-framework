The uncertainty principle, however, tells us that energy conservation can be
violated by an amount

We saw in Section 28–3 that this is a result of the wave–particle duality. Thus
quantum mechanics allows conservation of energy to be violated for brief
periods that may be long enough for an particle to “tunnel” through the barrier.
