anges of a solid to liquid (melting), 
solid to gas (sublimation), and liquid to gas (vaporization) are all 
endothermic processes. Thus, the heat of fusion (melting), the heat 
of sublimation, and the heat of vaporization are all positive quantities. 
The reverse processes (freezing, deposition, and condensation) are 
exothermic.
A gas cannot be liquefied by application of pressure if the tem-
perature is above its critical temperature. The pressure required to 
liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. 
When the temperature exceeds the critical temperature and the pres-
sure exceeds the critical pressure, the liquid and gas phases coalesce 
to form a supercritical fluid.
VAPOR PRESSURE (SECTION 11.5) The vapor pressure of a liquid 
is the partial pressure of the vapor when it is in dynamic equilibrium 
with the liquid. At equilibrium the rate of transfer of molecules from 
the liquid to the vapor equals the rate of transfer from the vapor to 
the liqu
