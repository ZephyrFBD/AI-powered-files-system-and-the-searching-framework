ad to significant changes in the genome of a population.
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium reflects a state of constancy in a population’s gene pool. In other words, allele frequencies
remain stable from generation to generation if certain conditions are met: no mutations, no gene flow, random mating,
no genetic drift, and no selection. Because these conditions are rarely met, allele frequencies are typically changing,
reflecting evolution. The Hardy–Weinberg principle is represented by the mathematical equation p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1,
where p represents the frequency of the dominant allele and q represents the frequency of the recessive allele. Deviations
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium allow us to measure microevolutionary shifts in a population when one or more of the
Hardy–Weinberg parameters change. For example, if we go back to the study of the frequencies of alleles in a pesticide
resistance gene, after an area was treated with pesticides for two years, the resistance alleles increased to 1
