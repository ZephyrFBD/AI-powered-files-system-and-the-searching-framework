end of one strand faces the 3’ end
of other strand. Sugar, phosphate and
nitrogenous bases contribute to the DNA
structure.
d.
DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted
around each other to form a helix. Adenine pairs
up with thymine and cytosine pairs with
guanine. The two strands are anti-parallel in
nature; that is, the 3’ end of one strand faces the
5’ end of other strand. Only sugar contributes to
the DNA structure.
39. Provide a brief summary of the Sanger sequencing
method.
a.
Frederick Sanger’s sequencing is a chain
termination method that is used to generate
DNA fragments that terminate at different points
using dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides. DNA is
separated by electrophoresis on the basis of size.
The DNA sequence can be read out on an
electropherogram generated by a laser scanner.
b.
Frederick Sanger’s sequencing is a chain
elongation method that is used to generate DNA
fragments that elongate at different points using
dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides. DNA is
separated
