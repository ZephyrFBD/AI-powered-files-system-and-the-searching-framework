ance to impurities 
such as lead, sulfur, and phosphorus that can poison or disable the 
catalyst. Palladium is a slightly less expensive alternative to platinum, 
but it is more sensitive to poisoning from impurities in the exhaust 
stream. Rhodium is the metal of choice for reduction of nitrogen 
oxides and has reasonable activity for the oxidation reactions. Unfor-
tunately, it is even rarer and more expensive than platinum. Catalytic 
converters currently account for approximately 35% of the world’s 
use of platinum, 65% of palladium, and 95% of rhodium. Deposits of 
these metals tend to be concentrated in South Africa and Russia.

As substrate molecules enter the active site, they are somehow activated so that they 
are capable of reacting rapidly. This activation proce
