Al2 +(g) ¡ Al3 +(g) + le-. The process for the ﬁrst ionization energy 
requires the least amount of energy. 7.39 Of these three elements, Li 
has the highest second ionization energy. Both Li+ and K+ have the 
stable electron conﬁgurations of noble gases, but the unshielded 1s 
electron of Li+ is much closer to the nucleus and requires more energy 
to remove. 7.41 (a) The smaller the atom, the larger its ﬁrst ionization 
energy. (b) Of the nonradioactive elements, He has the largest and Cs 
has the smallest ﬁrst ionization energy. 7.43 (a) Cl (b) Ca (c) K (d) Ge
