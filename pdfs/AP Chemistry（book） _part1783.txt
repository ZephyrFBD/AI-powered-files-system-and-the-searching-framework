Properties of Liquid Crystals
SOLUTION
Analyze We have three molecules with different structures, and 
we are asked to determine which one is most likely to be a liquid 
crystalline substance.
Plan We need to identify all structural features that might induce 
liquid crystalline behavior.
Solve Molecule (i) is not likely to be liquid crystalline because 
the absence of double and/or triple bonds makes this molecule 
flexible rather than rigid. Molecule (iii) is ionic, and the generally 
high melting points of ionic materials make it unlikely that this 
substance is liquid crystalline. Molecule (ii) possesses the charac-
teristic long axis and the kinds of structural features often seen 
in liquid crystals: The molecule has a rod-like shape, the double 
bonds and benzene rings provide rigidity, and the polar COOCH3 
group creates a dipole moment.
