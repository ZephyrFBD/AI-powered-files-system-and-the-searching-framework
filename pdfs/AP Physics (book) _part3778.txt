simulations predict a large-scale distribution of galaxies very similar to what is
seen today (Fig. 33–34). These simulations are very successful if they contain
dark energy and dark matter; and the dark matter needs to be cold (slow
speed—think of Eq. 13–8,
where T is temperature), rather than
“hot” dark matter such as neutrinos which move at or very near the speed of
light. Indeed, the modern cosmological model is called the 
model, where
lambda 
stands for the cosmological constant, and CDM is cold dark matter.
Cosmologists have gained substantial confidence in this cosmological model
from such a precise fit between observations and theory. They can also extract
very precise values for cosmological parameters which previously were only
known with low accuracy. The CMB is such an important cosmol
