 formula unit (3Co(NH3)643+ plus three Cl- 
ions), whereas CoCl3 # 5 NH3 yields only three ions per formula unit (3Co(NH3)5Cl42+ and 
two Cl- ions). Furthermore, the reaction of the compounds with excess aqueous silver 
nitrate leads to the precipitation of different amounts of AgCl(s). When CoCl3 # 6 NH3 is 
treated with excess AgNO3(aq), 3 mol of AgCl(s) precipitate per mole of complex, which 
means all three Cl- ions in the complex can react to form AgCl(s). By contrast, when 
CoCl3 # 5 NH3 is treated with excess AgNO3(aq), only 2 mol of AgCl(s) precipitate per 
mole of complex, telling us that one of the Cl- ions in the complex does not react. These 
results are summarized in Table 23.3.
In 1893, the Swiss chemist Alfred Werner (1866â€“1919) proposed a theory that suc-
cessfully explained the observations in Table 23.3. In a theory that became the basis for 
understanding coordination chemistry, Werner proposed that any metal ion exhibits 
both a primary valence and a secondary valen
