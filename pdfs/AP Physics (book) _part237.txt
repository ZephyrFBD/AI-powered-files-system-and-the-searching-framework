ring the length of the corresponding arrow and using the scale
shown
When we write the symbol for a vector, we will always use boldface type, with a
tiny arrow over the symbol. Thus for velocity we write 
If we are concerned only
with the magnitude of the vector, we will write simply v, in italics, as we do for
other symbols.
3–2 Addition of Vectors—Graphical
Methods
Because vectors are quantities that have direction as well as magnitude, they must
be added in a special way. In this Chapter, we will deal mainly with displacement
vectors, for which we now use the symbol 
and velocity vectors,
But the results
will apply for other vectors we encounter later.
We use simple arithmetic for adding scalars. Simple arithmetic can also be
used for adding vectors if they are in the same direction. For example, if a 
person walks 8 km east one day, and 6 km east the next day, the person will be
east of the point of origin. We say that the net or resultant
displacement is 14 km to the east (Fig. 3–
