ng the mating individuals. For
example, in sexual selection, allele frequencies increase if they produce traits that give individuals a better chance of
obtaining a mate. Traits that help males win contests or traits that make them more attractive to females have a
selective advantage. Inbreeding is another form of nonrandom mating.
This question is about how evolution occurs, so make sure that for each part of the question your answer makes it
clear how the mechanism causes evolution. In other words, donâ€™t just define each of the mechanisms.
a. Allopatric speciation occurs when a geographic barrier, such as a river or mountain range, divides the existing
population into two populations. Separated in this manner, the two populations are reproductively isolated and gene
flow does not occur. As a result, changes in allele frequencies in one population may not occur in the other
population. If the environmental conditions vary between the two populations, natural selection may favor diffe
