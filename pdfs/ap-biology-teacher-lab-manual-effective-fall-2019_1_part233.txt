the cell? If you are on a PC, try hitting the F9 key several times to force 
recalculation. On a Mac, enter cmd + or cmd =. What happens to the value in the cell? 
Describe your results in your lab notebook. 
The RAND function returns random numbers between 0 and 1 in decimal format. 
This is a powerful feature of spreadsheets. It allows us to enter a sense of randomness to 
our calculations if it is appropriate — and here it is when we are “randomly” choosing 
gametes from a gene pool. Go ahead and delete the RAND function in the cell. 
Let’s select two gametes from the gene pool. In cell E5, let’s generate a random 
number, compare it to the value of p, and then place either an A gamete or a B gamete 
in the cell. We’ll need two functions to do this, the RAND function and the IF function. 
Check the help menu if necessary.

Note that the function entered in cell E5 is 
=IF(RAND()<=D$2,“
A”
, “B”)
