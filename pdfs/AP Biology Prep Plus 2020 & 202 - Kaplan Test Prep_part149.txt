polar, because the interior of the membrane is far
too hydrophobic for others to make it through without assistance. This
assistance can come in the form of membrane-spanning proteins, which
either can bind to extracellular molecules and bring them inside the cell
via a conformational change or can open up a temporary tunnel through
the membrane lipids so that the molecules can pass through.

Surface Area and Volume
The surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell limits its size. While
surface area aﬀects the transport of nutrients into and waste out
of a cell, volume aﬀects the consumption and production of
resources and waste. As a cell grows, the surface area-to-volume
ratio decreases. At a certain point, the cell will be unable to
maintain the rate of transport that is needed to support the
increased cellular volume. Thus, the cell will not obtain suﬀicient
nutrients and waste will accumulate within the cell—both of
which will lead to cell death.
