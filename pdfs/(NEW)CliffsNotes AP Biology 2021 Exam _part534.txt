The Endocrine System
The endocrine system produces hormones that help maintain homeostasis and regulate reproduction and
development. A hormone is a long-distance, chemical messenger produced in one part of the body that affects target
cells in another part of the body. Hormones have the following general characteristics:
1. Hormones are transported throughout the body in the blood. 2. Minute amounts of hormones can have significant
influence on target cells.
 
3. Hormones may be steroids, peptides, or modified amino acids.
Through the various sensory neurons, the brain—and especially a portion of the forebrain, the hypothalamus—
monitors the external environment and internal conditions of the body. As the master integrator of information, the
brain may determine that some kind of action is necessary to maintain homeostasis or that conditions are appropriate
to activate developmental changes. These actions are initiated by special neurosecretory cells that link the
