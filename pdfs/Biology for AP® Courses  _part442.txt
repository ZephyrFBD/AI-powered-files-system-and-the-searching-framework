ed that when you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches? That’s because you are tearing the rigid
cell walls of the celery cells with your teeth.
Figure 4.16 Cellulose is a long chain of β-glucose molecules connected by a 1-4 linkage. The dashed lines at each
end of the figure indicate a series of many more glucose units. The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an
entire cellulose molecule.
Chloroplasts
Like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function.
Chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon
dioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. This is a major difference between plants and animals; plants
(autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars, while animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food.
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the sp
