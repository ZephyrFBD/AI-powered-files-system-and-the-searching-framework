 from both parents. Second, homologous chromosome pairs randomly align across the
metaphase plate in metaphase I. As a result, chromosomes migrating to one pole are a random mixture of paternal
and maternal chromosomes. Third, the zygote is a combination of a randomly selected egg and a sperm. As a result
of these random arrangements of chromosomes, daughter cells are genetically variable.
The AP exam does not require you to use the names of the phases of the cell cycle (prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
telophase) in your responses. You would receive an equal amount of credit for your response if you omitted these
words and only described the events of mitosis and meiosis in the correct sequence of occurrence.
Heredity
Review
Much of the material in this chapter prepares you for solving genetics problems. A genetics problem is an analysis
of the characteristics (traits) of parents and offspring (progeny). Given the traits of one of these generations, you are
required to determine the tra
