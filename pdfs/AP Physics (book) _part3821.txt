 1, the second term is
and the third term is 
and so on. Thus, when x is small, we can ignore all
but the first two (or three) terms and can write
(A;6)
This approximation often allows us to solve an equation easily that otherwise
might be very difficult. Some examples of the binomial expansion are
where
As a numerical example, let us evaluate 
using the binomial expan-
sion since
is much smaller than 1:
You can check with a calculator (and maybe not even more quickly) that
A–6 Plane Geometry
We review here a number of theorems involving angles and triangles that are
useful in physics.
1. Equal angles. Two angles are equal if any of the following conditions are true:
(a) They are vertical angles (Fig.A–1); or
(b) the left side of one is parallel to the left side of the other, and the right
side of one is parallel to the right side of the other (Fig.A–2; the left and
right sides are as seen from the vertex, where the two sides meet); or
(c) the left side of one is perpendicular to the l
