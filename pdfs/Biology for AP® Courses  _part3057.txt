must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane
charge.
Neuronal Charged Membranes
The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the
neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different
configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 26.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order
to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change
their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion

channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The
difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.
