a.
Large molecules present in intact food pass
through the digestive epithelium and enter the
cell through the membrane, thereby damaging
the nuclear membrane. Hence it must be broken
down.
b.
Fats present in intact food contain very large
molecules, which cannot pass through cell
membranes. Fats need to be passed through the
digestive epithelium to be utilized.
c.
Large molecules present in intact food cannot
pass through cell membranes. Nutrients need to
be passed through the digestive epithelium to be
utilized.
d.
Large molecules, if not broken down, produce
toxic substances that pass through the epithelium
of the digestive tract and are utilized by the cells.
This can be lethal to the cell.
52. What is the importance of neural responses to food
stimuli?
a.
Neural responses facilitate secretion
