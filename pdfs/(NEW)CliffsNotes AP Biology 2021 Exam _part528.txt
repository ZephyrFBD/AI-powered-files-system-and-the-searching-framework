concentrate in lymphatic tissues such as the lymph nodes, the thymus gland,
and the spleen. The various kinds of lymphocytes are grouped as follows:
1. B cells. These are lymphocytes that originate and mature in the bone marrow(remember B cell for bone). B cells
respond to antigens. The plasma membrane surface of B cells is characterized by specialized antigen receptors
called antibodies. Antibodies have the following properties:
Antibodies are proteins.
Each antibody is specific to a particular antigen.
There are five classes of antibodies (or immunoglobulins): IgA,
IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Each class is associated with a particular activity.
 
Each class of antibodies is a variation of a basic Y-shaped protein that consists of constant regions and variable
regions. The variable regions are sequences of amino acids that differ among antibodies and give them specificity to
antigens.
Antibodies inactivate antigens by binding to them. Inactivation is followed by macrophage phagocytosis. I
