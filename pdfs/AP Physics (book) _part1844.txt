gy) is proportional to how much charge flows, which in turn depends on how
long the light is on. If over a given period of time 5.0 C of charge flows through
the light, the total energy transformed is 
If the headlight
is left on twice as long, 10.0 C of charge will flow and the energy transformed is
Table 17–1 presents some typical voltages.
(10.0 C)(12.0 V) = 120 J.
(5.0 C)(12.0 V) = 60 J.

17–2 Relation between Electric Potential
and Electric Field
The effects of any charge distribution can be described either in terms of electric field
or in terms of electric potential. Electric potential is often easier to use because it is
a scalar, whereas electric field is a vector. There is an intimate connection between
the potential and the fi
