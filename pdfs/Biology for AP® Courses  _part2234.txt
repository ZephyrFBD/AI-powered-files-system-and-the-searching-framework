he groups become more specific,
until one branch ends as a single species. For example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms
into three large categories called a domain: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within each domain is a second category called
a kingdom. After kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: phylum, class, order, family, genus,
and species (Figure 20.5).

Figure 20.5 The taxonomic classification system uses a hierarchical model to organize living organisms into
increasingly specific categories. The common dog, Canis lupus familiaris, is a subspecies of Canis lupus, which also
includes the wolf and dingo. (credit “dog”: modification of work by Janneke Vreugdenhil)
The kingdom Animalia stems from the Eukarya domain. For the common dog, the classification levels would be as shown
in Figure 20.5. Therefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms. For
