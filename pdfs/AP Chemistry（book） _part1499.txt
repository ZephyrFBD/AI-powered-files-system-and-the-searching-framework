 9.11  For each of these contour representations of molecular orbit-
als, identify (a) the atomic orbitals (s or p) used to construct 
the MO (b) the type of MO (s or p), (c) whether the MO is 
bonding or antibonding, and (d) the locations of nodal 
planes. [Sections 9.7 and 9.8]

 9.12  The diagram that follows shows the highest-energy occupied 
MOs of a neutral molecule CX, where element X is in the 
same row of the periodic table as C. (a) Based on the number 
of electrons, can you determine the identity of X? (b) Would 
the molecule be diamagnetic or paramagnetic? (c) Consider 
the p
2p MOs of the molecule. Would you expect them to have 
a greater atomic orbital contribution from C, have a greater 
atomic orbital contribution from X, or be an equal mixture 
of atomic orbitals from the two atoms? [Section 9.8]
