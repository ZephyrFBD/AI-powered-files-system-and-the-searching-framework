ENE-1.J
Explain how cells capture 
energy from light and transfer 
it to biological molecules for 
storage and use.
ENE-1.J.1
During photosynthesis, chlorophylls absorb 
energy from light, boosting electrons to a 
higher energy level in photosystems I and II.

ENE-1.J
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.J.2
Photosystems I and II are embedded in the 
internal membranes of chloroplasts and are 
connected by the transfer of higher energy 
electrons through an electron transport 
chain (ETC). 
ENE-1.J.3
When electrons are transferred between 
molecules in a sequence of reactions as they 
pass through the ETC, an electrochemical 
gradient of protons (hydrogen ions)
