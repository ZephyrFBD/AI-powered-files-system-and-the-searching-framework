y occurring 
strains of Vibrio bacteria. The researchers found that some Vibrio bacteria secrete antimicrobial 
substances that inhibit the growth and reproduction of other bacteria (antagonism). The researchers 
also found that some strains of Vibrio bacteria produce no antimicrobial substances themselves but 
instead live in close proximity to other bacteria that produce antimicrobial substances to which they 
are not susceptible (cooperation). 
  By testing approximately 35,000 pairs of naturally occurring strains of Vibrio bacteria, the researchers 
identified 830 antagonistic interactions among genetically related Vibrio strains. The graph represents 
the probability of antagonism between any two given strains of Vibrio bacteria as a function of genetic
relatedness (genetic distance). The greater the genetic distance, the less related are any two bacterial 
strains. (3 points maximum)
