FIGURE 6–4 Example 6–2.
Does the Earth do work on the Moon?
The Moon revolves around the Earth in a nearly circular orbit, kept there by the
gravitational force exerted by the Earth. Does gravity do (a) positive work,
(b) negative work, or (c) no work on the Moon?
RESPONSE The gravitational force 
exerted by the Earth on the Moon 
(Fig. 6–5) acts toward the Earth and provides its centripetal acceleration, inward
along the radius of the Moon’s orbit. The Moon’s displacement at any moment is
tangent to the circle, in the direction of its velocity, perpendic
