 every species above the character label possesses that structure. For example, 
tigers and gorillas have hair, but lampreys, sharks, salamanders, and lizards do not have 
hair.

Figure 2. Cladogram of Several Animal Species
The cladogram above can be used to answer several questions. Which organisms have 
lungs? What three structures do all lizards possess? According to the cladogram, which 
structure — dry skin or hair — evolved first?
Historically, only physical structures were used to create cladograms; however, 
modern-day cladistics relies heavily on genetic evidence as well. Chimpanzees and 
humans share 95%+ of their DNA, which would place them closely together on

a cladogram. Humans and fruit flies share approximately 60% of their DNA, which 
would place them farther apart on a cladogram.
