showed this to be the case. Loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it
more difficult and costly to grow food.

Wild Food Sources
In addition to growing crops and raising animals for food, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily
fish populations. For approximately 1 billion people, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein. But
since 1990, global fish production has declined. Despite considerable effort, few fisheries on the planet are managed for
sustainability.
Fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the
marine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. In addition
to humans losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that a
