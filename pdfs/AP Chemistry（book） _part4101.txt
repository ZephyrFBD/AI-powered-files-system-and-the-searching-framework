ible electromagnetic radiation 18.19 (a) Photodissociation is cleavage 
of a bond such that two neutral species are produced. Photoionization 
is absorption of a photon with sufficient energy to eject an electron, 
producing an ion and the ejected electron. (b) Photoionization of O2 
requires 1205 kJ>mol. Photodissociation requires only 495 kJ>mol. 
At lower elevations, high-energy short-wavelength solar radiation 
has already been absorbed. Below 90 km, the increased concentration 
of O2 and the availability of longer-wavelength radiation cause the 
photodissociation process to dominate. 18.21 (a) A wavelength of 
145 nm is in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
(b) The energy of one mole of 145-nm photons is 826 kJ. This is more 
than enough energy to photodissociate O2, but not enough energy 
to photoionize O2. 18.23 Ozone depletion reactions, which involve
