29–10 Transistors: Bipolar and MOSFETs
The bipolar junction transistor was invented in 1948 by J. Bardeen, W. Shockley,
and W. Brattain. It consists of a crystal of one type of doped semiconductor
sandwiched between two of the opposite type. Both npn and pnp transistors can
be made, and they are shown schematically in Fig. 29–40a. The three semicon-
ductors are given the names collector, base, and emitter. The symbols for npn and
pnp transistors are shown in Fig. 29–40b. The arrow is always placed on the emitter
and indicates the direction of (conventional) current flow in normal operation.
The operation of an npn transistor as an amplifier is shown in Fig. 29–41.
A dc voltage 
is maintained between the collector and emitter by battery 
The voltage applied to the base is called the base bias voltage,
If 
is
positive, conduction electrons in the emitter are attracted into the base. The base
region is very thin, much less than 
, so most of these electrons flow right
across into
