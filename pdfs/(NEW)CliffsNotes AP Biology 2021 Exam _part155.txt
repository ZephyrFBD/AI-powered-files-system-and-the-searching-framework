diphosphate (ADP) and Pi (phosphorylation). Noncyclic photophosphorylation begins with PS II and follows these
seven steps:
 
1. Photosystem II. Electrons trapped by P680 in photosystem II are
 
energized by light. In Figure 5-1, two electrons are shown “moving” up, signifying an increase in their energy.
2. Primary electron acceptor. Two energized electrons are passed to a molecule called the primary electron
acceptor. This electron acceptor is called “primary” because it is the first in a chain of electron acceptors.
3. Electron transport chain. Electrons pass through an electron transport chain (ETC). This chain consists of
proteins in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast that pass electrons from one carrier protein to the next. Some
carrier proteins, such as the cytochromes, include nonprotein parts containing iron. The electron transport chains in
photosynthesis are analogous to those in the inner mitochondrial membrane in oxidative phosphorylation.
4. Phosphorylation. A
