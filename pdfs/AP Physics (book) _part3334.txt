CHAPTER 30
Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity
†The mass value for each element as given in the Periodic Table (inside back cover) is an average
weighted according to the natural abundances of its isotopes.
Many isotopes that do not occur naturally can be produced in the laboratory
by means of nuclear reactions (more on this later). Indeed, all elements beyond
uranium 
do not occur naturally on Earth and are only produced artifi-
cially (in the laboratory), as are many nuclides with
The approximate size of nuclei was determined originally by Rutherford from
the scattering of charged particles by thin metal foils. We cannot speak about a
definite size for nuclei because of the wave–particle duality (Section 27–7): their
spatial extent must remain somewhat fuzzy. Nonetheless a rough “size” can be
measured
