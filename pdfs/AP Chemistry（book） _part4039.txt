ir, 
thereby reducing the pressure on the liquid inside. If only 0.007 atm is 
exerted on the liquid in the glass, a very small reduction in pressure inside 
the straw will cause the liquid to rise. 10.3 At the same temperature, 
volume and the lower pressure, the container would have half as many 
particles as at the higher pressure. 10.5 For a ﬁxed amount of ideal gas at 
constant volume, if the pressure is doubled, the temperature also doubles.
