Insulin, a hormone secreted by pancreatic cells, stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells by mobilizing 
glucose transporter proteins (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. As depicted in Figure 1, binding of insulin to the 
insulin receptor triggers an intracellular signaling cascade in which certain molecules activate other molecules in a 
relay of the hormone signal to cell targets. One outcome of the signaling cascade is mobilization of GLUT4 from 
vesicle storage sites in the cytoplasm to sites at the cell surface, where GLUT4 allows glucose to enter the cell. 
In type 2 diabetes, the cellular response to insulin is disrupted, and individuals with type 2 diabetes cannot 
properly regulate their blood glucose levels. In an investigation of the insulin signaling pathway, samples of skeletal 
muscle were isolated from individuals who have type 2 diabetes and from individuals who do
