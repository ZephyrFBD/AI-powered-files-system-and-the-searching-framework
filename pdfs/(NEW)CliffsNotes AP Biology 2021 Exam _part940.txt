ts of transcription are
mRNAs that are translated to produce proteins that stimulate cell division.
7. A. As described in the opening description of the question set, the figure shows a mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) signaling cascade whose products (mitogens) stimulate cell division. A permanently activated Ras protein
would produce a constant supply of mitogens, which would result in uncontrolled growth and cell division.
Uncontrolled cell growth and division are the defining characteristics of cancer.
8. C. The RNA genome of a retrovirus contains the enzyme reverse transcriptase. In process I in the figure, reverse
transcriptase makes a DNA complement of the viral RNA molecule. In process II in the figure, reverse transcriptase
makes a second DNA molecule to complete a viral double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule.
9. B. Once the viral double-stranded DNA incorporates into the host DNA (as a provirus), the viral genes are
transcribed by RNA polymerase (in the same manner as the genes
