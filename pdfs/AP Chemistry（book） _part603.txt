ual reactions would be a futile 
task. It is far more fruitful to recognize patterns to determine the 
general category of a reaction, such as metathesis or oxidation- 
reduction. When faced with the challenge of predicting the out-
come of a chemical reaction, ask yourself the following questions:

oxidation-reduction reaction? This requires that there be 
both a reactant that can be oxidized and a reactant that can 
be reduced.
Being able to predict what happens during a reaction follows 
from asking basic questions like the ones above. Each question 
narrows the set of possible outcomes, steering you ever closer to 
a likely outcome. Your prediction might not always be entirely 
correct, but if you keep your wits about you, you
