em, To satisfy my longing
thoughts<162> at full, Let me this tell thee:  I have heard it said That this
fair lady, whilst<163> she liv'd on earth, Had on her neck a little wart or
mole; How may I prove that saying to be true?
FAUSTUS. Your majesty may boldly go and see.
EMPEROR. Faustus, I see it plain; And in this sight thou better
pleasest me Than if I gain'd<164> another monarchy.
FAUSTUS. Away! be gone! [Exit show.]--See, see, my gracious lord!
what strange beast is yon, that thrusts his head out at window?<165>
EMPEROR. O, wondrous sight!--See, Duke of Saxony, Two spreading
horns most strangely fastened Upon the head of young Benvolio!
SAXONY. What, is he asleep or dead?
FAUSTUS. He sleeps, my lord; but dreams not of his horns.
EMPEROR. This sport is excellent:  we'll call and wake him.-- What,
ho, Benvolio!
BENVOLIO. A plague upon you! let me sleep a while.
EMPEROR. I blame thee not to sleep much, having such a head of
thine own.
SAXONY. Look up, Benvolio; 'tis the Emperor calls.
