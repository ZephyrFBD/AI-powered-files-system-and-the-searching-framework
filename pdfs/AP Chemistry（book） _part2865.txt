esides photodissociation occur in 
the upper atmosphere, although their discovery has taken many twists and turns. In 1901, 
Guglielmo Marconi received a radio signal in St. John’s, Newfoundland, that had been 
transmitted from Land’s End, England, 2900 km away. Because people at the time thought 
radio waves traveled in straight lines, they assumed that the curvature of Earth’s surface 
would make radio communication over large distances impossible. Marconi’s successful 
experiment suggested that Earth’s atmosphere in some way substantially affects radio-wave 
propagation. His discovery led to intensive study of the upper atmosphere. In about 1924, 
the existence of electrons in the upper atmosphere was established by experimental studies.
The electrons in the upper atmosphere result mainly from photoionization, 
which occurs when a molecule in the upper atmosphere absorbs solar radiation and the 
absorbed energy causes an electron to be ejected from the molecule. The molecule then
