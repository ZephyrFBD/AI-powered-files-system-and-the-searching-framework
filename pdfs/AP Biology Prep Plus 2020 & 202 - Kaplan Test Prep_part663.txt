The mother in the first generation gives the disorder to all of her
children. In the second generation, only the females pass on the
disorder; they pass it on to 100% of their children. This supports
mitochondrial inheritance, making (A) correct. If (B) was correct, the
females in the first generation would have gotten a dominant allele
from their father and not shown the disorder. The reasoning in (C) is
not sound. Dominant alleles don’t always show up in every generation,
and the pedigree doesn’t match this even if it was true. Since
mitochondria are not inherited through the father, (D) is incorrect.

If this is a case of incomplete dominance, heterozygotes resulting from
self-crossing the F1 flowers should produce a 1:2:1 ratio of
red:pink:white, (A). Any ratio that significantly diﬀered from this would
cause the flower grower to reject the hypothesis of incomple
