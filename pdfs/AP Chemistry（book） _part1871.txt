is formed from the molten mixture. The properties of a heteroge-
neous alloy formed by rapid cooling of a molten mixture, for example, are distinctly differ-
ent from the properties of an alloy formed by slow cooling of the same mixture. 
Intermetallic compounds are compounds rather than mixtures. Because they 
are compounds, they have definite properties and their composition cannot be varied. 
Furthermore, the different types of atoms in an intermetallic compound are ordered 
rather than randomly distributed. The ordering of atoms in an intermetallic compound 
generally leads to better structural stability and higher melting points than what is 
observed in the constituent metals. These features can be attractive for high-temperature 
applications. On the negative side, intermetallic compounds are often more brittle than 
substitutional alloys.
