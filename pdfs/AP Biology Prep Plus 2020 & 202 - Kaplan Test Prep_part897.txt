into the newly accessible coastal region, another species of coastal bird
called Charadrius nivosus, also known as the snowy plover, began to
enter and nest in the new territory as well. Aȇer monitoring both
populations for five years, researchers were surprised to find that the
population size and growth rate of both populations appear unchanged.
What is the most likely explanation for this occurrence?
The snowy plover and black-necked stilt are closely related species
occupying diﬀerent niches.
