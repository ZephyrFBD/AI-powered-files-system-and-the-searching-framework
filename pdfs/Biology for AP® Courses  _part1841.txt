What are regions 1 through 5 in the diagram?
a.
1, 3, and 5 are exons; 2 and 4 are introns.
b.
2 and 4 are exons; 1,3, and 5 are introns.
c.
1 and 5 are exons; 2, 3, and 4 are introns.
d.
2, 3, and 4 are exons; 1 and 5 are introns.

A mutation results in the formation of the mutated mature-
mRNA as indicated in the diagram. Describe what type of
mutation occurred and what the likely outcome of the
mutation is.
a.
Mutation in the GU-AG sites of introns
produced a non-functional protein.
b.
A transversion mutation in the introns led to
alternative splicing, producing a functional
protein.
c.
A transversion mutation in the GU-AG site
mutated this mRNA, producing a non-functional
protein.
d.
Transition mutatio
