The body can perform difficult endergonic reactions by coupling them to ATP
hydrolysis, which is very exergonic.
When a cell needs energy, it takes one of these potential-packed molecules of ATP and splits off the third phosphate,
forming adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one loose phosphate (Pi), while releasing energy in the process.
ATP → ADP + Pi + energy
The energy released from this reaction can then be put to whatever use the cell pleases. Of course, this doesn’t mean
that the cell is above the laws of thermodynamics. But within those constraints, ATP is the best source of energy the
cell has available. It is relatively neat (only one bond needs to be broken to release that energy) and relatively easy to
form. Organisms can use exergonic processes that increase energy, like breaking down ATP, to power endergonic
reactions, like building organic macromolecules.
Sources of ATP
But where does all this ATP come from? It can be formed in several ways, but the bulk of it comes from
