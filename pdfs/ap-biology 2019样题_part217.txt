nships between the organisms and 
with translating how a relationship between 
two organisms resulted in their placement 
on the food web. Another common error is 
the incorrect placement of the arrows that 
indicate energy flow. Students should use 
their knowledge from Unit 3 to explain how 
energy and carbon are transferred through 
an ecosystem so that they can predict how 
changes in the environment can impact an 
ecosystem, both positively and negatively.
Throughout the course, students should 
practice providing support for their claims 
about biological systems. Connections 
to ecology throughout the course are 
fundamental and will help students to build 
this skill.
Developing Understanding
As a culmination of this course, Unit 8 brings together all other units to show how a 
system’s interactions are directly related to the system’s available energy and its ability to 
evolve and respond to changes in its environment. When highly complex living systems 
interact, communities
