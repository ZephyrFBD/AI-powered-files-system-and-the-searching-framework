energy is not maintained by a flow of heat Q into the body, however. Normally,
the body is at a higher temperature than its surroundings, so heat usually flows
out of the body. Even on a very hot day when heat is absorbed, the body has no
way of utilizing this heat to support its vital processes. What then is the source of
energy that allows us to do work? It is the internal energy (chemical potential
energy) stored in foods (Fig. 15â€“9). In a closed system, the internal energy
changes only as a result of heat flow or work done. In an open system, such as a
human, internal energy itself can flow into or out of the system. When we eat
food, we are bringing internal energy into our bodies directly, which thus increases
the total internal energy U in our bodies. This energy eventually goes into work
and heat flow from the body according to the first law.
The metabolic rate is the rate at which internal energy is transformed within
the body. It is usually specified in 
or in watts. Typi
