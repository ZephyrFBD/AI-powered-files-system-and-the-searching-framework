Indeed, very high temperatures are required for sustained fusion to occur, and
fusion devices are often referred to as thermonuclear devices. The interiors of the
Sun and other stars are very hot, many millions of degrees, so the nuclei are
moving fast enough for fusion to take place, and the energy released keeps the
temperature high so that further fusion reactions can occur. The Sun and the stars
represent huge self-sustaining thermonuclear reactors that stay together be
