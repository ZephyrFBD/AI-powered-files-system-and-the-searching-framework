61. It has been suggested that a heat engine could be developed
that made use of the temperature difference between water
at the surface of the ocean and water several hundred
meters deep. In the tropics, the temperatures may be 27°C
and 4°C, respectively. (a) What is the maximum efficiency
such an engine could have? (b) Why might such an engine
be feasible in spite of the low efficiency? (c) Can you imagine
any adverse environmental effects that might occur?
62. A cooling unit for a new freezer has an inner surface area of
and is bounded by walls 12 cm thick with a thermal
conductivity of 
The inside must be kept 
at 
in a room that is at 22°C. The motor for the 
cooling unit must run no more than 15% of the time. What
is the minimum power requirement of the cooling motor?
63. Refrigeration units can be rated in “tons.” A 1-ton air 
conditioning system can remove sufficient energy to freeze
1 ton 
of 0°C water into 0°C ice in
one 24-h day. If, on a 35°C day, the interior of a
