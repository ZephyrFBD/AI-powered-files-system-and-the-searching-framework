o the first equation above (Newton’s second
law for rotation of the pulley), we obtain
The unknown 
appears on the left and in the second term on the far right, so we
bring that term to the left side and solve for 
The numerator 
is the net torque, and the denominator 
is the total rotational inertia of the system. With 
and, from Example 8–10,
and 
, then
The angular acceleration is somewhat less in this case than the 
of
Example 8–10. Why? Because 
is less than the
15.0-N force in Example 8–10. The linear acceleration of the bucket is
NOTE The tension in the cord 
is less than mg because the bucket accelerates.
8–7 Rotational Kinetic Energy
The quantity 
is the kinetic energy of an object undergoing translational
motion. An object rotating about an axis is said to have rotational kinetic energy.
By analogy with translational kinetic energy, we might expect this to be given 
by the expression 
where I is the moment of inertia of the object and 
is 
its angular velocity. We can indeed
