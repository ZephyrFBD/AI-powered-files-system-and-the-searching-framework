This is the viewpoint of the twin on the Earth. But what about the traveling

Earth twin predicts. They cannot both be right, for after all the spacecraft returns
to Earth and a direct comparison of ages and clocks can be made.
There is, however, no contradiction here. One of the viewpoints is indeed
incorrect. The consequences of the special theory of relat
