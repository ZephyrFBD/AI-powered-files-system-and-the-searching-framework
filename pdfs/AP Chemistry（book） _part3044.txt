e to move about 
the entire volume of the sample. The added degrees of freedom increase the random-
ness of the substance, thereby increasing its entropy. We therefore see a sharp increase 
in the entropy at the melting point. After all the solid has melted, the temperature again 
increases and with it, the entropy.
Chemistry And life Entropy and Human Society
Any living organism is a complex, highly organized, well-ordered 
system, even at the molecular level like the nucleosome we saw at 
the beginning of this chapter. Our entropy content is much lower 
than it would be if we were completely decomposed into carbon 
dioxide, water, and several other simple chemicals. Does this mean 
that life is a violation of the second law? No, because the thousands 
of chemical reactions necessary to produce and maintain life have 
caused a large increase in the entropy of the rest of the universe. 
Thus, as the second law requires, the overall entropy change during 
the lifetime of a human, or any
