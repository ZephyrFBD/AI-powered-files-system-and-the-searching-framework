 exhibit similar properties?
18. Explain why potassium and sodium exhibit similar
properties.
19. Why are the chemical properties of the rare earths so similar?
[Hint: Examine the Periodic Table.]
20. The ionization energy for neon 
is 21.6 eV, and that
for sodium 
is 5.1 eV. Explain the large difference.
21. Why do we expect electron transitions deep within an atom
to produce shorter wavelengths than transitions by outer
electrons?
22. Does the Bohr model of the atom violate the uncertainty
principle? Explain.
23. Briefly explain why noble gases are nonreactive and why
alkali metals are highly reactive. (See Section 28â€“8.)
24. Compare spontaneous emission to stimulated emission.
25. How does laser light differ from ordinary light? How is it
the same?
26. Explain how a 0.0005-W laser beam, photographed at a
distance, can seem much stronger than a 1000-W street
lamp at the same distance.
27. Does the intensity of light from a laser fall off as the inverse
square of the distance? Explain
