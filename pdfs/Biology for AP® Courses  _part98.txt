Reproduction
Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide
to form two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new
individuals. When reproduction occurs, genes containing DNA are passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes
ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.
