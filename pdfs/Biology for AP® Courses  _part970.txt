shaped, membrane-bound structure inside a chloroplast where the light-dependent reactions of
photosynthesis take place; stacks of thylakoids are called grana
aqueous space bound by a thylakoid membrane where protons accumulate during light-driven electron
transport
distance between consecutive points of equal position (two crests or two troughs) of a wave in a graphic
representation; inversely proportional to the energy of the radiation
CHAPTER SUMMARY
8.1 Overview of Photosynthesis
The process of photosynthesis transformed life on Earth. By harnessing energy from the sun, the evolution of
photosynthesis allowed living things access to enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things
gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today.
Only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a
specialized pigment that absorbs certain porti
