rces on the car are the Earth’s gravity mg
downward, and the normal force 
exerted by the road perpendicular to its
surface. See Fig. 5–14, where the components of 
are also shown. We don’t
need to consider the friction of the road because we are designing a road to be
banked so as to eliminate dependence on friction.
SOLUTION (a) Since there is no vertical motion,
and
gives
or
[Note in this case that  
because  
]
We substitute this relation for 
into the equation for the horizontal motion,
which becomes
or
This is the formula for the banking angle 
no friction needed at this speed v.
(b) For  
and

),

We have been using the centripetal acceleration 
where r is the
radius of a circle. For a road, and in many other situations, we don’t have a full
circle, but only a portion of a circle:
still works and we often call r the
radius of curvature of that portion of a circle we are dealing with.
