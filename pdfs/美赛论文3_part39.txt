t place, we analyze effects caused by the shape of the tub. According to
the three model above, shape of bathtub will have an effect on the previous two
models (the even loop model and the body feeling model), especially on the first one.
On the other hand, when we turn to the equitation of the model, the main influence
focuses on the first two periods (the period of cooling and fusion).
When we are adding water, according to the model of draining away the warm
water, the shape of bathtub has no influence on the process of water movement and
heat conduction. However, different shapes of bathtub will lead to the change of
bathtubâ€™s length, width and height. Try to think about it. If the longest side of bathtub
changes with water flows as original methods, we need more time to conduct heat.
This will lead to the change of , and will also result to the difference of temperature
at the end state.
In the period of fusion, due to the difference of , we can also see the change of ,
if we star
