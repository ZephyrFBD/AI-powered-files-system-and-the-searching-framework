Laws of Probability 
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then:  
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 
If A and B are independent, then:  
P(A and B) = P(A) ¥  P(B) 
Hardy-Weinberg Equations 
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 
 
p + q = 1 
 
 
x  = sample mean  
 
n = size of the sample 
s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-based 
estimate of the standard deviation of the 
population)  
 
o = observed results 
 
e = expected results 
 
Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of 
distinct possible outcomes minus one. 
 
Mode = value that occurs most frequently in a data set 
 
Median = middle value that separates the greater and lesser halves of a data set 
 
Mean = sum of all data points divided by number of data points 
 
Range = value obtained
