â–² Figure 21.14 Uranium-235 fission. This is just one of many fission patterns. In this reaction, 
3.5 * 10-11 J of energy is released per 235U nucleus that is split.
*Other heavy nuclei can also undergo fission. However, these three are the only ones of practical 
importance.

can produce four fissions, and so forth, as shown in Figure 21.15. The number of fissions 
and the energy released quickly escalate, and if the process is unchecked, the result is a 
violent explosion. Reactions that multiply in this fashion are called chain reactions.
For a fission chain reaction to occur, the sample of fissionable material must have 
a certain minimum mass. Otherwise, neutrons escape from the sample before they 
have the opportunity to st
