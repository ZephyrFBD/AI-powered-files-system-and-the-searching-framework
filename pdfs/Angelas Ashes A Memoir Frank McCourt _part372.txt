ll bring the money and sweets. 
 
 My mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda’s wake. 
 
 Billy knocks on the door and there’s Mickey’s aunt.Well? 
 
 We came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come 
 
 to the wake. 
 
 She yells, Mickey! 
 
 What? 
 
 Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister’s 
 
 wake? 
 
 No. 
 
 But, Mickey, you promised . . . 
 
 She slams the door in our faces.We don’t know what to do till Billy 
 
 Campbell says,We’ll go back to St. Joseph’s and pray that from now 
 
 on everyone in Mickey Spellacy’s family will die in the middle of 
 
 the summer and he’ll never get a day off from school for the rest of his 
 
 life. 
 
 One of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey 
 
 himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn’t get 
 
 a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson. 
 
 Proddy Woddy ring the bell, 
 
 Not for heaven but for hell.
