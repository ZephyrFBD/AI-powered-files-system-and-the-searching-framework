 Fig. 3â€“3. (The subscript R stands for resultant.) Using a ruler and a protractor,
you can measure on this diagram that the person is 11.2 km from the origin at an
angle
north of east. In other words, the resultant displacement vector has
a magnitude of 11.2 km and makes an angle
with the positive x axis. The
magnitude (length) of 
can also be obtained using the theorem of Pythagoras
in this case, because 
and 
form a right triangle with 
as the 
hypotenuse. Thus
You can use the Pythagorean theorem only when the vectors are perpendicular
to each other.
The resultant displacement vector,
is the sum of the vectors 
and 
That is,
This is a vector equation. An important feature of adding two vectors that are not
along the same line is that the magnitude of the resultant vector is not equal to the
sum of the magnitudes of the two separate vectors, but is smaller than their sum.
That is,
where the equals sign applies only if the two vectors point in the same direction.
In our example (Fig. 3
