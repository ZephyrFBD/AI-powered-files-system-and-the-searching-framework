the mechanism and results are different. 
Transcription in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
involves enzymes and other molecules and sequences. For
each (prokaryote and eukaryote), describe the function
of TWO such components needed for transcription.
(a)
Messenger RNA produced by transcription in prokaryotes
differs from that in eukaryotes produced by transcription
and post-transcriptional processing. Describe TWO
post-transcriptional modifications in eukaryotes that lead
to these differences.
(b)
Explain how differences in the location of transcription
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes affect the translation
of a transcript.
(c)
