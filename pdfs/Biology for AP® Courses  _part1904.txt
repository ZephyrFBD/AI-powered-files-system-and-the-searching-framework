 helps with the research
efforts in these model organisms. The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome
annotation. Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR
primers and RNA targets.

How is deep sequencing an improvement on Sanger sequencing?
a.
Deep sequencing allows for much faster sequencing of short strands of DNA as compared to Sanger
sequencing which, reads only short sequences of DNA at a slow rate. Also, there is a high risk of chain
termination and problems with separation during Sanger sequencing.
b.
Sequence coverage is higher in Sanger sequencing as compared to deep sequencing.
c.
Sanger sequencing is suitable when there is only one nucleotide different
