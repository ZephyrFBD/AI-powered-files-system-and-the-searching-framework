a) A rubidium atom 
is at rest with one electron
in an excited energy level. When the electron jumps to 
the ground state, the atom emits a photon of wavelength
Determine the resulting (nonrelativistic)
recoil speed v of the atom. (b) The recoil speed sets the
lower limit on the temperature to which an ideal gas of
rubidium atoms can be cooled in a laser-based atom trap.
Using the kinetic theory of gases (Chapter 13), estimate
this “lowest achievable” temperature.
7. Suppose a particle of mass m is confined to a one-
dimensional box of width L. According to quantum theory,
the particle’s wave (with 
) is a standing wave
with nodes at the edges of the box. (a) Show the possible
modes of vibration on a diagram. (b) Show that the kinetic
energy of the particle has quantized energies given by
where n is an integer. (c) Calculate the
ground-state energy 
for an electron confined to a
box of width 
(d) What is the ground-state
energy, and speed, of a baseball 
in a box
0.65 m wide? (e) An el
