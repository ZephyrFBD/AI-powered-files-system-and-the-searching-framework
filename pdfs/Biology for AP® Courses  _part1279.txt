s yellow peas) produced
first generation (F1) offspring that all expressed the trait of one parent (e.g., all green or all yellow). Mendel used the
term dominant to refer to the trait that was observed, and recessive to denote that non-expressed trait, or the trait that had
“disappeared” in this first generation. When the F1 offspring were crossed with each other, the F2 offspring exhibited both
traits in a 3:1 ratio. Other crosses (e.g., height: tall plants versus short plants) generated the same 3:1 ratio (in this example,
tall to short) in the F2 offspring. By mathematically examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that genetic crosses behaved
according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events. In other words, Mendel used
statistical methods to build his model of inheritance.
As you have likely noticed, the AP Biology course emphasizes the application of mathematics. Two rules of probability can
be used to find the expected proportions of dif
