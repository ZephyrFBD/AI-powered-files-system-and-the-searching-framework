ferences. Identifying 
the precise location and sequences of genes not only allows us to better understand 
evolutionary relationships among organisms, but it also helps us to better understand 
human genetic diseases. The investigation covers concepts that pertain to genetics (big 
idea 3), as well as evolution.

ARTIFICIAL SELECTION
Can extreme selection change expression of a  
quantitative trait in a population in one generation?
 BACKGROUND
â– 
There are only a few possible laboratories available and appropriate for the high school 
classroom environment that can explore real-time natural selection with multicellular 
organisms. For reasons of time and resources, trying to measure natural selection is 
problematic. Many lab investigations that help students derive an understanding of 
natural selection are either computer simulations or structured simulations. However, 
a promising alternative is to have the students study and carry out an artifi
