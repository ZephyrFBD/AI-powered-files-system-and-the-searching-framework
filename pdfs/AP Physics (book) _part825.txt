ne torque acts on an object, the angular acceleration 
is
found to be proportional to the net torque. If all the torques acting on an object
tend to rotate it in the same direction about a fixed axis of rotation, the net
torque is the sum of the torques. But if, say, one torque acts to rotate an object 
in one direction, and a second torque acts to rotate the object in the opposite
direction, the net torque is the difference of the two torques. We normally assign
a positive sign to torques that act to rotate the object counterclockwise (just as 
is usually positive counterclockwise), and a negative sign to torques that act
to rotate the object clockwise.
Forces that Act to Tilt the Axis
We have been considering only rotation about a fixed axis, and so we considered only
forces that act in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. If there is a force
(or component of a force) acting parallel to the axis of rotation, it will tend to tilt
the axis of rotationâ€”the component
