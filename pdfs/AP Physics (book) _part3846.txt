is the woman’s
radial distance from the axis of rotation at O. If the man at B had this same veloc-
ity
the ball would reach him perfectly. But his speed is 
which is
greater than 
because
Thus, when the ball reaches the outer edge of
the platform, it passes a point that the man at B has already gone by because his
speed in that direction is greater than the ball’s. So the ball passes behind him.
Figure C–2b shows the situation as seen from the rotating platform as frame of
reference. Both A and B are at rest, and the ball is thrown with velocity toward B,
but the ball deflects to the right as shown and passes behind B as previously
described. This is not a centrifugal-force effect, because that would act radially
outward. Instead, this effect acts sideways, perpendicular to 
and is called a
Coriolis acceleration; it is said to be due to the Coriolis force, which is a fictitious
inertial force. Its explanation as seen from an inertial system was given above:
it is an effect of being
