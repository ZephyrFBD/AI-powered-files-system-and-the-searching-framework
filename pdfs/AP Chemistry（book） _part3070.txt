Now we can see the relationship between ∆Gsys (which we call 
simply ∆G) and the second law. From Equation 19.11 we know that 
∆G = ∆Hsys - T∆Ssys. If we multiply Equations 19.16 by -T and rear-
range, we reach the following conclusion:
Reversible process:       ∆G = ∆Hsys - T ∆Ssys = 0
Irreversible process:     ∆G = ∆Hsys - T ∆Ssys 6 0

Equations 19.17 allow us to use the sign of ∆G to conclude whether a 
reaction is spontaneous, nonspontaneous, or at equilibrium. When 
∆G 6 0, a process is irreversible and, therefore, spontaneous. When 
∆G = 0, the process is reversible and, therefore, at equilibrium. If a 
process has ∆G 7 0, then the reverse process will have ∆G 6 0; thus,
