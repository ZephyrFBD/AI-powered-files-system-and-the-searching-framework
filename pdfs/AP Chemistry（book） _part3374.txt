, despite its instability, we can still observe what remains from its 
formation in the early history of the universe.
Radioactive decay is a first-order kinetic process. Recall that 
a first-order process has a characteristic half-life, which is the 
time required for half of any given quantity of a substance to react. 
 
 (Section 14.4) Nuclear decay rates are commonly expressed in 
terms of half-lives. Each radioisotope has its own characteristic half-
life. For example, strontium-90 has a half-life of 28.8 yr:
       
90
38Sr ยก 90
39Y +
0
-1e  t1>2 = 28.8 yr 
[21.16]
Thus, if we start with 10.0 g of strontium-90, only 5.0 g of that isotope 
remains after 28.8 yr, 2.5 g remains after another 28.8 yr, and so on 
 
(Figure 21.6).
Half-lives as short as millionths of a second and as long as billions 
of years are known. The half-lives of some radioisotopes are listed in 
 
Table 21.5. One important feature of half-lives for nuclear decay is 
that they are unaffected by external conditi
