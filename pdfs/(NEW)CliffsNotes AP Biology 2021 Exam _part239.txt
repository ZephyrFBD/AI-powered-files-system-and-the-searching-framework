I, so the total is still 46 chromosomes.
3. C. Most plants do not have centrioles.
 
4. B. During telophase, cytokinesis begins, chromosomes uncoil into chromatin, and the nuclear membrane and
nucleolus reappear.
5. A. At metaphase, the chromosomes are arranged on the metaphase plate. The end of metaphase and the beginning
of anaphase is defined by the separation of the chromosomes into chromatids (which are now considered
chromosomes by themselves). Once anaphase begins, the chromosomes move to one pole or the other.
6. C. During prophase, the two MTOCs (and centrioles, if present) migrate to opposite poles as the spindle apparatus
develops between them. Also during prophase, the nucleolus and nuclear membrane disappear, and the chromatin
condenses into chromosomes. 7. D. Chromosomes replicate during the S phase of interphase.
8. A. Since the zygote consists of the union of two haploid gametes, the zygote would have the same number of
chromosomes as the parent. As in the parent cell,
