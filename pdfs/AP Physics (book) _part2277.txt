 value of electric field could make their
paths straight? In what direction must the electric field point?
*56. (I) In a mass spectrometer, germanium atoms have radii of
curvature equal to 21.0, 21.6, 21.9, 22.2, and 22.8 cm. The
largest radius corresponds to an atomic mass of 76 u. What
are the atomic masses of the other isotopes?
*57. (II) Suppose the electric field between the electric plates in
the mass spectrometer of Fig. 20–41 is 
and
the magnetic fields are
The source con-
tains carbon isotopes of mass numbers 12, 13, and 14 from
a long-dead piece of a tree. (To estimate masses of the atoms,
multiply by 
) How far apart are the lines
formed by the singly charged ions of each type on the photo-
graphic film? What if the ions were doubly charged?
*58. (II) One form of mass spectrometer accelerates ions by a
voltage V before they enter a magnetic field B. The ions
are assumed to start from rest. Show that the mass of an
ion is
where R is the radius of the ions’
path in the magneti
