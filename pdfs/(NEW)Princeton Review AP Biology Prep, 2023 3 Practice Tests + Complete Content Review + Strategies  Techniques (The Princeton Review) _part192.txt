s are inner mitochondrial
membrane, ER membrane, convoluted membranes in chloroplasts, brain
tissue, small intestine (villi and microvilli), alveoli in the lungs, or root hairs in
plants.
Centrioles
The centrioles are small, paired, cylindrical structures that are often found within microtubule organizing centers
(MTOCs). Centrioles are most active during cellular division. When a cell is ready to divide, the centrioles produce
microtubules, which pull the replicated chromosomes apart and move them to opposite ends of the cell. Although
centrioles are common in animal cells, they are not found in most types of plant cells.
Vacuoles
In Latin, the term vacuole means “empty cavity.” But vacuoles are far from empty. They are fluid-filled sacs that
store water, food, wastes, salts, or pigments. Vacuoles serve multiple functions in plant cells.
Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are organelles that detoxify various substances, producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a byproduct.
They also contain enzymes
