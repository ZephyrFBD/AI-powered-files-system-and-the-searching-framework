e solubilities are in millimoles of gas 
per liter of solution.
▲ Figure 13.14 Gas solubility decreases as pressure decreases. CO2 bubbles out of solution when 
a carbonated beverage is opened because the CO2 partial pressure above the solution is reduced.
Calculate the concentration of CO2 in a soft drink that is bottled with a partial pressure of CO2 of 4.0 atm over the liquid at 25 °C. 
The Henry’s law constant for CO2 in water at this temperature is 3.4 * 10-2 mol>L@atm.
Sample Exercise 13.2 
A Henry’s Law Calculation
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the partial pressure of CO2, P
CO2, and the 
Henry’s law constant, k, and asked to calculate the concentration 
of CO2 in the solution.
Plan With the information given, we can use Henry’s law, Equa-
tion 13.4, to calculate the solubility, SCO2.
Solve  SCO2 = kP
CO2 = 13.4 * 10-2 mol>L@atm214.0 atm2
 
 = 0.14 mol>L = 0.14 M
Check The units are correct for solubility, and the answer has two 
significant figures consistent with both the part
