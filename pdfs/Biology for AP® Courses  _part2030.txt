lvanicus prefers sandy soil, and the cricket (b) Gryllus firmus prefers loamy soil. The two
species can live in close proximity, but because of their different soil preferences, they became genetically isolated.
Behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place.
For example, male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various species of fireflies display their lights
differently. If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would
not mate with the male.
Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking
place; this is called a gametic barrier. Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive
structures simply do not fit together. For example, damselfly males and females of different species have differently shaped
reproductive
