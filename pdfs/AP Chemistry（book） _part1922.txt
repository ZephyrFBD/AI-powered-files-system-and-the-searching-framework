12.8 ∣ Polymers
In nature we find many substances of very high molecular weight, running up to mil-
lions of amu, that make up much of the structure of living organisms and tissues. Some 
examples are starch and cellulose, which abound in plants, as well as proteins, which 
are found in both plants and animals. In 1827 Jöns Jakob Berzelius coined the word 
polymer (from the Greek polys, “many,” and meros, “parts”) to denote molecular sub-
stances of high molecular weight formed by the polymerization (joining together) of 
monomers, molecules with low molecular weight.
Historically, natural polymers, such as wool, leather, silk, and natural rubber, were 
processed into usable materials. During the past 70 years or so, chemists have learned 
to form synthetic polymers by polymerizing monomers through controlled chemical 
reactions. A great many of these synthetic polymers have a backbone of carbon–carbon 
bonds because carbon atoms h
