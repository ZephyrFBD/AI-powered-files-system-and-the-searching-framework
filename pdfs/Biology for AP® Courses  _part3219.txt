In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae—leaf-like papillae
located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue, as seen in the Figure 27.10 micrograph. Foliate
papillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds. Finally, there are circumvallate papillae, which are wall-like
papillae in the shape of an inverted “V” at the back of the tongue. Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and
contains about 250 taste buds.
Each taste bud’s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days. These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called
microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore (illustrate in Figure 27.11). Food molecules (tastants) are dissolved
in saliva, and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli. The receptors
