Crossing over increases the genetic diversity, and therefore the fitness,
of a population by allowing homologous chromosomes to exchange
segments of DNA, sometimes even serving to unlink linked genes.
Thus, (D) is correct. (B) and (C) can be eliminated because the parent
organisms have no control over which regions of their chromosomes
are exchanged. (A) is incorrect because altering the number of
chromosomes in an oﬀspring is usually a fatal mutation. Additionally,
at the end of meiosis, organisms have gone from diploid to haploid,
allowing them to become diploid once again aȇer zygote formation.

Due to the change in environment, the fungi are most likely to utilize
sexual reproduction because it gives them the highest chance of
adapting to their new surroundings. Thus, (B) is correct. (A), (C), and
(D) all represent forms of asexual reproduction, which would not
provide vary much genetic variat
