If we solve Eq. 5–6 for v, we find  
and we see that a satellite’s
speed does not depend on its own mass. Satellites of different mass orbiting at the
same distance above Earth have the same speed and period.

Geosynchronous satellites
Geosynchronous satellite. A geosynchronous satellite is
one that stays above the same point on the Earth, which is possible only if it
is above a point on the equator. Why? Because the center of a satellite orbit is
always at the center of the Earth; so it is not possible to have a satellite orbiting
above a fixed point on the Earth at any latitude other than 0°. Geosynchronous
satellites are commonly used for TV and radio transmission, for weather forecasting,
and as communication relays.† Determine (a) the height above the Earth’s
