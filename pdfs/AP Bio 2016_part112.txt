-KAN plasmid carries an origin of replication (ori) and genes conferring resistance to the antibiotics 
tetracycline (tet) and kanamycin (kan) as represented in the figure. Cultures of E. coli bacteria were transformed 
with the plasmid. To determine the success of the transformation experiment, the bacterial cells were cultured in 
the presence or absence of tetracycline overnight. 
(a) Predict the most likely outcome of culturing transformed E. coli in the presence of tetracycline. Justify your 
prediction. 
(b) Researchers inserted a small fragment of human DNA into the pTET-KAN plasmid. Cultures of E. coli were 
transformed with the modified plasmid. The transformed bacterial cells were able to survive in the presence 
of tetracycline but were unable to survive in the presence of kanamycin. Draw an “X” on the plasmid 
template provided below to indicate where the human DNA fragment was most likely inserted. Justify your 
placement of the inserted human DNA.
