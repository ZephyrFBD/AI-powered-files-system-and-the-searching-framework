(e) Cannot be determined from the given information.
8. On a very hot day, could you cool your kitchen by leaving
the refrigerator door open?
(a) Yes, but it would be very expensive.
(b) Yes, but only if the humidity is below 50%.
(c) No, the refrigerator would exhaust the same amount
of heat into the room as it takes out of the room.
(d) No, the heat exhausted by the refrigerator into the
room is more than the heat the refrigerator takes out
of the room.

15–1 and 15–2 First Law of Thermodynamics
[Recall sign conventions, page 413.]
1. (I) An ideal gas expands isothermally,
performing
of work in the process. Calculate (a) the
change in internal energy of the gas, and (b) the heat
absorbed during this expansion.
2. (I) One liter of air is cooled at constant pressure until its
volume is halved, and then it is allowed to expand isother-
mally back to its ori
