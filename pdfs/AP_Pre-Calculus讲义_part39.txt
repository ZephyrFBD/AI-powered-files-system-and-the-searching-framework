 r are the lines x = a, where a is a zero of the denominator. 
2. (a) If n < m, then r has horizontal asymptote y = 0. 
      (b) If n = m, then r has horizontal asymptote y = an / bm . 
      (c) If n > m, then r has no horizontal asymptote.

1.8.3 Graphing Rational Functions 
1. Factor. Factor the numerator and denominator. 
2. Intercepts. Find the x-intercepts by determining the zeros of the numerator and the y-
intercept from the value of the function at x = 0. 
3. Vertical Asymptotes. Find the vertical asymptotes by determining the zeros of the 
denominator, and then see whether y →∞ or y →−∞ on each side of each vertical 
asymptote by using test values. 
4. Horizontal Asymptote. Find the horizontal asymptote (if any), using the procedure 
described in the box on page 300. 
5. sketch the Graph. Graph the information provided by the first four steps. Then plot as
