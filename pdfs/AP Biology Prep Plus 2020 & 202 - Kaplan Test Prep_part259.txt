Photoperiodism is the response to changes in the photoperiod (relative
lengths of day and night). Examples of photoperiodism in plants include
regulating flowering, tuber formation, bud dormancy, and loss of leaves.
To flower, some plants require a certain length of day or night. Long-day
plants typically measure the continuous length of night (darkness) and
flower when the night length is below a certain threshold (light-
dominant). Short-day plants, on the other hand, typically measure the
length of day and flower when the day length is below a certain threshold
(dark-dominant). Plants that do not depend on day length are day-
neutral. Though it is unclear how plants determine day or night, models
suggest the interactions between a plant’s circadian rhythms (biological
clock) and light cues from its environment govern a plant’s photoperiodic
response.
PLANT REPRODUCTION
Plants possess a reproductive advantage in that they can reproduce
vegetatively, while very few groups of a
