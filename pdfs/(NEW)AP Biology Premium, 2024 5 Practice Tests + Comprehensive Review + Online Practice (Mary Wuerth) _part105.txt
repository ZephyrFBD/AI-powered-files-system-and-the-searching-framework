because ribose is present in RNA but not in DNA.
10. (D) Deoxyribose is found in DNA; ribose is found in RNA. Choice (A) is incorrect because DNA does not
contain uracil. Choice (B) is incorrect because the hydroxyl group is attached to the 3′ carbon, not the 5′ carbon.
Phosphodiester bonds are found in both DNA and RNA, so choice (C) is incorrect.

11. (a) Saturated fatty acids have a chain of carbon atoms connected by single bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids have
carbon chains that contain at least one double bond between the carbon atoms.
(b) The independent variable is the type of fatty acid. The dependent variable is the melting point in degrees
Celsius.
(c) Cell A would have a more flexible cell membrane.
(d) Cell A would have a more flexible cell membrane because it contains more unsaturated fatty acids.
Unsaturated fats contain double bonds in random locations, causing bends in the long chains. These bends in
the fatty acid chains prevent unsaturated fats from f
