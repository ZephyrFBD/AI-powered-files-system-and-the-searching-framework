its temperature? [Section 10.4]
 10.6  The apparatus shown here has two gas-filled containers and 
one empty container, all attached to a hollow horizontal 
tube. When the valves are opened and the gases are allowed 
to mix at constant temperature, what is the distribution of 
atoms in each container? Assume that the containers are of 
equal volume and ignore the volume of the connecting tube. 
Which gas has the greater partial pressure after the valves are 
opened? [Section 10.6]
 10.7  The accompanying drawing represents a mixture of three 
different gases. (a) Rank the three components in order of 
increasing partial pressure. (b) If the total pressure of the 
mixture is 1.40 atm, calculate the partial pressure of each gas.

 10.8  On a single plot, qualitatively sketch the distribution of 
molecular speeds for (a) Kr(g) at -50 °C, (b) Kr(g) at 0 °C,  
(c) Ar(g) at 0 °C. [Section 10.7]
 10.9  Consider the following graph. (a) If curves A and B refer to 
two different
