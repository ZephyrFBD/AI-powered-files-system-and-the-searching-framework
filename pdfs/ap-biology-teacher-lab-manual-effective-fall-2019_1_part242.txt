a that predicts genotypes is 
(p + q)2 = 1, which works out to: p2 + 2pq + q2. 
Based on the calculations you made while testing your model, how would you answer 
the following questions? 
•  In the absence of random events (an infinitely large population), are the allele  
frequencies of the original population expected to change from generation to  
generation?  
•  How does this compare to a population that has random gamete selection but is 
small? 
•  What happens to allele frequencies in such a population? Is it predictable? 
This mathematical model can predict allele frequencies from generation to 
generation. In fact, it is a null model. That is, in the absence of random events or other 
real-life factors that affect populations, the allele frequencies do not change from 
generation to generation. This is known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-W 
equilibrium). The H-W equilibrium is a valuable tool for population biologists because 
it serves as a baseline to measure change
