e causes of genetic disorders follow:
1. Point mutations occur when a single nucleotide in the DNA of a gene is incorrect. This can occur if a different
nucleotide is substituted for the correct one (substitution), if a nucleotide base-pair is omitted (deletion), or if an
extra base-pair is inserted (insertion). Most point mutations have deleterious effects on gene function. Two
examples follow:
Sickle-cell disease , caused by a nucleotide substitution, results in the production of defective hemoglobin, the
oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. The defective hemoglobin molecule causes the red blood cell, usually
circular, to become sickle shaped when low-oxygen conditions occur (high altitudes, strenuous exercise). In
response, red blood cells do not flow through capillaries freely and oxygen is not adequately delivered throughout
the body (anemia). For individuals who are homozygous for the defective allele (sickle-cell disease), inadequate
oxygen supplies can lead to organ dama
