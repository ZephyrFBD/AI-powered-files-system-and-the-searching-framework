rived from reaction 
mechanisms, the step-by-step molecular 
pathways leading from reactants to 
products.
 14.7 ▶ Catalysis Examine the role of catalysts, 
substances that increase the rates of 
reactions but do not appear in the overall 
reaction equation, and consider biological 
catalysts called enzymes.
WHAT’S AHEAD
◀ ARCTIC GROUND SQUIRRELS can hibernate for more than half the 
year by allowing their bodies to fall to temperatures near the freezing 
point of water. Every 2 to 3 weeks they shiver involuntarily to raise the 
temperature back to 36 °C in order to minimize brain damage caused by 
the low-temperature hibernation.
The part of chemistry that deals with the reaction rates is known as chemical 
kinetics. It plays an important role in processes as diverse as the production of chemi-
cals on an industrial scale and the decay of radioactive isotopes used in medicine.
Chemical kinetics is also useful in providing information about how reactions 
occur—the order in which chemi
