ional species between lobe-
finned fishes and amphibians: one rock sample that is 350 million years old, one that is 370 million 
years old, and one that is 390 million years old. 
(a) Select the most appropriate sample of rocks in which to search for a transitional species between 
lobe-finned fishes and amphibians. Justify your selection. (2 points maximum) 
• 
Selection: Rocks from 370 MYA sample. 
• 
Justification: Transitional fossils are found between 380 MYA (when lobe-finned fishes lived) 
and 363 MYA (when amphibians appeared) OR between different strata/layers in the correct 
order. 
(b) Describe TWO pieces of evidence provided by fossils of a transitional species that would support 
a hypothesis that amphibians evolved from lobe-finned fishes. (2 points maximum)
