tron density from the bonding region and so is an antibonding molecular 
orbital. In both MOs, the electron density lies along the internuclear axis, so they are s 
molecular orbitals: s
2p and s*
2p.
The other 2p orbitals overlap sideways and thus concentrate electron density above 
and below the internuclear axis. MOs of this type are called pi 1P2 molecular orbitals 
by analogy to p bonds. We get one p bonding MO by combining the 2px atomic orbit-
als and another from the 2py atomic orbitals. These two p
2p molecular orbitals have the 
same energy; in other words, they are degenerate. Likewise, we get two degenerate p*
