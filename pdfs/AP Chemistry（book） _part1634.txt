one another, and b, a measure of the finite volume occupied by the molecules. His 
description of gas behavior is known as the van der Waals equation:

CHAPTER 10 Gases
The term n 2a>V2 accounts for the attractive forces. The equation adjusts the pressure upward 
by adding n 2a>V2 because attractive forces between molecules tend to reduce the pressure 
(Figure 10.21). The added term has the form n 2a>V2 because the attractive force between pairs 
of molecules increases as the square of the number of molecules per unit volume, 1n>V22.
The term nb accounts for the small but finite volume occupied by the gas molecules 
(Figure 10.20). The van der Waals equation subtracts nb to adjust the volume downward 
to give the volume that would be available to the molecules in the ideal case. The con-
stants a and b, called van der Waals constants, are experimentally determined positive 
quantities that differ from one gas to another. Notice in Ta
