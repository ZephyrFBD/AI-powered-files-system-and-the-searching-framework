n pair in the molecule were shared equally 
between its two atoms. (Section 8.5)
formation constant For a metal ion complex, the equilibrium 
constant for formation of the complex from the metal ion and 
base species present in solution. It is a measure of the tendency 
of the complex to form. (Section 17.5)
formula weight The sum of the atomic weights (AW) of the 
atoms in the chemical formula of the substance. For example, 
the formula weight of NO2 (46.0 amu) is the sum of the masses of 
one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms. (Section 3.3)
fossil fuels Coal, oil, and natural gas, which are presently our 
major sources of energy. (Section 5.8)
fracking The practice in which water laden with sand and other 
materials is pumped at high pressure into rock formations to 
release natural gas and other petroleum materials. (Section 18.4)
free energy (Gibbs free energy, G) A thermodynamic state 
function that gives a criterion for spontaneous change in terms 
of enthalpy and entropy: G = H
