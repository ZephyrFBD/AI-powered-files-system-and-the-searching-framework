communication. The age structure of a population allows us to
predict population growth. Unchecked human population growth could have dire long-term effects on our environment.
36.6 Community Ecology
Communities include all the different species living in a given area. The variety of these species is called species richness.
Many organisms have developed defenses against predation and herbivory, including mechanical defenses, warning
coloration, and mimicry, as a result of evolution and the interaction with other members of the community. Two species
cannot exist in the same habitat competing directly for the same resources. Species may form symbiotic relationships such
as commensalism or mutualism. Community structure is described by its foundation and keystone species. Communities
respond to environmental disturbances by succession (the predictable appearance of different types of plant species) until a
stable community structure is established.
