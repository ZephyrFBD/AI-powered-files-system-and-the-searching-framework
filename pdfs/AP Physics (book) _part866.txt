The rotational equivalent of Newton’s second law is
(8;14)
where 
is the moment of inertia of the object about
the axis of rotation. I depends not only on the mass of the
object but also on how the mass is distributed relative to the
axis of rotation. For a uniform solid cylinder or sphere of
radius R and mass M, I has the form
or
respectively (see Fig. 8–20).
The rotational kinetic energy of an object rotating about a
fixed axis with angular velocity 
is
(8;15)
For an object both translating and rotating, the total
kinetic energy is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of
the object’s center of mass plus the rotational kinetic energy 
of the object about its center of mass:
(8;16)
as long as the rotation axis is fixed in direction.
