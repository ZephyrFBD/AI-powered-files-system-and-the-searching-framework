oms and the ionic and covalent chemical bonds they 
form. We will discuss metallic bonding in Chapter 12.

Whenever two atoms or ions are 
strongly held together, we say there is a chemical 
bond between them. There are three general types 
of chemical bonds: ionic, covalent, and metallic. 
These three types of bonds are in the substances 
illustrated in Figure 8.1: We add table salt to 
water using a stainless steel spoon.
 
8.1 ▶ Lewis Symbols and the Octet 
Rule Learn about the three main types 
of chemical bonds: ionic, covalent, and 
metallic. In evaluating bonding, Lewis 
symbols provide a useful shorthand for 
keeping track of valence electrons. We learn 
that atoms usually follow the octet rule.
 
8.2 ▶ Ionic Bonding Explore ionic substances, 
substances in which atoms are held together 
by the electrostatic attractions between ions 
of opposite charge. Analyze the energetics of 
forming ionic substances and describe the 
lattice energy of these substances.
 
8.3 ▶ Covalent
