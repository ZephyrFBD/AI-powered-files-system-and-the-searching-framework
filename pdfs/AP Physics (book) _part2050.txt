For the most part in this Chapter, except in Section 19–6 on RC circuits, we
will be interested in circuits operating in their steady state. We won’t be looking at a
circuit at the moment a change is made in it, such as when a battery or resistor is con-
nected or disconnected, but only when the currents have reached their steady values.

19–1 EMF and Terminal Voltage
To have current in an electric circuit, we need a device such as a battery or an electric
generator that transforms one type of energy (chemical, mechanical, or light, for
example) into electric energy. Such a device is called a source of electromotive force†
or of emf. The potential difference between the terminals of such a source, when
no current flows to an external circuit, is called the emf of the sourc
