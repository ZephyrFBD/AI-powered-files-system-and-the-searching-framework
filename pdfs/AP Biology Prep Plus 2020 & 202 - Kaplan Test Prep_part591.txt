etrimental consequences.
Both intercellular (external) and intracellular (internal) signal
transmissions regulate gene expression. Signals may activate
transcription and tell the developing organism which genes to express and
when to express them. Additionally, external signals may trigger
intracellular signaling pathways or signal transduction cascades. For
example, in eukaryotes, cAMP is a small molecule that is involved in
amplifying the message in intracellular signaling pathways. In bacteria,
cAMP regulates metabolic gene expression. When glucose concentration is
low, cAMP accumulates and transcription factors are activated to turn on
the lac operon. In plant cells, ethylene triggers fruit-ripening. Special
receptors bind to ethylene, which triggers a cascade that turns oï¬€ anti-
ripening genes. Ripened fruits invite animals to consume them and
disperse their seeds. Ethylene produced during certain developmental
conditions can also signal seeds to germinate, prompt leaves to change
