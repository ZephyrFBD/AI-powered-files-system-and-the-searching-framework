E, of a single quantum equals a 
constant times the  
frequency of the radiation:
 
E = hn 
[6.2]
The constant h is called the Planck constant and has a value of 6.626 * 10 - 34 joule@ 
second 1J@s2.
 
Sample Exercise 6.2 
Calculating Frequency from Wavelength
The yellow light given off by a sodium vapor lamp used for public lighting has a wavelength of 589 nm. What is the frequency  
of this radiation?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Consider the following three statements: (i) For any electro-
magnetic radiation, the product of the wavelength and the  
frequency is a constant. (ii) If a source of light has a wavelength 
of 3.0 Å, its frequency is 1.0 * 1018 Hz. (iii) The speed of ultra-
violet light is greater than the speed of microwave radiation. 
Which of these three statements is or are true? 
(a) Only one statement is true. (b) Statements (i) and (ii) are 
true. (c) Statements (i) and (iii) are true. (d) Statements (ii) and 
(iii) are true. (e) All three statements are true.
