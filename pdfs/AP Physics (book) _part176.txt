We want to find the posi-
tion y of the ball after three different time intervals. Equation 2–11b, with 
x replaced by y, relates the given quantities (
a, and 
) to the unknown y.
SOLUTION We set  
in Eq. 2–11b:
The ball has fallen a distance of 4.90 m during the time interval  
to
Similarly, after 2.00 s 
the ball’s position is
Finally, after 3.00 s 
the ball’s position is (see Fig. 2–22)
NOTE Whenever we say “dropped,” it means  
Note also the graph of
y vs.
(Fig. 2–22b): the curve is not straight but bends upward because y is
proportional to t2.
