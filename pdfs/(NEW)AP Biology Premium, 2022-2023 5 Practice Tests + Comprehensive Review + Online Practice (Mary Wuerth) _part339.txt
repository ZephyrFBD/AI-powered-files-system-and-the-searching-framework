n in a pedigree. Recessive traits will appear in
offspring but do not necessarily appear in the parents because the parents may be unaffected heterozygous
carriers of the trait.
(c) Mitochondrial DNA is passed on from mother to offspring. The egg is thousands of times larger than the
sperm, so during fertilization, the zygote inherits its mitochondria from the mother. Mothers will pass on

(d) Autosomal dominant traits can be passed on to the next generation by either males or females.
Mitochondrial traits can only be passed on to the next generation by females.

13. (a) Females inherit one X chromosome from their male parent and one from their female parent. Since all of the
females produced from the cross have the same phenotype as their male parent (red eyes), red eyes must be
dominant to whi
