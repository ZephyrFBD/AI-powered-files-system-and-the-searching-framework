45. Describe the passage of energy from light until it is
captured in the primary electron acceptor.
a.
Chlorophyll molecules in the photosystems are
excited and pass the energy to the primary
electron acceptor where the energy is used to
excite electrons from the splitting of water.
b.
Chlorophyll a molecules in the photosystems are
excited and pass the energy to the primary
electron acceptor where the energy is used to
excite electrons from the splitting of water.
c.
Chlorophyll b molecules in the photosystems are
excited and pass the energy to the pri
