CHAPTER 20
Magnetism
2. The right-hand rule, in its different forms, is intended
to help you determine the directions of magnetic
field, and the forces they exert, and/or the directions
of electric current or charged particle velocity. The
right-hand rules (Table 20–1) are designed to deal
with the “perpendicular” nature of these quantities.
3. The equations in this Chapter are generally not
printed as vector equations, but involve magnitudes
only. Right-hand rules are to be used to find direc-
tions of vector quantities.

Magnetic Fields
Magnetic fields are somewhat analogous to the electric
fields of Chapter 16, but there are several important
differences to recall:
1. The force experienced by a charged particle moving
in a magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction
of the magnetic field (and to the direction of the
velocity of the particle), whereas the force exerted
by an electric field is parallel to the direction of the
field (and in
