arge polar and charged
molecules must use embedded membrane channels or transport proteins to enter or exit the cell. Small polar
molecules, like H2O, can pass through the membrane in small quantities. Specialized proteins called aquaporins
allow for most of the passage of water in and out of the cell.
Plants, fungi, and prokaryotic cells are surrounded by a cell wall outside of the cell membrane. These cell walls
are composed of large carbohydrates (cellulose in plants, glucans in fungi, and peptidoglycan in prokaryotes). The
cell walls provide rigidity to the cell and are an additional barrier to substances entering or exiting the cell.
Passive Transport
Passive transport is the movement of molecules from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration.
(See Figure 5.14.) Passive transport therefore is said to move molecules “down” their concentration gradient.
Passive transport does not require the input of energy. This movement of molecules down their concentration
