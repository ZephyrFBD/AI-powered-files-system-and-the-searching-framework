g through the concept of ‘he who most beneﬁts
from a crime is the one most likely to have commiĴed it’. The Latin
‘Cue bono?’ – Who beneﬁts? – is widely aĴributed to the Roman
orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero. No wonder it goes back
so far when the concept has been relevant to human behaviour since
history was recorded. Problem-Reaction-Solution is the technique
used to manipulate us every day by covertly creating a problem (or
the illusion of one) and oﬀering the solution to the problem (or the
illusion of one). In the ﬁrst phase you create the problem and blame
someone or something else for why it has happened. This may relate
to a ﬁnancial collapse, terrorist aĴack, war, global warming or
pandemic, anything in fact that will allow you to impose the
‘solution’ to change society in the way you desire at that time. The
‘problem’ doesn’t have to be real. PRS is manipulation of perception
and all you need is the population to believe the problem is real.
