▶Practice Exercise 1
A set of aqueous solutions are prepared containing different 
acids at the same concentration: acetic acid, chloric acid, and 
hydrobromic acid. Which solution(s) are the most electrically 
conductive? (a) chloric acid (b) hydrobromic acid (c) acetic 
acid (d) both chloric acid and hydrobro
