55. Structure and function in biology result from both the
presence of genetic information and the expression of that
information. Some genes are continually expressed,
whereas the expression of most genes is regulated,
commonly at the level of transcription. At the initiation of
transcription, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) provides
access to the DNA strand to be transcribed. The
5’TATAAA3’ sequence called the TATA box is found in
prokaryotes, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes. Even among
eukarya, when the TATA box is not present among
eukaryotes, the initiation of transcription invo
