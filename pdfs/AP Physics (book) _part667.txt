42. (II) What should be the spring constant k of a spring
designed to bring a 1200-kg car to rest from a speed of
so that the occupants undergo a maximum accel-
eration of 4.0 g?
43. (III) An engineer is designing a spring to be placed at the
bottom of an elevator shaft. If the elevator cable breaks
when the elevator is at a height h above the top of the
spring, calculate the value that the spring constant k should
have so that passengers undergo an acceleration of no more
than 5.0 g when brought to rest. Let M be the total mass 
of the elevator and passengers.
44. (III) A block of mass m is attached to the end of a spring
(spring stiffness constant k), Fig. 6–43. The mass is given
an initial displacement 
from equilibrium, and an initial
speed 
Ignoring friction and the mass of the spring, use
