▲ Figure 2.4 Cathode-ray tube with perpendicular magnetic and electric fields. The cathode rays  
(electrons) originate at the cathode and are accelerated toward the anode, which has a hole in its  
center. A narrow beam of electrons passes through the hole and travels to the fluorescent screen that  
glows when struck by a cathode ray.
*The coulomb (C) is the SI unit for electrical charge.
