AP Biology is a college-level course, but the equipment 
and chemicals needed for the labs are comparable to 
those required for a high school-level biology course. 
A list of instruments, equipment, and chemicals for 
AP Biology can be found at the beginning of each 
investigation in the AP Biology Investigative Labs: An 
Inquiry-Based Approach lab manual. Most lab manuals 
provide a list of materials and equipment needed for 
each lab investigation. Before purchasing materials, 
consult your lab manual and calculate how much of a 
substance or material may be needed for the number of 
students you have. 
Students will need access to basic lab equipment 
and glassware (e.g., beakers, graduated cylinders, and 
balances). Access to some specialized equipment, 
such as spectrophotometers, gel electrophoresis 
equipment and pH meters, may be needed to complete
