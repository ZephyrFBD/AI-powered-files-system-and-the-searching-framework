buttock did not get changed much. The
existing bacteria still made up the community. This means the interdigital bacteria didnâ€™t survive well there or could not
compete with the existing bacteria.
When deposited on the external auditory canal and the plantar heel areas, it looked like the new bacteria made an
impact and were competing with the existing bacteria. The plantar heel area, in particular, seemed to be recolonized by
the bacteria from the interdigital web space.
(d) If each deposition site is pretreated with known antibiotics, explain how this would likely affect the results. (2
points)
Antibiotics destroy bacteria. If the new sites had been treated with antibiotics, this would have wiped out the
existing bacteria. If the antibiotics were still present, then they would kill the newly deposited bacteria as well. Either
way, the skin sites would be clear of the existing bacteria and ready to receive the newly deposited bacteria, like a clean
slate. This would make the results s
