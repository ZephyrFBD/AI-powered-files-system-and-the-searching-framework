hin the test.
SECTION I
Section I consists of 60 multiple-choice questions that deal with an experiment, set of data, or with general
knowledge of biology. For a breakdown of the average percentage of each unit/topic, please refer back to this page.
These questions will also each test a specific Science Practice topic, the list of which can be found on this page. On
the following pages, we’ll provide an example of how that topic might be tested in multiple-choice form. These are
just model questions, so don’t worry about the answers—we just want you to see how these might look in context,
and with figures, diagrams, and/or charts.
Concept Explanation
1. Electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by their size and charge. DNA fragments are pipetted into

Which of the following best explains why DNA fragments migrate towards the positive pole through the
agarose gel?
