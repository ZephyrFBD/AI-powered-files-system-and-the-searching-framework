1–12 LR Circuit
Any inductor will have some resistance. We represent an inductor by drawing the
inductance L and its resistance R separately, as in Fig. 21–37. The resistance R
could also include any other resistance in the circuit. Now we ask, what happens
when a battery of voltage 
is connected in series to such an LR circuit? At the
instant the switch connecting the battery is closed, the current starts to flow. It is
opposed by the induced emf in the inductor because of the changing current.
However, as soon as current starts to flow, there is a voltage drop across the
resistance 
Hence, the voltage drop across the inductance is reduced
and the current increases less rapidly. The current thus rises gradually, as shown
in Fig. 21–38a, and approaches the steady value
