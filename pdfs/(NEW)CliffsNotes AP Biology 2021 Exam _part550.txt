ich bathes tissues with an oxygen- and nutrient-carrying fluid called hemolymph. The hemolymph returns to the
pumping mechanism of the system, the heart, through holes called ostia. Open circulatory systems occur in insects
and most mollusks.
2. In closed circulatory systems, the nutrient-, oxygen-, and wastecarrying fluid, blood, is confined to vessels.
Closed circulatory systems are found among members of the phylum Annelida (earthworms, for example), certain
mollusks (octopuses and squids), and vertebrates.
In the closed circulatory system of vertebrates, vessels moving away from the heart are called arteries. Arteries
branch into smaller vessels, the arterioles, and then branch further into the smallest vessels, the capillaries. Gas and
nutrient exchange occurs by diffusion across capillary walls into interstitial fluids and into surrounding cells. Wastes
and excess interstitial fluids move in the opposite direction as they diffuse into the capillaries. The blood, now
deoxygenated,
