In Figure A.6 the additional information has been supplied, information that seems to 
make the graph more useful to us in preparing for the exam. 
Figure A.6: Relation Between Study Time and Score on a Biology Exam in 2011 
This additional information includes scales, or axes, that are carefully marked with 
numbers, and labels and units that are neatly presented. Obviously, one cannot label all 
the points along the axes; that would make the numbers crowd together and look sloppy. 
The units should be marked at intervals that correspond more or less to the intervals 
between the experimental points. The small marks, called index marks, can be drawn in 
if the experimental points are very widely spaced. Most elegantly, a frame is put around 
the whole graph, and index marks are placed all around. This makes it easy to lay a ruler 
across the graph when interpolating between the experimental points. The diagram in
