he band gap changes substantially with size in the 1–10-nm range. As the particle 
gets smaller, the band gap gets larger, an effect observable by the naked eye, as shown 
in Figure 12.44. On the macro level, the semiconductor cadmium phosphide looks black 
because its band gap is small 1Eg = 0.5 eV2, and it absorbs all wavelengths of visible light. 
As the crystals are made smaller, the material progressively changes color until it looks 
white! It looks white because now no visible light is absorbed. The band gap is so large 
that only high-energy ultraviolet light can excite electrons into the conduction band 
1Eg 7 3.0 eV2.
Making quantum dots is most easily accomplished using chemical reactions in solu-
tion. For example, to make CdS, you can mix Cd1NO322 and Na2S in water. If you do not 
do anything else, you will precipitate large crystals of CdS. However, if you first add a 
negatively charged polymer to the water (such as polyphosphate, ¬1OPO2
-2n¬2, the
