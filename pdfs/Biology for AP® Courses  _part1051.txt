in the body.
Cancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that contribute to the development of
cancer. For example, HER2 is a cell-surface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent
of human breast cancers. Cancer biologists realized that gene duplication led to HER2 overexpression in
25 percent of breast cancer patients and developed a drug called Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is
a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 for removal by the immune system. Herceptin therapy helps to
control signaling through HER2. The use of Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to
increase the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Cell Death
When a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger
programmed cell death, o
