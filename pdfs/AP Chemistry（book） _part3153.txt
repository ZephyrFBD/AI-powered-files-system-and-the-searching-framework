lifetimes. At the heart of such develop-
ments are the oxidation–reduction reactions that power batteries.
As discussed in Chapter 4, oxidation takes place when an atom loses 
electrons; the opposite process, gaining electrons, is called reduction. 
 
 (Section 4.4) Thus, oxidation–reduction (redox) reactions occur 
when electrons are transferred from an atom that is oxidized to an atom 
that is reduced. Redox reactions are involved not only in the operation 
of batteries but also in a wide variety of important natural processes, 
including the rusting of iron, the browning of foods, and the respiration 
of animals. Electrochemistry is the study of the relationships between 
electricity and chemical reactions. It includes the study of both sponta-
neous and nonspontaneous processes.

The electricity that powers much 
of modern society has many favorable 
characteristics, but it has a serious shortcoming: 
it cannot easily be stored. The electricity that 
flows into power lines is co
