ect and the table, then almost no force is required to keep the object
moving. Notice that in each successive step, less force is required. As the next 
step, we imagine there is no friction at all, that the object does not rub against the
table—or there is a perfect lubricant between the object and the table—and
theorize that once started, the object would move across the table at constant
speed with no force applied. A steel ball bearing rolling on a hard horizontal
surface approaches this situation. So does a puck on an air table, in which a thin
layer of air reduces friction almost to zero.
It was Galileo’s genius to imagine such an idealized world—in this case, one
where there is no friction—and to see that it could lead to a more accurate and
richer understanding of the real world. This idealization led him to his remark-
able conclusion that if no force is applied to a moving object, it will continue to
move with constant speed in a straight line. An object slows down only if a
