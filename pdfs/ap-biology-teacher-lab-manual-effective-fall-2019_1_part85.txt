the population with a risk of 0.001% suffering from side effects, or no vaccine at all? 
Fresh vegetables sprayed with competing bacteria, or vegetables sprayed with sterilants 
that are hazardous to ecosystems? To risk conviction of a crime based on a detectiveâ€™s 
hunch, or to be acquitted based on evidence provided by DNA markers? These are 
routine questions affected by the use of mathematics in science, including biology, 
medicine, public health, and agriculture. 
To have a rich foundation in biology, your students need to apply quantitative 
methods to the study of biology. This is particularly true for a laboratory experience. 
Quantitative reasoning is an essential part of inquiry in biology. Many mathematical 
tools (e.g., statistical tests) were developed originally to work out biological problems. 
The pyramid of quantitative reasoning in biology (Figure 1), serves as a framework 
to help design curricula and
