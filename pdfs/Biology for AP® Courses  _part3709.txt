Figure 31.10 The mammalian circulatory system is divided into three circuits: the systemic circuit, the pulmonary
circuit, and the coronary circuit. Blood is pumped from veins of the systemic circuit into the right atrium of the
heart, then into the right ventricle. Blood then enters the pulmonary circuit, and is oxygenated by the lungs. From
the pulmonary circuit, blood re-enters the heart through the left atrium. From the left ventricle, blood re-enters the
systemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body. The coronary circuit, which provides
blood to the heart, is not shown.

Red blood cells lack nuclei at maturity and contain hemoglobin, which distributes oxygen throughout the
body. White blood cells are primarily inv
