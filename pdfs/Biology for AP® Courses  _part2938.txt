What is the role of microvilli in nutrient absorption?
a.
Microvilli form the inner layer of epithelial tissue in the small intestine and increase the absorption of
nutrients from chyme.
b.
Microvilli are projections of absorptive cells that are involved in the absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12.
c.
Microvilli increase the surface area of absorptive cells, and therefore increase the amount of nutrients that
can be absorbed.
d.
Microvilli use smooth muscle contractions to move the chyme, which contains nutrients, thereby increasing
the rate of absorption.
Large Intestine
The large intestine, illustrated in Figure 25.14, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the
waste material. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter.
It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch
