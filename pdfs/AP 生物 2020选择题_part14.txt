Pyruvate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is further metabolized in 
the Krebs cycle. A researcher measured the accumulation of acetyl-CoA in a reaction containing pyruvate and 
pyruvate dehydrogenase under several different conditions (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Accumulation of acetyl-CoA under different conditions

The lysosomes
(C)
The nucleus
(D) The mitochondrial matrix
6. The maximum production rate of acetyl-CoA
under condition 1 is closest to which of the

24 micromoles/sec
(C)
35 micromoles/sec
(D) 65 micromoles/sec
