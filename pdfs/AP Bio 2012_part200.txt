Characteristics of a 
STRONG Response
(Part a) The student is able write a coherent paragraph 
with appropriate terminology to correctly explain that 
p2 represents the frequency (proportion, percent) of the 
homozygous straight-wing individuals and that each has two 
copies of the dominant allele. The student also can correctly 
explain that q2 represents the frequency (proportion, 
percent) of the homozygous curly-wing individuals and 
that each has two copies of the recessive allele. Finally, 
the student can correctly explain that 2
