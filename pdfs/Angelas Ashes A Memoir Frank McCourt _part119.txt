is moaning in the bed. I think she’s sick. 
 
  
  
 Now Aunt Aggie comes grumbling.Ye are nothing but trouble 
 
 since ye came from America. 
 
 Leave him alone,Aggie, he’s only a child that’s doing what he’s told. 
 
 She tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the 
 
 morning not like some from the North that she won’t mention. He 
 
 says,No, no, I’m coming.There’s something wrong with Angela. 
 
 Dad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don’t know what’s 
 
 up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear 
 
 Aunt Aggie telling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and 
 
 Uncle Pa is out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what 
 
 you like about Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn’t talk to 
 
 my father, never looks at him. 
 
 Malachy says,Dad, is Mammy sick? 
 
 Och, she’ll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor. 
 
 I wonder what child is lost because we’re all here, one two three 
 
 four of us
