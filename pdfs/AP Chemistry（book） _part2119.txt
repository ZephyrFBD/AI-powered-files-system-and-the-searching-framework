1100 g2 = 0.773 K
A kelvin has the same size as a degree Celsius. 
 (Section 1.4) Because the solution temperature increases 
by 0.773 Â°C, the initial temperature was:
Chapter Summary and Key Terms
THE SOLUTION PROCESS (SECTION 13.1) Solutions form when 
one substance disperses uniformly throughout another. The attractive 
interaction of solvent molecules with solute is called solvation. When 
the solvent is water, the interaction is called hydration. The dissolution 
of ionic substances in water is promoted by hydration of the separated 
ions by the polar water molecules. The overall enthalpy change upon 
solution formation may be either positive or negative. Solution for-
mation is favored both by a positive entropy change, corresponding 
to an increased dispersal of the components of the solution, and by a 
negative enthalpy change, indicating an exothermic process.

Hence, the quantity of heat generated in forming the  
solution is:
