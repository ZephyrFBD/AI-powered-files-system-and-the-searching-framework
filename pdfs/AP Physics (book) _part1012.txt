g? (b) If the Tyrolean traverse is set up incorrectly
so that the rope sags by only one-fourth the distance found in
(a), determine the tension in the rope. Ignore stretching of
the rope. Will the rope break?

Problem 73.
75. A tightly stretched horizontal “high wire” is 36 m long. It
sags vertically 2.1 m when a 60.0-kg tightrope walker stands
at its center. What is the tension in the wire? Is it possible
to increase the tension in the wire so that there is no sag?
76. Parachutists whose chutes have failed to open have been
known to survive if they land in deep snow. Assume that a
75-kg parachutist hits the ground with an area of impact 
of 
at a velocity of 
and that the ultimate
strength of body tissue is
Assume that the
person is brought to rest in 1.0 m of snow. Show that the
person may escape serious injury.
77. If the left vertical support column in Example 9–5 is made
of steel, what is its cross-sectional area? Assume that a safety
factor of 3 was
