becomes positively charged. Because there is an opposite charge on the two elec-
trodes, there is a potential difference between the two terminals.
In a cell whose terminals are not connected, only a small amount of the zinc
is dissolved, for as the zinc electrode becomes increasingly negative, any new
positive zinc ions produced are attracted back to the electrode. Thus, a particular
potential difference (or voltage) is maintained between the two terminals. If charge
is allowed to flow between the terminals, say, through a wire (or a lightbulb),
then more zinc can be dissolved. After a time, one or the other electrode is used up
and the cell becomes “dead.”
The voltage that exists between the terminals of a battery depends on what the
electrodes are made of and their relative ability to be dissolved or give up electrons.
When two or more cells are connected so that the positive terminal of one is
connected to the negative terminal of the next, they are said to be connected
