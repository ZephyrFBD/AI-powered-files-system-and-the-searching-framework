modification‚Äù because
even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. This pattern repeats
over and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life:
1.
A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group.
2.
Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait.
3.
New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits.
4.
With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat).
If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the
organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait. The vertebrate in Figure 20.10 is a shared ancestral character. Now consider
the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure. Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those
that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait de
