Transcription
Transcription is the process by which the information in a DNA sequence
is copied (transcribed) into a complementary RNA sequence. Although
there are many kinds of RNA, three types are directly involved in protein
synthesis.
MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) IS INVOLVED IN TRANSCRIPTION: When a
sequence of DNA is expressed, one of two strands of DNA is
copied into mRNA according to the base-pairing rules: C with G
and A with U (in RNA, uracil replaces the thymine in DNA).
RIBOSOMAL RNA (rRNA) IS INVOLVED IN TRANSLATION: rRNA is
structural. Along with proteins, it makes up the ribosome, which
consists of two subunits, one large and one small. The ribosome
has one mRNA binding site and three tRNA binding
