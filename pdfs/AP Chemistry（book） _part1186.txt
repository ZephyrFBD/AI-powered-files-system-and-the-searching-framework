ergy: (a) Ti, Ba; (b) Ag, Cu; 
 
(c) Ge, Cl; (d) Pb, Sb.
 7.45  Write the electron configurations for the following ions, and 
determine which have noble-gas configurations: (a) Co2 +, 
(b) Sn2 +, (c) Zr4 +, (d) Ag+, (e) S2 -.
 7.46  Write the electron conﬁgurations for the following ions, and 
determine which have noble-gas conﬁgurations: (a) Ru3 +, 
(b) As3 -, (c) Y3 +, (d) Pd2 +, (e) Pb2 +, (f) Au3 +.
 7.47  Give three examples of ions that have an electron configura-
tion of nd 8 1n = 3, 4, 5, c2.
 7.48  Give three examples of ions that have an electron conﬁgura-
tion of nd 6 1n = 3, 4, 5, c2.
 7.49  Write an equation for the second electron affinity of chlo-
rine. Would you predict a positive or a negative energy value 
for this process? Is it possible to directly measure the second 
electron affinity of chlorine?
 7.50  If the electron affinity for an element is a negative number, 
does it mean that the anion of the element is more stable 
than the neutral atom? Explain.
