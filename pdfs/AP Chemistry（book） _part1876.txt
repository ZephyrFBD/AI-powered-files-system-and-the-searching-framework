forms 8 - N bonds, where N is the number of valence electrons. This 
behavior can easily be understood through the application of the octet rule.
If the 8 - N trend continued as we move left across the periodic table, we would 
expect aluminum (three valence electrons) to form five bonds. Like many other metals, 
however, aluminum adopts a close-packed structure with 12 nearest neighbors. Mag-
nesium and sodium also adopt metallic structures. What is responsible for this abrupt 
change in the preferred bonding mechanism? The answer, as noted earlier, is that met-
als do not have enough valence-shell electrons to satisfy their bonding requirements by 
forming localized electron-pair bonds. In response to this deficiency, the valence elec-
trons are collectively shared. A structure in which the atoms are close-packed facilitates 
this delocalized sharing of electrons.
