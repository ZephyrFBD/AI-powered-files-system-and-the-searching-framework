Human Impact on Ecosystems
Human activity damages the biosphere. Exponential population growth, destruction of habitats for agriculture and
mining, pollution from industry and transportation, and many other activities all contribute to the damage of the
environment. Some of the destructive consequences of human activity are summarized as follows:
1. Global climate change. The solar radiation that passes through the atmosphere consists mostly of visible light,
some shorter wavelength ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and some longer wavelength infrared radiation (heat). Some of
this solar radiation is reflected by the atmosphere back into space, while the remainder passes through the
atmosphere and is absorbed by the earth. The earth reemits some of the radiation back into the atmosphere, but as
longer-wavelength, infrared radiation. As the infrared radiation passes through the atmosphere on its
way out into space, it is absorbed b
