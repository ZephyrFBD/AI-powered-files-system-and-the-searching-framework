â–² Figure 14.5 Components of a spectrometer.
A variety of techniques can be used to monitor reactant and product 
concentration during a reaction, including spectroscopic methods, 
which rely on the ability of substances to absorb (or emit) light. Spec-
troscopic kinetic studies are often performed with the reaction mix-
ture in the sample compartment of a spectrometer, an instrument that 
measures the amount of light transmitted or absorbed by a sample at 
different wavelengths. For kinetic studies, the spectrometer is set to 
measure the light absorbed at a wavelength characteristic of one of 
the reactants or products. In the decomposition of HI1g2 into H21g2 
and I21g2, for example, both HI and H2 are colorless, whereas I2 is 
violet. During the reaction, the violet color of the reaction mix
