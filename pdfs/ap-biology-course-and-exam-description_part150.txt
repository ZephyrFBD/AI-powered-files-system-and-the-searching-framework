5.1
Think-Pair-Share  
Students can construct simulated chromosomes with pop beads or pipe cleaners and 
manipulate them through the stages of meiosis. As students are modeling the process, 
they can make a sketch or take a photograph of each stage. They should begin with either 
a 2n = 4 or a 2n = 6 “cell” so that they can build their understanding using a simpler system 
before applying what they have learned to meiosis in humans. This can be introduced or  
de-briefed using a Think-Pair-Share approach.

Construct an Argument  
Students can use genetic corn to apply the chi-square test to a dihybrid cross. First, 
students calculate the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios using a Punnett square. 
They then formulate null hypotheses for the
