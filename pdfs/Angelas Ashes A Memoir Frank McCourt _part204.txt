w the only part of the pig 
 
 the McCourts don’t ate? 
 
 No, I don’t, Christy. 
 
 The only part they don’t ate is the oink. 
 
 After a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone 
 
 can see the pig’s head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up 
 
 at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he’s dead and the world is 
 
 laughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone 
 
  
  
 laughed at them I’d hit them with a rock. 
 
 I wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every 
 
 few steps and lean against a wall. She’s holding her back and telling 
 
 us she’ll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he 
 
 wouldn’t be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, 
 
 packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity.That’s what he 
 
 says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the 
 
 Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig’s 
 
 head.
