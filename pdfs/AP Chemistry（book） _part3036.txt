to a highly organized biochemical sys-
tem, such as the nucleosome in the chapter-opening figure. We might expect that the 
creation of this well-ordered structure would lead to a decrease in the entropy of the 
system. But this is frequently not the case. Waters of hydration and counterions can be 
expelled from the interface as two large biomolecules interact, and so the entropy of 
the system can actually increase—if you consider the water and counterions to be part 
of the system.
The same ideas apply to chemical reactions. Consider the reaction between nitric 
oxide gas and oxygen gas to form nitrogen dioxide gas:
 
2 NO1g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 NO21g2 
[19.7]
which results in a decrease in the number of molecules—three molecules of gaseous 
reactants form two molecules of gaseous products (Figure 19.11). The formation of new 
N¬O bonds reduces the motions of the atoms in the system. The formation of new 
bonds decreases the number of degrees of freedom, or forms of motion, available to the
