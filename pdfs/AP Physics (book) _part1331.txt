is altered as we have seen (the Doppler effect); see
also Figs. 12–23a and b. But if a source of sound moves faster than the speed of
sound, a more dramatic effect known as a shock wave occurs. In this case, the
source is actually “outrunning” the waves it produces. As shown in Fig. 12–23c,
when the source is traveling at the speed of sound, the wave fronts it emits in the
forward direction “pile up” directly in front of it. When the object moves faster, at
a supersonic speed, the wave fronts pile up on one another along the sides, as shown
in Fig. 12–23d. The different wave crests overlap one another and form a single
very large crest which is the shock wave. Behind this very large crest there is 
usually a very large trough. A shock wave is essentially the result of constructive
interference of a large number of wave fronts. A shock wave in air is analogous
to the bow wave of a boat traveling faster than the speed of the water waves it
produces, Fig. 12–24.
