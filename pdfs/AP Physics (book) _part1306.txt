vered, the length of the vibrating air column
is the full length. The speed of sound in air at 20°C is 
Because a flute is
open at both ends, we use Fig. 12–11: the fundamental frequency 
is related 
to the length of the vibrating air column by

EXAMPLE 12;11
EXERCISE E To see why players of wind instruments “warm up” their instruments (so
they will be in tune), determine the fundamental frequency of the flute of Example 12–11
when all holes are covered and the temperature is 10°C instead of 20°C.
Wind noise frequencies. Wind can be noisy—
it can “howl” in trees; it can “moan” in chimneys. What is causing the noise, and
about what range of frequencies would you expect to hear?
APPROACH Gusts of air in the wind cause vibrations or oscillations of the tree
limb (or air column in the chimney), which produce sound waves of the same
frequency. The end of a tree limb fixed to the tree trunk is a
