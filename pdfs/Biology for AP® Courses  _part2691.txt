ade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched
light. The preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the Pr (inactive) form, slowing
growth. The nearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these
areas sense the red light, which activates the Pfr form and induces growth. In short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system
to grow away from shade and towards light. Because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the
evolutionary advantages of the phytochrome system are obvious.
In seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded). Instead,
is it used merely to determine if there is any light at all. This is especially important in species with very small seeds, such
as lettuce. Because of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves. Their seedlings cannot grow for l
