The animal cell would swell and may burst.
Hypertonic environment (e.g., plant is not watered)
(c) A plant cell is placed in a solution with higher water potential. Based on
the information, identify the state of the plant cell. (1 point)

Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
A plant cell placed in a solution with higher water potential will be turgid.
(d) Justify your conclusion. (1 point)
Justification (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
Since the solution has higher water potential than the plant cell, the solution
is hypotonic (lower solute concentration). This indicates that water will move
into the cell by osmosis from higher water potential to lower water potential
until the concentrations of solute equalize. This causes the cell to swell and
become turgid. The cell wall provides a barrier that prevents too much water
from moving into the cell.
The plant cell is turgid.
