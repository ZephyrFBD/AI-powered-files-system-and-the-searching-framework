might lie in the Influenza Neuraminidase (NA) protein. NA is an enzyme known to
play a role in releasing viral particles during viral spread. It functions by cleaving an attachment between viral
particles and the cell membrane. The researcher evaluated the enzyme activity of each of the strains and found
them to be quite different. She then compared the NA protein from the rapidly spreading strain of flu (NAH)
with the NA protein from another strain of flu (NAA). The sequences were similar, but there were some
differences in the amino acid sequence.

Figure 3. Neuraminidase activity of NAH and NAH with mutations
Point mutations were introduced in the nucleic acid sequence to modify the sequence of NAH to make it more
like NAA. The enzyme activity was assessed.
(a) Explain how changing a single nucleotide can change the sequence of the protein.
(b) Given what is known about the neuraminida
