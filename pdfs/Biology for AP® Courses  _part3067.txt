synapseâ€”most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.
Chemical Synapse
When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na+ channels.
Na+ ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane. This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca2+
channels to open. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles,
called synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Synaptic vesicles
are shown in Figure 26.14, which is an image from a scanning electron microscope.
Figure 26.14 This pseudocolored image taken with a scanning electron microscope shows an axon terminal that was
broken open to reveal synaptic vesicles (blue and orange) inside the neuron. (credit: modification of work by Tina
