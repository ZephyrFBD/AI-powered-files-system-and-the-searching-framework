represent pressure.
triple point is relatively high, 5.11 atm, CO2 does not exist as a liquid at 1 atm, which 
means that solid CO2 does not melt when heated, but instead sublimes. Thus, CO2 does 
not have a normal melting point; instead, it has a normal sublimation point, -78.5 °C. 
Because CO2 sublimes rather than melts as it absorbs energy at ordinary pressures, solid 
CO2 (dry ice) is a convenient coolant.

In 1888 Friedrich Reinitzer, an Austrian botanist, discovered that the organic compound 
cholesteryl benzoate has an interesting and unusual property, shown in Figure 11.31. 
Solid cholesteryl benzoate melts at 145 °C, forming a viscous milky liquid; then at 179 °C 
the milky liquid becomes clear
