d traits will be selected.
However, not every trait results because it is adaptive.
Traits that evolve by natural selection in one context but are then co-
opted for another purpose are called exaptations. For example, feathers
might have originally arisen as adaptations in the context of selection for
insulation, and only later were they co-opted for flight. In this case, the
general form of feathers is an adaptation for insulation and an exaptation
for flight.
HALF-LIFE
Being able to date fossils accurately is important for reconstructing the
history of life. One of the most common techniques to determine the
absolute (not errorless) age of a fossil is radiometric dating. It is based on
the half-life of radioisotopes. Half-life is the time required for half of the
nucleus of a radioactive sample to decay into its products. After one half-
life has passed, half the original material has decayed into atoms of a new
element. The other half of the element remains intact. Half-lives can b
