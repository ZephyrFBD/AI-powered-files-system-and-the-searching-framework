ids in a protein.
ii. Insertion or deletion of one nucleotide, or groups of nucleotides that are not divisible by three,
result in frameshift mutations—causing the reading frame (the coding region) to shift; this
mutation causes all the amino acids after the site of the mutation to also be altered.
iii. A frameshift mutation, especially near the start of the gene, almost always results in a completely
defective protein.
B. Mutations during Meiosis—mutations occurring during meiosis (as opposed to those that occur during
DNA replication) can involve parts of chromosomes or whole chromosomes.
1. Mutations in chromosome structure—where regions of DNA much larger than those involved in point
mutations are involved—are due to chromosome breakage.
i.
Deletion—occurs if a region of the chromosome (that does not contain a centromere) is broken and
does not rejoin the chromosome.
ii. Duplication—occurs if a broken portion of a chromosome becomes incorporated into its
homologous chromosome.
iii.
