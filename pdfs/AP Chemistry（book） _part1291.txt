 structures that contribute equally to the actual 
structure of the molecule.
The actual arrangement of the electrons in molecules such as O3 must be 
considered as a blend of two (or more) Lewis structures. By analogy to the green 
paint, the molecule has its own identity separate from the individual resonance 
structures. For example, the ozone molecule always has two equivalent O ¬O 
bonds whose lengths are intermediate between the lengths of an oxygen–oxygen 
single bond and an oxygen–oxygen double bond. Another way of looking at it is 
to say that the rules for drawing Lewis structures do not allow us to have a single 
dominant structure for the ozone molecule. For example, there are no rules for 
drawing half-bonds. We can get around this limitation by drawing two equivalent 
Lewis structures that, when averaged, amount to something very much like what is 
observed experimentally.
