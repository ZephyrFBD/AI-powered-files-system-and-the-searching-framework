lain why X rays can be used to measure atomic distances 
in crystals but visible light cannot be used for this purpose.

In their study of X-ray diffraction, William and Lawrence 
Bragg determined that the relationship among the wave-
length of the radiation 1l2, the angle at which the radi-
ation is diffracted 1u2, and the distance between planes of 
atoms in the crystal that cause the diffraction (d) is given by 
nl = 2d sin u. X rays from a copper X-ray tube that have a 
wavelength of 1.54 Ã… are diffracted at an angle of 14.22 de-
grees by crystalline silicon. Using the Bragg equation, cal-
culate the distance between the planes of atoms responsible 
for diffraction in this crystal, assuming n = 1 (first-order 
diffraction).

Germanium has the same structure as silicon, but the unit 
cell size is different because Ge and Si atoms are not the 
same size. If you were to repeat the experiment described 
in the previous problem but replace the Si crystal with a 
Ge cry
