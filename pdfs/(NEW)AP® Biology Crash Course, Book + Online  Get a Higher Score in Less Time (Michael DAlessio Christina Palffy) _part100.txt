Transcription
A. Transcription—the process whereby information contained in the nucleotide sequences of genes is
transferred to RNA molecules.
B. Transcription has three basic steps and occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotes and the cytoplasm of
prokaryotes:
1. Initiation—the initiation of transcription is controlled by interactions between various proteins and
various regions of a gene.
i.
During initiation, the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and opens a portion of the
gene to create a transcription bubble.
ii. RNA polymerase begins to synthesize an RNA transcript complementary to only one strand of
DNA called the template.
2. Elongation—during elongation, RNA polymerase moves along the template DNA, adding nucleotides
to the elongating strand of RNA.
i.
RNA polymerase catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond between each new nucleotide by
joining the ribose of one nucleotide to the phosphate of the other.
ii. Each incoming nu
