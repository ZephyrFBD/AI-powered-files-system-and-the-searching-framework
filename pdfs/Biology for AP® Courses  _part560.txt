iffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 5.8).
Diffusion expends no energy. On the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the
gradient is eliminated.
Figure 5.8 Diffusion through a permeable membrane moves a substance from an area of high concentration
(extracellular fluid, in this case) down its concentration gradient (into the cytoplasm). (credit: modification of work by

Each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of
the concentration gradients of other materials. In addition, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient. Within a
system, there will be different rates of diffusion of the different substances in the medium.
Factors That Affect Diffusion
Molecules move constantly in a random manner, at a rate that depends on their mass, their environment, and the amount
of thermal energy they po
