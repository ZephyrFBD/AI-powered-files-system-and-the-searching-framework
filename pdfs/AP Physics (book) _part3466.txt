mbine to form
larger ones with the release of energy: it is because the binding energy per
nucleon is less for light nuclei than it is for heavier nuclei (up to about 
).

month after the bomb was dropped
on Nagasaki. The shacks were
constructed afterwards from debris
in the ruins. The bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were each
equivalent to about 20,000 tons of
the common explosive TNT (

For two positively charged nuclei to get close enough to fuse, they must have very
high kinetic energy to overcome the electric repulsion. It is believed that many of
the elements in the universe were originally formed through the process of fusion
in
