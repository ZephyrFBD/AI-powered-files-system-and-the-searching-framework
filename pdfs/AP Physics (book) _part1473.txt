 the Moon is about one-fifth what
it is for the Earth, due to the Moon’s smaller mass. Explain
why the Moon has practically no atmosphere. (b) If hydro-
gen was once in the Earth’s atmosphere, why would it 
have probably escaped?
18. What exactly does it mean when we say that oxygen boils
at
19. A length of thin wire is placed over a block of ice (or an ice
cube) at 0°C. The wire hangs down both sides of the ice,
and weights are hung from the ends of the wire. It is found
that the wire cuts its way through the ice cube, but leaves a
solid block of ice behind it. This process is called regelation.
Explain how this happens by inferring how the freezing
point of water depends on pressure.
20. (a) Why does food cook faster in a pressure cooker?
(b) Why does pasta or rice need to boil longer at high alti-
tudes? (c) Is it harder to boil water at high altitudes?
21. Is it possible to boil water at room temperature (20°C)
without heating it? Explain.
22. Why does exhaled air appear as a littl
