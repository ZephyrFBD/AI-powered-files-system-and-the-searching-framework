tree, the “tree of life” has a single trunk and many branches. (credit b: modification of work by "Amada44"/Wikimedia

Limitations to the Classic Model
Classical thinking about prokaryotic evolution, included in the classic tree model, is that species evolve clonally. That is,
they produce offspring themselves with only random mutations causing the descent into the variety of modern-day and
extinct species known to science. This view is somewhat complicated in eukaryotes that reproduce sexually, but the laws of
Mendelian genetics explain the variation in offspring, again, to be a result of a mutation within the species. The concept of
genes being transferred between unrelated species was not considered as a possibility until relatively recently. Horizontal
gene transfer (HGT), also known as lateral gene transfer, is the transfer of genes between unrelated species. HGT has been
shown to be an ever-present
