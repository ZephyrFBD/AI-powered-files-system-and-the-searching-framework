n bubbles that change the buoyancy of the disk, eventually causing them 
to rise. 
Students should develop the skills necessary to implement the selected procedure 
so that they can explore their own questions about photosynthesis in Designing and 
Conducting Your Investigation. Procedure serves as a structured inquiry that is a 
prerequisite for open inquiry into the variables that may affect photosynthesis. 
First, during class discussions, students consider a number of variables that might 
affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants â€” both physical variables and biotic variables. 
Likewise, students consider variables that might affect the floating disk procedure itself. 
These variables are compiled and categorized to serve as a guide for student questions 
and experimental design, as illustrated in Table 1.

affect photosynthesis but a
