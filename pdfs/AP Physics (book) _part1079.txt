FIGURE 10–28 Rear of the head and
shoulders showing arteries leading to
the brain and to the arms. High blood
velocity past the constriction in the
left subclavian artery causes low
pressure in the left vertebral artery,
in which a reverse (downward) blood
flow can then occur, resulting in a
TIA, a loss of blood to the brain.

Why does smoke go up a chimney? It’s partly because hot air rises (it’s less
dense and therefore buoyant). But Bernoulli’s principle also plays a role. When wind
blows across the top of a chimney, the pressure is less there than
