ade up
of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex, giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally. There are
two types of nephrons—cortical nephrons (85 percent), which are deep in the renal cortex, and juxtamedullary nephrons
(15 percent), which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. A nephron consists of three parts—a renal corpuscle,
a renal tubule, and the associated capillary network, which originates from the cortical radiate arteries.

in the kidney cortex, while collecting ducts are located in the pyramids of the medulla. (credit: modification of work
