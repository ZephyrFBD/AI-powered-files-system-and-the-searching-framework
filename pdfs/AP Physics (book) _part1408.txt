 a lake would
cause severe damage to its plant and animal life. Because of the unusual behavior
of water below 4°C, it is rare for any large and deep body of water to freeze
completely, and this is helped by the layer of ice on the surface which acts as an
insulator to reduce the flow of heat out of the water into the cold air above. Without
this peculiar but wonderful property of water, life on this planet as we know it
might not have been possible.
Not only does water expand as it cools from 4°C to 0°C, it expands even more
as it freezes to ice. This is why ice cubes float in water and pipes break when water
inside them freezes.
Thermal Stresses
In many situations, such as in buildings and roads, the ends of a beam or slab of
material are rigidly fixed, which greatly limits expansion or contraction. If the
temperature should change, large compressive or tensile stresses, called thermal
stresses, will occur. The magnitude of such stresses can be calculated using the
concept of elastic
