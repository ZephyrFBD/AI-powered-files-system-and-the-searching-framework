▶Practice Exercise 2
Since the entropy of the universe increases for spontaneous 
processes, does it mean that the entropy of the universe 
decreases for nonspontaneous processes?
In each pair, choose the system that has greater entropy and explain your choice: (a) 1 mol of NaCl(s) or 1 mol of HCl(g) at 25 °C, 
(b) 2 mol of HCl(g) or 1 mol of HCl(g) at 25 °C, (c) 1 mol of HCl(g) or 1 mol of Ar(g) at 298 K.
Sample Exercise 19.4 
Predicting Relative Entropies
SOLUTION
Analyze We need to select the system in each pair that has the 
greater entropy.
Plan We examine the state of each system and the complexity of 
the molecules it contains.
Solve (a) HCl(g) has the higher entropy because the particles in  
gases are more disordered and have more freedom of motion than 
the particles in solids. (b) When these two systems are at the  
same pressure, the sample containing 2 mol of HCl has twice the 
number of molecules as the sample containing 1 mol. Thus,
