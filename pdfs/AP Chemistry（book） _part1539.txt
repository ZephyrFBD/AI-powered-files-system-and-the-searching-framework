 bond enthalpies (Table 8.3) of the carbon–
carbon single, double, and triple bonds to deduce an aver-
age p@bond contribution to the enthalpy. What fraction of 
a single bond does this quantity represent? (b) Make a sim-
ilar comparison of nitrogen–nitrogen bonds. What do you 
observe? (c) Write Lewis structures of N2H4, N2H2, and N2, 
and determine the hybridization around nitrogen in each 
case. (d) Propose a reason for the large difference in your 
observations of parts (a) and (b).

Use average bond enthalpies (Table 8.3) to estimate ∆H for 
the atomization of benzene, C6H6:
C6H61g2 ¡ 6 C1g2 + 6 H1g2
 
 
Compare the value to that obtained by using ∆Hf° data 
given in Appendix C and Hess’s law. To what do you attri-
bute the large discrepancy in the two values?
 
[9.119]  Many compounds of the transition-metal elements con-
tain direct bonds between metal atoms. We will assume 
that the z-axis is defined as the metal–metal bond axis.
