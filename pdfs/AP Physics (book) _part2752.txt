24–10 Polarization
60. (I) Two polarizers are oriented at 72° to one another.
Unpolarized light falls on them. What fraction of the light
intensity is transmitted?
61. (I) What is Brewster’s angle for an air–glass
surface?
62. (II) At what angle should the axes of two Polaroids be
placed so as to reduce the intensity of the incident unpo-
larized light to (a)

75. Red light from three separate sources passes through a
diffraction grating with 
The wave-
lengths of the three lines are 
(hydrogen),
(neon), and 
(argon). Calculate
the angles for the first-order diffraction line of each source.
76. What is the index of refraction of a clear material if a
minimum thickness of 125 nm, when laid on glass, is needed
to reduce reflection to nearly zero when light of 675 nm is
incident normally upon it? Do you have a choice for an
answer?
77. Light of wavelength 650 nm passes through two narrow
sl
