 particles, and bacteria that can damage
the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses. The respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid
problems or tissue damage. In the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap small particles, viruses, bacteria, dust, and dirt to
prevent their entry.
If particulates do make it beyond the nose, or enter through the mouth, the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain
several protective devices. The lungs produce mucus—a sticky substance made of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, as well
as salts and water—that traps particulates. The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line
the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles (Figure 30.11). These cilia beat in unison and move mucus and particles out of the
bronchi and bronchioles back up to the throat where it is swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus.
In humans, for example, tar and other substances in cigarette smoke destroy or paralyze the cilia, ma
