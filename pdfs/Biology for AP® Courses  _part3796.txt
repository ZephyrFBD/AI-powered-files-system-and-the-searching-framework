the blood; and secretion,
in which additional wastes and H+ are added to urine to maintain homeostatic pH. The processes of diffusion, osmosis, and
active transport ensure that the urine excreted from the body is hypertonic, thus preventing dehydration. For example, water
is reabsorbed throughout nephron tubules back into capillaries via osmosis, and in another part of the tubule (ascending
loop of Henle), Na+ and Cl– are actively transported into the interstitial fluid.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP®
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP® exam
questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science practices.
