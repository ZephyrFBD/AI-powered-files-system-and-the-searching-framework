s from your skin, a large amount of heat is
taken with it and you are cooled (“evaporative cooling”). When water changes physical states, from solid to liquid or
liquid to gas, energy is absorbed but the water temperature remains constant. The absorbed energy is used only to
change the physical state of the water by breaking the hydrogen bonds that tether the water molecules together. In
the reverse reactions, from gas to liquid or liquid to solid, the energy released reestablishes the hydrogen bonds. In
Figure 2-3, the horizontal lines between the physical states of water indicate the absorption of energy without a rise
in temperature. The energy associated with each of these transitions has a special name:
Heat of fusion is the energy required to change water from a solid to a liquid.
Heat of vaporization is the energy required to change water from a liquid to a gas.
