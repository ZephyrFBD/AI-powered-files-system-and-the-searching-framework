hemical reactions by lowering activation energy (that is, the energy 
needed for a reaction to begin). In every chemical reaction, the starting materials (the 
substrate(s) in the case of enzymes) can take many different paths to forming products. 
For each path, there is an intermediate or transitional product between reactants and 
final products. The energy needed to start a reaction is the energy required to form that 
transitional product. Enzymes make it easier for substrates to reach that transitional 
state. The easier it is to reach that state, the less energy the reaction needs. 
Enzymes are biological catalysts. They are large protein molecules, folded so that they 
have very specifically shaped substrate binding sites. These binding sites make substrates 
go into the transition state. To catalyze the reaction, several regions of the binding site 
must be precisely positioned around the substrate molecules. Any change in the shape of 
the overall folded enzyme molecule can c
