ute and pressure potentials are zero (ψS = 0; ψP = 0). An increase in positive pressure 
raises the pressure potential and the water potential. The addition of solute to the water 
lowers the solute potential and therefore decreases the water potential. This means that a 
solution at atmospheric pressure has a negative water potential because of the solute. 
The solute potential (ψS) = – iCRT, where i = the ionization constant, C = the molar 
concentration, R = the pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter bars/mole-K), and T = the 
temperature in K (273 + °C).

and 25°C has an 
osmotic potential of -3.7 bars and a water potential of -3.7 bars. A bar is a metric 
measure of pressure and is the same as 1 atmosphere at sea level. A 0.15 M NaCl solution 
contains 2 ions, Na+ and Cl-; therefore i = 2, and the water potential = -7.4 bars.
