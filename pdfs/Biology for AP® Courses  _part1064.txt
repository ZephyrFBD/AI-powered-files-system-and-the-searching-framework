roduces the luminescent luciferase enzyme, so bacteria living outside the squid do not luminesce.
c.
The ability to luminesce does not benefit free-living bacteria, so free-living bacteria do not produce
luciferase.
d.
Luciferase is toxic to free-living bacteria, so free-living bacteria do not produce this enzyme.
Research on the details of quorum sensing has led to advances in growing bacteria for industrial purposes. Recent
discoveries suggest that it may be possible to exploit bacterial signaling pathways to control bacterial growth; this process
could replace or supplement antibiotics that are no longer effective in certain situations.
