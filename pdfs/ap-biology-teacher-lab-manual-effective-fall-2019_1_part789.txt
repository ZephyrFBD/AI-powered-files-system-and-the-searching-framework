•  In Procedure 1, was the limiting factor of your base line reaction the enzyme or the 
substrate? How could you modify the procedure you learned to answer this question? 
If students are not able to think this through on their own, remind them that in 
an enzymatic reaction a “fit” of the substrate and enzyme must be accomplished. The 
reaction is dynamic and requires the two to join together. Whichever material is present 
in smaller amount will thus determine the rate of the reaction. Therefore, students 
simply would perform two tests varying the substrate in one while keeping the enzyme 
the same and the reverse in the other. Remember, the volume must always be the same; 
thus, if students reduced the enzyme by 0.5 mL, they would have to increase the distilled 
water by 0.5 mL. In another test they would modify the hydrogen peroxide in a similar 
manner. 
•  What are three or four factors that vary in the environment in which organisms live?
