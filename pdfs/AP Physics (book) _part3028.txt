in the everyday world. We apply the
concepts of waves and particles to light because in the macroscopic world we see
that energy is transferred from place to place by these two methods. We cannot
see directly whether light is a wave or particle, so we do indirect experiments. To
explain the experiments, we apply the models of waves or of particles to the
nature of light. But these are abstractions of the human mind. When we try to
conceive of what light really “is,” we insist on a visual picture. Yet there is no
reason why light should conform to these models (or visual images) taken from
the macroscopic world. The “true” nature of light—if that means anything—is
not possible to visualize. The best we can do is recognize that our knowledge is
limited to the indirect experiments, and that in terms of everyday language and
images, light reveals both wave and particle properties.
It is worth noting that Einstein’s equation 
itself links the particle
and wave properties of a light beam. In
