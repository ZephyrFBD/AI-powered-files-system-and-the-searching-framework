ons involving 
the care and safety of laboratory organisms. Some states have rigorous guidelines, 
such as not using vertebrate animals for experiments in the classroom. You should 
demonstrate a respect for all life and insist that your students do the same. 
•  Access to materials and equipment: Students may need to coordinate the sharing of 
materials and equipment, and/or coordinate with the teacher for access to specialized 
equipment. Also, they may need to understand the permutations of a student-directed 
lab, and the need for variations in materials. 
You must also model the actions and behavior expected of students (e.g., wear safety
