By using quantum mechanical methods analogous to those used for atoms in 
Section 6.5, we can calculate the distribution of electron density in molecules. Such 
a calculation for H2 shows that the attractions between the nuclei and the electrons 
cause electron density to concentrate between the nuclei, as shown in Figure 8.7(b). 
As a result, the overall electrostatic interactions are attractive. Thus, the atoms in 
H2 are held together principally because the two positive nuclei are attracted to the 
concentration of negative charge between them. In essence, the shared pair of elec-
trons in any covalent bond acts as a kind of “glue” to bind atoms together.
