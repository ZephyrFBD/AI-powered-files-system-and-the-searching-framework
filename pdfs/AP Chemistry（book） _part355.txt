 molecular formula, which gives the ac-
tual numbers of each type of atom in a molecule. Structural formulas 
  
show the order in which the atoms in a molecule are connected. 
 
Ball-and-stick models and space-filling models convey additional 
 
information about the shapes of molecules.
IONS AND IONIC COMPOUNDS (SECTION  2.7) Atoms can either 
gain or lose electrons, forming charged particles called ions. Metals tend 
to lose electrons, becoming positively charged ions (cations). Nonmetals 
tend to gain electrons, forming negatively charged ions (anions). Because 
ionic compounds are electrically neutral, containing both cations and an-
ions, they usually contain both metallic and nonmetallic elements. At-
oms that are joined together, as in a molecule, but carry a net charge are 
called polyatomic ions. The chemical formulas used for ionic compounds 
are empirical formulas, which can be written readily if the charges of the 
ions are known. The total positive charge of the cations i
