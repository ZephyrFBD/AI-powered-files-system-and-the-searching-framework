ns in the plasma membrane. There are several kinds of
these proteins. Channel proteins provide passage for certain dissolved substances. Transport proteins actively
transport substances against a concentration gradient. The extracellular matrix in animal cells, consisting of the
polysaccharides of glycolipids, recognition proteins, and other glycoproteins, provides adhesion or participates in
cell-to-cell interactions. Receptor proteins recognize hormones and transmit their signals to the interior of the cell.
Various substances can be exported into the external environment by exocytosis. In exocytosis, substances are
packaged in vesicles that merge with the plasma membrane. Once they merge with the membrane, their contents are
released to the outside. In an opposite kind of procedure, food and other substances can be imported by endocytosis.
In endocytosis, the plasma membrane encircles the substance and encloses it in a vesicle.
