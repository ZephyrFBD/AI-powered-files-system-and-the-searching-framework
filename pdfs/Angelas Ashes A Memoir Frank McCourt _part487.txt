nd God knows we wouldn’t know ourselves with the money 
 
 pouring in. She wouldn’t be happy if we grew up with English accents 
 
 but better an English accent than an empty belly. 
 
 Bridey says it doesn’t matter what class of an accent an Irishman has

 We know what Saturdays are in the lane.We know some families 
 
 like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. 
 
 Downes is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a 
 
 Friday and go home to his bed.We know men like him run to the post 
 
 office the minute they’re paid so their families won’t know a minute of 
 
 waiting or worry. Men like Mr.Downes send their sons RAF wings to 
 
 wear on their coats.That’s what we want and that’s what we told Dad 
 
 before he left, Don’t forget the RAF badges, Dad. 
 
 We see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. 
 
 They’re happy telegram boys
