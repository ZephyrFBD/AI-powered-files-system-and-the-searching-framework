 fruit before it is ripe and spray it with
ethylene gas when the fruit gets to market to ripen it.
Tropisms
A tropism is the growth of a plant toward or away from a stimulus.
Examples are thigmotropisms (touch), geotropisms or gravitropisms
(gravity), and phototropisms (light). A growth of a plant toward a
stimulus is known as a positive tropism, while a growth away from a
stimulus is a negative tropism.
Phototropisms result from an unequal distribution of one category of
plant hormones called auxins, which accumulate on the side of the plant
away from the light. Since auxins cause growth, the cells on the shady side
of the plant enlarge and the stem bends toward the light.
Geotropisms result from an interaction of auxins and statoliths,
specialized plastids that contain dense starch grains.
Photoperiodism
Plants detect the presence of light as well as its direction, intensity, and
wavelength. The environmental stimulus a plant uses to detect the time of
year is the photoperiod, the re
