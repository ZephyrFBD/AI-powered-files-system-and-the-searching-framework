ly and (b) iso-
thermally. In each process, does the entropy increase,
decrease, or stay the same? Explain.
17. Which do you think has the greater entropy, 1 kg of solid
iron or 1 kg of liquid iron? Why?
18. Give three examples, other than those mentioned in this
Chapter, of naturally occurring processes in which order
goes to disorder. Discuss the observability of the reverse
process.
19. Entropy is often called “time’s arrow” because it tells us 
in which direction natural processes occur. If a movie 
were run backward, name some processes that you might
see that would tell you that time was “running backward.”
20. Living organisms, as they grow, convert relatively simple
food molecules into a complex structure. Is this a violation
of the second law of thermodynamics? Explain your answer.
1. In an isobaric compression of an ideal gas,
(a) no heat flows into the gas.
(b) the internal energy of the gas remains constant.
(c) no work is done on the gas.
(d) work is done on the gas.
(e) w
