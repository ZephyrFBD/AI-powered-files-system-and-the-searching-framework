onments because they are more likely to contain some individuals who can withstand the changing
environmental pressures. Less genetically diverse populations are at a greater risk for declines in population sizes or
extinction.
Ecological stresses created by human activities, such as habitat destruction or overhunting, can increase
extinction rates. Some scientists hypothesize that Earth is currently experiencing a sixth major extinction event
caused by human activities.
Species diversity depends on a balance between rates of speciation and extinction. If speciation rates are greater
than extinction rates, species diversity will increase. If extinction rates exceed speciation rates, species diversity will
decrease. While extinction may have negative consequences, extinction can also clear available habitats and niches
for other species.
Modern-Day Examples of Continuing Evolution
Life on Earth continues to evolve in Earthâ€™s changing environment. Populations evolve when the conditions i
