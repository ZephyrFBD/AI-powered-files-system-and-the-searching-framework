ility and Ksp. 
Starting from the mass solubility, follow the green arrows to determine 
Ksp. Starting from Ksp, follow the red arrows to determine either molar 
solubility or mass solubility.
The solubility of a substance can change considerably in 
response to a number of factors. For example, the solubilities of 
 
hydroxide salts, like Mg1OH22, are dependent upon the pH of 
the solution. The solubility is also affected by concentrations 
of other ions in solution, especially common ions. In other 
words, the numeric value of the solubility of a given solute does 
change as the other species in solution change. In contrast, the 
solubility-product constant, Ksp, has only one value for a given 
solute at any specific temperature.* Figure 17.16 summarizes the 
relationships among various expressions of solubility and Ksp.
In principle, it is possible to use the Ksp value of a salt to cal-
culate solubility under a variety of conditions. In practice, great 
care must be taken in doing
