on. Oxygen is not
required in glycolysis, so choice (A) is incorrect. Oxygen is not required for fermentation nor is it a substrate for
enzymes used in fermentation, so choice (C) is incorrect. Pyruvate does not enter the matrix of the
mitochondria, so choice (D) is incorrect.
18. (C) During the Krebs cycle, NAD+ is reduced to NADH, so this is a relevant question in understanding the
Krebs cycle. The breakdown of glucose into pyruvate occurs during glycolysis, not the Krebs cycle, so choice
(A) is incorrect. The proton gradient in the mitochondria is formed during oxidative phosphorylation, not the
Krebs cycle, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because the formation of ATP by ATP synthase
happens during chemiosmosis, not the Krebs cycle.
19. (B) Both fermentation and the electron transport chain oxidize NADH to NAD+. Choice (A) is incorrect
because fermentation does not require oxygen. Fermentation occurs in the cytoplasm, not the mitochondria, so
choice (C) is incorr
