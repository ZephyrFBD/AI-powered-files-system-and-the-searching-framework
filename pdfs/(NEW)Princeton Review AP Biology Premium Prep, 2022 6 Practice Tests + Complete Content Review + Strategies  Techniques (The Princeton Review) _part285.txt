Remember:
Diploid refers to any cell that has two sets of chromosomes.
Haploid refers to any cell that has one set of chromosomes.
Why do we need to know the terms haploid and diploid? Because they are extremely important when it comes to
sexual reproduction. As weâ€™ve seen, 46 is the normal diploid number for human beings, but there are only 23
different chromosomes. The duplicate versions of each chromosome are called homologous chromosomes. The
homologous chromosomes that make up each pair are similar in size and shape and contain the same genes in the
same locations (although they might have different versions of those genes). This is the case in all sexually
reproducing organisms. In fact, this is the essence of sexual reproduction: each parent donates half its chromosomes
to its offspring.
Gametes
Although most cells in the human body are diploid, there are special cells that are haploid. These haploid cells are
called sex cells, or gametes. Why do we have haploid
