es a net  
attraction 
that is smaller than it would experience in the absence of other electrons.
How can we account for the combination of nuclear attraction and electron repul-
sions for our electron of interest? The simplest way to do so is to imagine that the  
electron 
experiences a net attraction that is the result of the nuclear attraction decreased by the 
electronâ€“electron repulsions. We call this partially screened nuclear charge the effective 
nuclear charge, Zeff. Because the full attractive force of the nucleus has been decreased 
by the electron repulsions, we see that the effective nuclear charge is always less than the 
actual nuclear charge 1Zeff 6 Z2. We can define the amount of screening of the nuclear 
charge quantitatively by using a screening  
constant, S, such that
 
Zeff = Z - S 
[7.1]
where S is a positive number. For a valence electron, most of the shielding is due to the 
core electrons, which are much closer to the nucleus. As a result, for the valence el
