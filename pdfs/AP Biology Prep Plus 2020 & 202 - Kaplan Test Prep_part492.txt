ile a somatic cell contains the resources necessary to divide an
unlimited amount of times during its lifetime, it is limited by its own
DNA. Each time DNA is replicated, tiny bits of the protective regions on
the end, known as telomeres, become degraded. AÈ‡er approximately
52 divisions, these regions are completely degraded, triggering the cell
to enter apoptosis. However, cancer cells are able to divide
continuously and without a limit because they make a protein known
as telomerase that regenerates the protective ends of DNA. This best
matches (D). (A) is incorrect because DNA is not reversibly modified
during replication; it is permanently degraded. (B) is incorrect
because, like all cells, cancer cells have to enter interphase to allow
their DNA to replicate, prior to dividing. (C) is incorrect because
normally, except in a few specific types of cells, a complete copy of
genetic information is passed on to both daughter cells. In the cells
where this does occur, it is unlikely tha
