79. A tuning fork is set into vibration above a vertical open
tube filled with water (Fig.12–40). The water level is allowed
to drop slowly.As it does so, the air in the tube above the water
level is heard to resonate with the
tuning fork when the distance from
the tube opening to the water level
is 0.125 m and again at 0.395 m.
What is the frequency of the
tuning fork?

82. A particular whistle produces sound by setting up the 
fundamental standing wave in an air column 7.10 cm long.
The tube is closed at one end. The whistle blower is riding

83. The diameter D of a tube does affect the node at the open
end of a tube. The end correction can be roughly approxi-
mated as adding 
to to give us an effective length for
the tube in calculations. For a closed tube of length 0.55 m
and diameter 3.0 cm, what are the frequencies of the first
four harmonics, taking the en
