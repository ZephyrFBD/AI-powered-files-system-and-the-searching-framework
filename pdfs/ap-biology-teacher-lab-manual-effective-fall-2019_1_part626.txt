y productivity of Wisconsin 
Fast Plants growing under lights, and (2) the flow of energy from the plants to cabbage 
white butterflies as the larvae consume cabbage-family plants. These two exercises describe 
methods for estimating energy flow in a terrestrial ecosystem, and students are asked to 
apply the skills they acquire, including converting biomass measurements to energy units. 
Students record their questions and observations as they work through the investigation. 
Questions might include What is the role of energy in ecosystems? What factors affect plant 
productivity, the growth of cabbage white larvae, and the interactions of the organisms? 
How can energy be tracked in the model system? and Can the data collecting techniques be 
improved? The study of these model organisms and methods for estimating energy flow 
create a rich, accessible environment that facilitates student exploration of basic ecological 
concepts with respect to energy flow, the roles of producers and
