The nature of the rock that contains the groundwater has a large influence on 
the water’s chemical composition. If minerals in the rock are water soluble to some 
extent, ions can leach out of the rock and remain dissolved in the groundwater. 
Arsenic in the form of HAsO4
2-, H2AsO4
-, and H3AsO3 is found in many groundwater

Human Activities  
and Water Quality
All life on Earth depends on the availability of suitable water. Many human activi-
ties entail waste disposal into natural waters without any treatment. These practices 
result in contaminated water that is detrimental to both plant and animal aquatic 
life. Unfortunately people in many parts of the world do not have access to water 
that has been tre
