Convex rearview mirror. An external rearview car mirror
is convex with a radius of curvature of 16.0 m (Fig. 23–20). Determine the loca-
tion of the image and its magnification for an object 10.0 m from the mirror.
APPROACH We follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy explicitly.
SOLUTION
1. Draw a ray diagram. The ray diagram will be like Fig. 23–19b, but the large
object distance 
makes a precise drawing difficult. We have a
convex mirror, so r is negative by convention.
2. Mirror and magnification equations. The center of curvature of a convex mir-
ror is behind the mirror, as is its focal point, so we set
so that
the focal length is
The object is in front of the mirror,
Solving the mirror equation, Eq. 23–2, for 
gives
Thus
Equation 23–3 gives the magnification
3. Sign conventions. The image distance is negative,
so the image is
behind the mirror. The magnification is
so the image is upright
