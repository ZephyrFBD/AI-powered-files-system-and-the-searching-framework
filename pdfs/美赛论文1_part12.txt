matrixs

T T T  are consistent. Otherwise, we also need to revise them. 
In order to calculate the consistency of the matrix, we introduce an index that 
determines the consistency:

n
CI
n
λ −

, where n stands for the dimension of the 
matrix, λ stands for the maximum of the eigenvalues of the matrix. Besides, we 
introduce the index RI  that determines the random of the consistency to balance the 
influence of CI .
