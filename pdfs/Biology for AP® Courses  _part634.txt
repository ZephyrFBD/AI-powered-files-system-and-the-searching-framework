ers
containing ATP, ouabain (or oubain), Na+ , and K+
in
varying combinations inside and outside of the cell as
indicated in the chart. The transport of Na+
and K+
was measured to determine activity of the Na+ / K+
pump. Which of the following conclusions is supported by
the data?
a.
Ouabain can disrupt ATP binding to the
Na+ / K+
pump.
b.
ATP is required for transport of Na+
and not
for transport of K+ .
c.
The ATP binding site of the Na+ / K+
pump
is located on the intracellular domain of the
pump.
d.
The ATP binding site of the Na+ / K+
pump
is located on the extracellular domain of the
pump.

Paramecia are unicellular protists that have contractile
vacuoles to remove excess intracellular water. In an
experimental investigation, Paramecia were placed in salt
solutions of increasing osmolarity. The rate at which a
Paramecium's contractile vacuole contracted to pump out
excess water was determined and plotted against
osmolarity of the solutions, as shown in the graph. Which
of the
