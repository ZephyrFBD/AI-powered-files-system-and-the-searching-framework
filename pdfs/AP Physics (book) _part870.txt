 wheel? If the angular acceleration
points east, describe the tangential linear acceleration of this
point at the top of the wheel. Is the angular speed increasing
or decreasing?
*19. In what direction is the Earth’s angular velocity vector as it
rotates daily about its axis, north or south?
*20. On the basis of the law of conservation of angular momen-
tum, discuss why a helicopter must have more than one
rotor (or propeller). Discuss one or more ways the second
propeller can operate in order to keep the helicopter stable.

rod?
1. A bicycle odometer (which counts revolutions and is cali-
brated to report distance traveled) is attached near the
wheel axle and is calibrated for 27-inch wheels. What 
happens if you use it on a bicycle with 24-inch wheels?
2. Suppose a disk rotates at constant angular
