re of C would be available for
conversion to J (and then to K and L), and as C increases, the rate of production of J increases. Eventually, the rate
of production of D would equal the rate of the reverse reaction (of D to C), and chemical equilibrium between C and
D would be reached (the net rate of production of D would be zero).
3. D. The effect of the allosteric effector E is to inhibit enzyme C′. As quantities of product E accumulate, increasing
amounts of C′ would become inactivated. As a result, fewer and fewer quantities of C would be converted to
products D and J. Thus, the rate of production of D and J, as well as E, K, and L, would decrease. As quantities of C
increase, the rate of the reverse reaction of C to B (and then to A) would increase. In the end, A, B, and C would be
in chemical equilibrium, and the rate of production of products D, E, J, K, and L would be zero.
4. B. Glucose is a monomer consisting of a single glucose molecule. Starch and cellulose are polymers con
