Noyce. Tiny amounts of impurities can be inserted or injected at particular loca-
tions within a single silicon crystal or wafer. These can be arranged to form diodes,
transistors, resistors (undoped semiconductors), and very thin connecting “wires”
which are heavily doped thin lines. Capacitors and inductors 
can also be formed, but also can be connected separately. Integrated circuits are
the heart of computers, televisions, calculators, cameras, and the electronic
instruments that control aircraft, space vehicles, and automobiles.
A tiny chip, a few millimeters on a side, may contain billions of transistors
and other circuit elements. The number of 
has been doubling every
2 or 3 years. We often hear of the technology generation, which is a number that
refers to the minimum width of a conducting line (“wire”). The gate of a MOSFET
may be even smaller. Since 2003 we have passed from 90-nm technology to 65-nm,
to 45-nm, to 32-nm, to 22-nm, every 2 to 3 ye
