t necessarily indicate what you predict will occur.
Support a claim: Explain how evidence given or calculated supports a claim.
3. Look for biology terms in the prompt. These terms are important to determine the answer. For
example, if two “species” are mentioned, likely your knowledge of what a species is, is what is being
sought. Other common terms to look for are “energy,” “photosynthesis,” “ATP,” “structure and
function,” “prokaryotic,” “eukaryotic,” and “molecular level.”
4. Reread your answers if you have time. Make sure your responses address each task verb and
demonstrate a clear understanding of any biology terms in the prompt.
