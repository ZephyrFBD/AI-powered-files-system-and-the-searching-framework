or Al21SO423. A 
friend suggests that you test a portion of the solution with 
Ba1NO322 and then with NaCl solutions. According to your 
friend’s logic, which of these chemical reactions could oc-
cur, thus helping you identify the solution in the bottle? 
 
(a) Barium sulfate could precipitate. (b) Silver chloride 
could precipitate. (c) Silver sulfate could precipitate. 
 
(d) More than one, but not all, of the reactions described in 
answers a–c could occur. (e) All three reactions described in 
answers a–c could occur.
 4.30 Three solutions are mixed together to form a single solution; 
 
in the final solution, there are 0.2 mol Pb1CH3COO)2, 
0.1 mol Na2S, and 0.1 mol CaCl2 present. What solid(s) will 
precipitate?
