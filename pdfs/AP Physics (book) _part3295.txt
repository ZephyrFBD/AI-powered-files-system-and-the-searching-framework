to the conduction and valence bands of inorganic silicon diodes (Fig. 29–28).
Holes travel in the HOMO, electrons in the LUMO. (“Orbital” is a chemistry
word for the states occupied by the electrons in a molecule.)

When electrons and holes meet near the junction (Fig. 29–38), they can form
a sort of bound state (like in the hydrogen atom) known as an exciton. An exciton
has a small binding energy (0.1 to 1 eV), and a very short lifetime on the order 
of nanoseconds. When an exciton “decays” (the negative electron and positive
hole combine), a photon is emitted. These photons are the useful output.
The energy hf of the photon, and its frequency corresponding to the 
color, depends on the energy structure of the exciton. The energy gap,
LUMO–HOMO, sets an upper limit on hf, but the vibrational energy levels of
the molecules reduce that by varying amounts, as does the binding energy of the
exciton. The
