B
Glycolysis results in the production of ATP (energy), so it is considered an exergonic process.

B
Thermophilic bacteria live in hot environments. Also, a DNA polymerase replicates DNA. Therefore, in the
PCR technique, the stage in which DNA is elongated by a DNA polymerase is part three of the cycle, at 72°C.
Therefore, bacteria growing in hydrothermal vents between 70–75°C is the answer. The conditions described
in (A) and (D) do not reflect the data, which focuses on temperature. Choice (C) describes hot springs, but the
temperature does not reflect the enzyme activity most likely for Taq polymerase.
8.
D
The free energy does not change between catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions; therefore, (A) is incorrect.
Choice (B) is a correct statement, but it does not answer the question. Choice (C) is incorrect because enzymes
catalyze reactions.

B
ATP production will increase in the treated mitochondria because the low pH provides more H+ ions in the
solution. Also, oxygen provides
