year. Not surpris-
ingly, chemists and chemical engineers are actively searching for improved catalysts 
for the Haber process. A breakthrough in this field would not only increase the supply 
of ammonia for fertilizers, it would also reduce the global consumption of fossil fuels 
in a significant way.

What quantity dictates the speed of a reaction: (a) the energy difference 
between the initial state and the transition state or (b) the energy difference 
between the initial state and the final state?

Catalyzed reaction 
proceeds more rapidly.
The two reactions reach the 
same equilibrium mixture, 
but the catalyzed reaction 
achieves equilibrium faster.
Catalyzed reaction has 
lower activation energy.
