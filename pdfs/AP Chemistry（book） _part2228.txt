4.3 to estimate the half-life for this reaction. (b) Use 
the half-life from (a) to calculate the rate constant.
Sample Exercise 14.9
 Determining the Half-Life of a First-Order Reaction
SOLUTION
Analyze We are asked to estimate the half-life of a reaction from a 
graph of concentration versus time and then to use the half-life to 
calculate the rate constant for the reaction.
Plan
(a) To estimate a half-life, we can select a concentration and then 
determine the time required for the concentration to decrease 
to half of that value.
(b) Equation 14.17 is used to calculate the rate constant from the 
half-life.
Solve
(a) From the graph, we see that the initial value of 3C4H9Cl4 is 
0.100 M. The half-life for this ﬁrst-order reaction is the time 
required for 3C4H9Cl4 to decrease to 0.050 M, which we can 
read off the graph. This point occurs at approximately 340 s.
(b) Solving Equation 14.17 for k, we have
k = 0.693
t1>2
= 0.693
340 s = 2.0 * 10-3 s-1
