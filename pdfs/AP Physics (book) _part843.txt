phere rolling down an incline. What will be the speed
of a solid sphere of mass M and radius R when it reaches the bottom of an
incline if it starts from rest at a vertical height H and rolls without slipping?
See Fig. 8–23. (Assume sufficient static friction so no slipping occurs: we will
see shortly that static friction does no work.) Compare your result to that for an
object sliding down a frictionless incline.
APPROACH We use the law of conservation of energy with gravitational poten-
tial energy, now including rotational kinetic energy as well as translational KE.
SOLUTION The total energy at any point a vertical distance y above the base
of the incline is
where v is the speed of the center of mass, and Mgy is the gravitational potential
energy. Applying conservation of energy, we equate the total energy at the top
to the total energy at the bottom
