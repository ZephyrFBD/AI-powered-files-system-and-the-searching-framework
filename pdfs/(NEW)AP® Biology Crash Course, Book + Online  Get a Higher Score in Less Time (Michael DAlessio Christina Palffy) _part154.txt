lowest trophic level of food
chains.
A more stable climate may lead to a greater number of niches available for exploitation.
Tropical communities are older than those farther from the equator because they were not
destroyed by recent ice ages.
Species Richness and Distance from Equator
2. The species-area effect shows that species richness increases as the number of habitats and the area
they cover increases. Therefore, larger islands have more species than smaller islands, and a reduction
in habitat area is a main cause of the extinction of populations.
3. A keystone predator may increase species richness by preying on a successful competitor, thereby
reducing competition between the prey species and its closest competitors and allowing those
competitor populations to thrive.
Species Diversity with and without a Keystone Predator
B. Communities with greater species richness are more stable in the face of disturbances—such as droughts,
floods, and other natural disasters—because a gre
