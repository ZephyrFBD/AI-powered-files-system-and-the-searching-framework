elerate upward). For the elevator,
which must have greater magnitude
than 
so that 
accelerates downward. Thus our calculation must give 
between 9800 N and 11,300 N.
SOLUTION (a) To find 
as well as the acceleration a, we apply Newtonâ€™s
second law,
to each object. We take upward as the positive y direc-
tion for both objects. With this choice of axes,
because 
accelerates
upward, and
because 
accelerates downward. Thus
We can subtract the first equation from the second to get
where a is now the only unknown. We solve this for a:
The elevator 
accelerates downward (and the counterweight 
upward) at
(b) The tension in the cable 
can be obtained from either of the two
equations at the start of our solution, setting 
:
or
which are consistent. As predicted, our result lies between 9800 N and 11,300 N.
NOTE We can check our equation for the acceleration a in this Example by
noting that if the masses were equal  
then our equation above for a
would give  
as we should expect. Also, if one o
