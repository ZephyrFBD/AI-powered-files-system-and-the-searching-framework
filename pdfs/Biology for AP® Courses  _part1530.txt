 results from this
supercoiling. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent the helix from re-forming.
Primase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter DNA strand.
On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in
short stretches called Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals
the gaps between the Okazaki fragments, joining the fragments into a single DNA molecule. (credit: modification
of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
You isolate a cell strain in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has
occurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?
a.
DNA ligase
b.
DNA polymerase III
c.
helicase
d.
topoisomerase
The replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase can only extend in the
