 the high temp, they won’t have a cell cycle, and then when they shift to the lower
temperature, it will begin to grow and the cell cycle will continue.
Question 4
a. Describe what happened to the biodiversity of the ecosystem before and after the fire.
The biodiversity of the ecosystem increased following the fire.
b. Explain your description in (a) using Simpson’s Diversity Index.
Before the fire:
Insect
n
n/N
(n/N)2
Hazel-hued bugs
​ ​ 3
3/44 = 0.068
0.004624
Hairy bear moths

14/44 = 0.318
0.101124
Telluride tiger beetles
​ ​ 6
6/44 = 0.136
0.018496
Golden-winged butterflies
21
21/44 = 0.477
0.227529
D = 0.004624 + 0.101124 + 0.018496 + 0.227529 = 0.351773
Simpson’s Diversity Index = 1 – D = 0.648227
After the fire:
