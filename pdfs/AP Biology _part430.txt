Figure 11.2 Three Types of Selection
SP 3
Be able to describe a model (graph) that represents evolution within a population.
1. Stabilizing Selection
Stabilizing selection, sometimes called purifying selection, eliminates the
extremes and favors the more common intermediate forms. Many mutant
forms are weeded out in this way.
In humans, stabilizing selection keeps the majority of birth weights
in the 6–8 pound (2.7–3.6 kg) range. For babies much smaller and
much larger, infant mortality is greater.
In Swiss starlings, genotypes that lead to a clutch size (the number
of eggs a bird lays) of up to five will have more surviving young
than birds of the same species that lay a larger or smaller number of
eggs.
2. Disruptive or Diversifying Selection
Disruptive or diversifying selection increases the extreme types in a
population at the expense of intermediate forms. What may result is called
balanced polymorphism: one population divided into tw
