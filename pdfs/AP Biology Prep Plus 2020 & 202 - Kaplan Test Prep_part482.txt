ither the S or M phases. Furthermore, if the
chromosomes did become unstable, then both daughter cells would
be aﬀected because the new chromosomes contain both old and
newly synthesized strands of DNA. (D) assumes that because the two
phases are drawn to the same proportion, they are exactly the same,
even though the question stem states that the lengths in the figure are
only “roughly proportional” to the relative durations of these stages.
(D) also ignores the various mechanisms that cells possess to regulate
the cell cycle, including checkpoints, cyclin-dependent kinases, and
other cell signaling factors. (B) correctly describes the purpose of G1
and G2 (first and second Gap phases) with an appropriate description
of the activities taking place within a cell during that stage.

DNA synthesis is a necessary step in the cell cycle of a mitotically
dividing cell, and epithelial cells are a common example of mitotically
dividing cells (only a few types of c
