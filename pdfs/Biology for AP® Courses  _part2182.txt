selection that favors phenotypes that are either common (positive frequency-
dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection)

all of the alleles carried by all of the individuals in the population
effect of chance on a populationâ€™s gene pool
distribution of the different possible genotypes in a population
diversity of alleles and genotypes in a population
the proportion of a specific genotype in a population relative to all other genotypes for those genes
that are present in the population
