 which aﬀects the structure of the
hemoglobin β subunit and in turn hemoglobin’s function. The correct answer is (D). (A) is
incorrect because the point mutation causes a change in the amino acid sequence and
therefore would have an eﬀect on the structure of hemoglobin. (B) is incorrect because
the mutation in the 20th nucleotide does translate to an amino acid, so it will not stop the
formation of hemoglobin. (C) is incorrect because substituting glutamic acid with valine
will create nonfunctional hemoglobin.
44. B
Unlike point mutations, which substitute a base in the DNA sequence and result in
changing one amino acid, frameshiȇ mutations can cause a change in multiple amino
acids. Insertions and deletions shiȇ the reading of the codons (sequence of three
DNA/RNA nucleotides) aȇer the mutation, thereby altering the amino acid sequence. The
correct answer is (B). Proteins created by frameshiȇ mutations may be abnormally short
or long and may be beneficial, non-functional, or lethal. (
