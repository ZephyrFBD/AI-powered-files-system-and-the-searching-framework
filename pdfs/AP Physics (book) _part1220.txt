t as well, and when we discuss light, we shall find Eq.11–20 very useful.

1–14 Diffraction
Waves spread as they travel. When waves encounter an obstacle, they bend around
it somewhat and pass into the region behind it, as shown in Fig. 11–45 for water
waves. This phenomenon is called diffraction.
The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave and on the
size of the obstacle, as shown in Fig. 11–46. If the wavelength is much larger than
the object, as with the grass blades of Fig. 11–46a, the wave bends around them
almost as if they are not there. For larger objects, parts (b) and (c), there is more
of a “shadow” region behind the obstacle where we might not expect the waves
to penetrate—but they do, at least a little. Then notice in part (d), where the
obstacle is the same as in part (c) but the wavelength is longer, that there is more
diffraction into the shadow region. As a rule of thumb, only if the wavelength
is smaller than the size of the object will there be a
