FAUSTUS. When I behold the heauens," &c.
The lines which I have here omitted belong to a subsequent part of the
play, where they will be found with considerable additions, and are rightly
assigned to the CHORUS.  (As given in the present place by the 4tos
1616, 1624, 1631, these lines exhibit the text of the earlier FAUSTUS; see
p. 90, sec. col.) It would seem that something was intended to intervene
here between the exit of Faustus and Mephistophilis, and their re-
appearance on the stage:  compare, however, the preceding play, p. 88,
first col.
<p. 90, sec. col. (Doctor Faustus, from the quarto of 1604):
    "FAUSTUS. Great thanks, mighty Lucifer! This will I keep as
chary as my life.
LUCIFER. Farewell, Faustus, and think on the devil.
FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer. [Exeunt LUCIFER and
BELZEBUB.]
Come, Mephistophilis. [Exeunt.]
