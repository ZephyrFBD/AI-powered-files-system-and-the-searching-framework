ing constant of
the bond is unchanged (sulfur is just below oxygen in the
Periodic Table). Predict the frequency after the sulfur 
substitution.
70. A rectangular block of wood floats in a calm lake. Show
that, if friction is ignored, when the block is pushed 
gently down into the water and then released, it will then
oscillate with SHM. Also, determine an equation for the
force constant.
f = 3.7 * 1013 Hz.

General Problems
56. (II) In Problem 55 (Fig.11â€“55), the length of the string may
be adjusted by moving the pulley. If the hanging mass m is
fixed at 0.080 kg, how many different standing wave patterns
may be achieved by varying between 10 cm and 1.5 m?

Oscillations and Waves
71. A 320-kg wooden raft floats on a lake. When a 68-kg man
stands on the raft, it sinks 3.5 cm deeper into the water.
When he steps off, the raft oscillates for a while. (a) What
is the frequency of oscillation? (b) What is the total energy
of osci
