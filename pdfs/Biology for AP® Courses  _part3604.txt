 have a ‘flow-through
respiratory system,’” and how does this aid in flight?
a.
The “flow-through respiratory system” allows air to only entirely in one direction, without retracing its
pathway at all, allowing the animal to breathe faster while in flight
b.
The “flow-through respiratory system” contains several air sacs that make the animal lighter compared to
similar-sized animals with no air sacs.
c.
The “flow-through respiratory system” contains many lungs, which allow the animals to take in the large
quantities of oxygen needed for flight.
d.
The “flow-through respiratory system” allows air to move in an almost unidirectional pathway to reach
a series of air sacs that provide air to hollow bones, making the animals lighter and providing efficient
respiration.
All mammals have lungs that are the main organs for breathing. Lung capacity has evolved to support the animal’s activities.
During inhalation, the lungs expand with air, and oxygen diffuses across the lung’s surface and ente
