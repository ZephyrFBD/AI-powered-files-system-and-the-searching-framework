e heart, the left lung is smaller and has only two lobes.
In the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages, or bronchi. Air enters the lungs through the two primary
(main) bronchi (singular: bronchus). Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which
in turn divide, creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung. Like the
trachea, the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. At the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic
fibers. Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control
muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous
systemâ€™s cues. In humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles. They lack
cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape. As the passageways decrease in diameter, th
