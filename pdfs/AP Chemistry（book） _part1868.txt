ed by the area of the unit cell, times 
100%. What is the packing efficiency for a square lattice for at-
oms of radius a/2 that are centered at the lattice points?  
(a) 3.14% (b) 15.7% (c) 31.8% (d) 74.0% (e) 78.5%
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Determine the packing efficiency by calculating the fraction 
of space occupied by atoms in a body-centered cubic metal.
Give It Some Thought
For metallic structures, does the packing efficiency (see Sample Exercise 12.1) 
increase or decrease as the number of nearest neighbors (the coordination number) 
decreases?
