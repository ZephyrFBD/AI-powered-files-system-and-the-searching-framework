 repair mechanism. When
these patients are exposed to UV light, thymine
dimers are formed and they are not able to repair
this defect. These dimers distort the structure of
DNA and cause them to have a high risk of
contracting skin cancer.
b.
Xeroderma Pigmentosa patients can employ the
nucleotide excision repair mechanism. When
these patients are exposed to UV light, the
thymine dimers are formed and they are able to
repair this defect. These dimers do not distort the
structure of DNA and they have moderate risk of
contracting skin cancer.
c.
Xeroderma Pigmentosa patients cannot employ
the nucleotide excision repair mechanism. When
these patients are exposed to UV light, the
adjacent adenine forms dimers and they are not
able to repair this defect. These dimers distort
the structure of DNA and they have high risk of
contracting skin cancer.
d.
Xeroderma Pigmentosa patients cannot employ
the nucleotide excision repair mechanism. When
these patients are exposed to UV light, the
adjacent
