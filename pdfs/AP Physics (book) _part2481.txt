The transmitting TV camera can be seen in the Chapter-Opening
photo, page 625. At that time, someone pointed out that Columbus and other
early navigators could have imagined that humans might one day reach the
Moon. But they would never have believed possible that moving images could be
sent from the Moon to the Earth through empty space.

James Clerk Maxwell synthesized an elegant theory in which
all electric and magnetic phenomena could be described using
four equations, now called Maxwell’s equations. They are based
on earlier ideas, but Maxwell added one more—that a changing
electric field produces a magnetic field.
Maxwell’s theory predicted that transverse electromagnetic
(EM) waves would be produced by accelerating electric charges,
and these waves would propagate (move) through space at the
speed of light:

The oscillating electric and magnetic fields in an EM wave
are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propa-
gation. These EM waves are waves
