CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTIONS—Guess now!
1. You revolve a ball around you in a hori-
zontal circle at constant speed on a string,
as shown here from above. Which path will
the ball follow if you let go of the string
when the ball is at point P?
2. A space station revolves around the Earth
as a satellite, 100 km above Earth’s surface.
What is the net force on an astronaut at rest
inside the space station?
(a) Equal to her weight on Earth.
(b) A little less than her weight on Earth.
(c) Less than half her weight on Earth.
(d) Zero (she is weightless).
(e) Somewhat larger than her weight on Earth.
A
n object moves in a straight line if the net force on it acts along the direction
of motion, or the net force is zero. If the net force acts at an angle to the
direction of motion at any moment, then the object moves in a curved path.
An example of the latter is projectile motion, which we discussed in Chapter
