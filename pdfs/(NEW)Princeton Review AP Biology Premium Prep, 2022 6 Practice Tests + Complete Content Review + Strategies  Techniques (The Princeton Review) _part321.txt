 of increased storage material in the cells,
presumably because the lysosomes arenâ€™t working properly. What is a valid explanation as to why parents of
children with this devastating disease can be completely normal?
(A) Parents of the autosomal recessive disease must both be carriers of the mutation on the CLN3 gene.
(B) Carriers of the CLN3 mutation genotype do not show the phenotype because one normal CLN3 allele is
present to provide a functioning CLN3 protein.
(C) Redundant proteins take over the function of the mutant CLN3 protein in the parents.
(D) X inactivation prevents expression of the CLN3 mutated protein in the parents.
8. A breeder of black Labrador puppies notices that in his line a gene predisposing his dogs for white spots has
arisen. He believes the white spot allele is autosomal recessive, and he wants to prevent it from continuing in
his dogs. He sees that one of his female dogs, Speckle, has white spots, and he therefore assumes she is
homozygous for the gene. But
