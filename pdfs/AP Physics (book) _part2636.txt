CHAPTER 24
Wave fronts can be used to explain how mirages are produced by refraction
of light. For example, on a hot day motorists sometimes see a mirage of water on
the highway ahead of them, with distant vehicles seemingly reflected in it
(Fig. 24–4a). On a hot day, there can be a layer of very hot air next to the roadway
(made hot by the Sun beating down on the road). Hot air is less dense than
cooler air, so the index of refraction is slightly lower in the hot air. In Fig. 24–4b,
we see a diagram of light coming from one point on a distant car (on the right)
heading left toward the observer. Wave fronts and two rays (perpendicular to the
wave fronts) are shown. Ray A heads directly at
