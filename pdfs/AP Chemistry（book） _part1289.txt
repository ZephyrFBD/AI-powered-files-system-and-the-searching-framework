se each oxygen atom contributes 6 valence electrons, the 
ozone molecule has 18 valence electrons. This means the Lewis structure must 
have one O ¬O single bond and one O “O double bond to attain an octet about 
each atom:

However, this single structure cannot by itself be dominant because it requires that 
one O ¬O bond be different from the other, contrary to the observed structure—we 
would expect the O “O double bond to be shorter than the O ¬O single bond. In 
drawing the Lewis structure, however, we could just as easily have put the O “O 
bond on the left:
There is no reason for one of these Lewis structures to be dominant because they 
 
are equally valid representations of the molecule. The placement of the atoms in 
these two alternative but completely equivalent Lewis structures is the same, but 
the placement of the electrons is different; we call Lewis structures of this sort res-
onance structures. To describe the structure of ozone properly, we wr
