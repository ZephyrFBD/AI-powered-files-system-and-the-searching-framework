. With increasing industrialization, smoke and soot polluted the
environment, making all the plants and rocks dark. By 1900, all
moths in the industrialized regions were dark; only a few light-
colored individuals could be found. Before the industrial revolution,
white moths were camouflaged in their environment and dark
moths were easy prey for predators. After the environment was
darkened by heavy pollution, dark moths were camouflaged and
had the selective advantage. Within a relatively short time, dark
moths replaced the light moths in the population.
Directional selection can produce rapid shifts in allelic
frequencies. For example, soon after the discovery of antibiotics,
bacteria appeared that were resistant to these drugs. Scientists now
know that the genes for antibiotic resistance are carried on
plasmids, small DNA molecules, which can be transferred from
one bacterial cell to another and which can spread the mutation for
antibiotic resistance very rapidly within the bacteria
