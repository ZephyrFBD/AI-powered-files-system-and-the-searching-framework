ach point in the rotating object.
Each point in a rotating object may also have translational velocity and acceleration,
but they have different values for different points in the object.
When an object such as the bicycle wheel in Fig. 8â€“3 rotates from some 
initial position, specified by 
to some final position,
its angular displacement
is
The angular velocity (denoted by 
the Greek lowercase letter omega) is
defined in analogy with linear (translational) velocity that was discussed in 
Chapter 2. Instead of linear displacement, we use the angular displacement. Thus
the average angular velocity of an object rotating about a fixed axis is defined as
(8;2a)
where 
is the angle through which the object has rotated in the time interval 
The instantaneous angular velocity is the limit of this ratio as 
approaches zero:
(8;2b)
Angular velocity is generally specified in radians per second (rad/s). Note that all
points in a rigid object rotate with the same angular velocity, since every posi
