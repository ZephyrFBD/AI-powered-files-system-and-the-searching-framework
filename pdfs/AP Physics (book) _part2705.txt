ssing through is reduced by half
because half the light is eliminated:
(Fig. 24–42).
When two Polaroids are crossed—that is, their polarizing axes are perpendicular
to one another—unpolarized light can be entirely stopped. As shown in Fig.24–43,
unpolarized light is made plane-polarized by the first Polaroid (the polarizer).
The second Polaroid, the analyzer, then eliminates this component since its trans-
mission axis is perpendicular to the first.
