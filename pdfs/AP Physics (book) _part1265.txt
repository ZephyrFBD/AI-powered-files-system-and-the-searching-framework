nts originates in 
longitudinal standing waves of an air column.
Percussion instruments create more 
complicated standing waves.
Besides examining sources of sound, we 
also study the decibel scale of sound level,
sound wave interference and beats, the 
Doppler effect, shock waves and sonic booms,
and ultrasound imaging.

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A pianist plays the note “middle C.” The sound is made by the vibration of the
piano string and is propagated outward as a vibration of the air (which can reach
your ear). How does the vibration on the string compare to the vibration in the air?
(a) The vibrati
