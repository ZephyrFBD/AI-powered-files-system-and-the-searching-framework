tions from a
common point, it is called divergent evolution. Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs
of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in
different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (Figure 18.5).
Figure 18.5 Flowering plants evolved from a common ancestor. Notice that the (a) dense blazing star (Liatrus spicata)
and the (b) purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) vary in appearance, yet both share a similar basic morphology.

In other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species. For example, flight has evolved in both
bats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. However, the wings
of bats and insects have evolved from very different original struct
