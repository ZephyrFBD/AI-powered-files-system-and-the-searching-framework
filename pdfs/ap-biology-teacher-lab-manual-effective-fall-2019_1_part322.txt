 of water will cause the cell 
membrane to shrink away from the cell wall, and the cell will plasmolyze.

•  Calculate the solute potential of a 0.1 M NaCl solution at 25°C. If the concentration 
of NaCl inside the plant cell is 0.15 M, which way will the water diffuse if the cell is 
placed into the 0.1 M NaCl solutions? 
•  What must the turgor pressure equal if there is no net diffusion between the solution 
and the cell? 
■ Learning Objectives 
•  ENE-1.B: Explain the effect of surface area-to-volume ratios on the exchange of 
materials between cells or organisms and the environment. 
•  ENE-1.C: Explain how specialized structures and strategies are used for the efficient 
exchange of molecules to the environment. 
•  ENE-2.H: Explain how concentration gradients affect the movement of molecules 
across membranes 
■ General Safety Precautions 
You must wear safety glasses or goggles, aprons, and gloves b
