 reaction without itself undergoing any net change. In con-
trast, Br2 is an intermediate because it is first formed (Equation 14.32) and then con-
sumed (Equation 14.33). The color change we see in Figure 14.22 illustrates that the 
presence of intermediates can in some cases be readily detected. Neither the catalyst 
nor the intermediate appears in the equation for the overall reaction. Notice, how-
ever, that the catalyst is present at the start of the reaction, whereas the intermediate is 
formed during the course of the reaction.
How does a catalyst work? If we think about the general form of rate laws 1Equa-
tion 14.7, rate = k3A4m3B4n2, we conclude that the catalyst must affect the numerical 
value of k, the rate constant. On the basis of the Arrhenius equation (Equation 14.21, 
k = Ae-Ea>RT2, k is determined by the activation energy 1Ea2 and the frequency factor 1A2. 
 
A catalyst may affect the rate of reaction by altering the value of either Ea or A. We can 
envision this hap
