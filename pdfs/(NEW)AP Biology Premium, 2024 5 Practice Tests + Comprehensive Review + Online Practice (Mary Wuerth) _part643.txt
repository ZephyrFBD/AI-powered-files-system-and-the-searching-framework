mmonly used antibiotic, interferes with bacterial ribosomes. Which process would most
likely be negatively affected by streptomycin?

43. A scientist is studying a eukaryotic gene that is 15,000 base pairs long. The scientist isolates the mRNA
(produced by this gene) from the cytosol and finds that it is only 12,000 base pairs long. Why is the isolated
mRNA not the same length as the DNA that codes for it?
(A) The scientist made a mistake and isolated the wrong mRNA.
(B) Introns are removed from eukaryotic mRNAs, so the mRNA is shorter than the DNA.
(C) RNA is less stable than DNA and is more likely to degrade in the cell.
(D) The poly-A tail on the mRNA results in an mRNA that is shorter than the gene.
