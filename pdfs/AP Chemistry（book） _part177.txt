ates the difference between these two concepts.
In the laboratory, we often perform several “trials” of an experiment and average the 
results. The precision of the measurements is often expressed in terms of the standard 
deviation (Appendix A.5), which reflects how much the individual measurements differ 
from the average. We gain confidence in our measurements if we obtain nearly the same 
value each time—that is, when the standard deviation is small. Figure 1.24 reminds us, 
High precision can be achieved on a scale 
like this one, which has 0.1 mg accuracy.

tortuous path that takes the scientist from promising beginnings to a 
much desired goal.
