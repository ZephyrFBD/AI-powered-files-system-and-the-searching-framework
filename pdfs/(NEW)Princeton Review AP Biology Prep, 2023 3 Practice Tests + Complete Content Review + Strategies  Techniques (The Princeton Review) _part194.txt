Cilia and Flagella
Cilia and flagella are threadlike structures best known for their locomotive properties in single-celled organisms.
The beating motion of cilia and flagella structures propels these organisms through their watery environments.
The two classic examples of organisms with these structures are the Euglena, which gets about using its whiplike
flagellum, and the Paramecium, which is covered in cilia. The rhythmic beating of the Paramecium’s cilia enables it
to motor about in waterways, ponds, and microscope slides in your biology lab. You may have seen these in lab, but
here’s what they look like:
Though we usually associate such structures with microscopic or unicellular organisms, they aren’t the only ones
with cilia and flagella. As you probably know, these structures are also found in certain human cells. For example,
the cells lining your respiratory tract possess cilia that sweep constantly back and forth (beating up to 20 times
