s are also important to
understanding how a specific population will grow.
Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. These are grouped into density-dependent factors, in which
the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density-independent factors, which
influence mortality in a population regardless of population density. Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the
population depends on the density of the population at onset. Conservation biologists want to understand both types because
this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.

Density-dependent Regulation
Most density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition,
accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its
mortality rate. For example, d
