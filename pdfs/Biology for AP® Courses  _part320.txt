 in Figure 3.28) has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function.
Specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in the β chain. What is most remarkable to consider is
that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids.
The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and
a sickle cell molecule—which dramatically decreases life expectancy—is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more
remarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base
change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases.
Figure 3.28 The beta chain of hemoglobin is 147 residues in length, yet a single amino acid substitution leads to
sickle cell anemia. In normal hemoglobin, the amino acid at position seven is glutamate. In sickle cell hemoglobin, this
