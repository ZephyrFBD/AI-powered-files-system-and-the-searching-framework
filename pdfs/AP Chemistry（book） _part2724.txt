OH completely reacts with the 5.00 * 10-3 mol 
of CH3COOH to form 5.00 * 10-3 mol of CH3COONa. The Na+ ion of this salt has 
no significant effect on the pH. The CH3COO- ion, however, is a weak base whose 
Hence, the concentration of OH-1aq2 in the 
flask is:
3OH-4 =

= 0.10 * 10-3 mol
0.1010 L
= 1.0 * 10-3 M
and we have:
 pOH = -log11.0 * 10-32 = 3.00
 pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 3.00 = 11.00
Comment Note that the pH increased by only two pH units, from 
1.00 (Figure 17.7) to 3.00, after the first 49.0 mL of NaOH solution 
was added, but jumped by eight pH units, from 3.00 to 11.00, as 
2.0 mL of base solution was added near the equivalence point. 
Such a rapid rise in pH near the equivalence point is a characteris-
tic of titrations involving strong acids and strong bases.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
An acid–base titration is performed: 250.0 mL of an unknown 
concentration of HCl (aq) is titrated to the equivalence point 
with 36.7 mL of a 0.1000 M aqueous solutio
