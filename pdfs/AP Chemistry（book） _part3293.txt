 20.10  The electrodes in a silver oxide battery are silver oxide 
1Ag2O2 and zinc. (a) Which electrode acts as the anode? 
(b) Which battery do you think has an energy density most 
similar to the silver oxide battery: a Li-ion battery, a nickel–
cadmium battery, or a lead–acid battery? [Section 20.7]
 20.11  Bars of iron are put into each of the three beakers as shown 
here. In which beaker—A, B, or C—would you expect the 
iron to show the most corrosion ? [Section 20.8]
