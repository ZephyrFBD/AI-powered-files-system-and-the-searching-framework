 O’Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils. 
 
 Well, then, Mr. O’Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. 
 
 The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth.The geometry is 
 
 mine.Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long 
 
 division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don’t want

 him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. 
 
 Tell him Euclid is mine,Mr. O’Halloran, or I’ll put a stop to his gallop. 
 
 Mr.O’Halloran tells Mr. O’Dea to return to his classroom and asks 
 
 Mr. O’Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O’Halloran says, Now, Mr.
