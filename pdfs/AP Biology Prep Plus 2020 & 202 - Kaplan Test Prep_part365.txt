at a pH of 7.75?

The reaction rate would be lower, regardless of how the
reaction rate compared with the maximum possible rate.
(A)
The reaction rate would be higher unless the reaction was
already at the maximum rate for that pH.
(B)
Because the reaction rate at a pH of 7.75 appears to be
unusually favorable, the reaction rate probably cannot
increase further if substrate is added.
(C)
Because the reaction rate at a pH of 7.75 is lower than the
maximum rate shown at a pH of 7.25, the reaction rate will
increase back to the maximum of 1.

3. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is an enzyme that
can use NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor. The table shows the Km and
kcat/Km of a wild type and mutant version of G6PDH. The Km
represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate
is half of the maximum rate. kcat/Km i
