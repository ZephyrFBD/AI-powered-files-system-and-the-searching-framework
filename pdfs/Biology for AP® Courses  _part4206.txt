 a seasonal loss of leaves associated with variations in temperature and sunlight;
these forests are “evergreen” year-round.
The temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes,
with the temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 34 °C (68 °F to 93 °F). When one compares the annual temperature variation
of tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest
becomes apparent. This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and
fall) growth seen in other biomes. In contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short
days during the yearly cycle. Instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (11–12 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation,
thereby, a longer period of time for plant growth.
The annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 to 660 cm (50–200 i
