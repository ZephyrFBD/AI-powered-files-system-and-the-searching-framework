The cell of the unicellular algae Ventricaria ventricosa is
one of the largest known, reaching one to five centimeters
in diameter. Like all single-celled organisms, V. ventricosa
exchanges gases across the cell membrane. What
adaptations would V. ventricosa likely have evolved
related to its large size and ability to exchange materials
with the outside environment?

adaptations that would decrease cell metabolism
to meet the needs of the large cell
b.
adaptations that woul
