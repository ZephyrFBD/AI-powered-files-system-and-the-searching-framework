d.
(C)	 Because increasingly complex forms of chlorophyll are found in red algae, 
brown algae, green algae, and flowering plants, respectively, this reflects the 
order of their appearance.
(D)	Because all of the organisms contain chlorophyll a, the organisms share a 
common ancestor.
10.	 A student used a microscope to observe a wet-mount slide of red onion 
epidermal cells that were suspended in a 1% NaCl solution. The student 
then added a 15% NaCL  solution to the slide and observed the changes that 
occurred. The student’s observations are represented in Figure 1.

Which of the following most directly explains the changes in the cells?
(A)	The degradation of DNA in the nuclei of the cells
(B)	 The lysis of chloroplasts in the cells
(C)	 The movement of water from the central vacuoles of the cells into  
the solution
