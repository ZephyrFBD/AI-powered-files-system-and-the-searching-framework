 564 nm. 12.113 (a) Zinc sulﬁde, ZnS (b) covalent (c) In the 
solid, each Si is bound to four C atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement, 
and each C is bound to four Si atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement, 
producing an extended three-dimensional network. SiC is high-
melting because melting requires breaking covalent Si¬C bonds, 
which takes a huge amount of thermal energy. It is hard because 
the three-dimensional lattice resists any deformation that would 
weaken the Si¬ C bonding network. 12.120 The distance between 
planes in crystalline silicon is 3.13 Å. 12.126 (a) 109° (b) 120°
