orm images at
the rate of about 30 per second. This can be compared to motion picture or tele-
vision cameras, which operate by taking a series of still pictures at a rate of 24
(movies) and 60 or 30 (U.S. television) per second. Their rapid projection on the
screen gives the appearance of motion.
The lens of the eye (
to 1.406) does little of the bending of the light
rays. Most of the refraction is done at the front surface of the cornea
at its interface with air
The lens acts as a fine adjustment for focusing
at different distances. This is accomplished by the ciliary muscles (Fig. 25–9),
which change the curvature of the lens so that its focal length is changed. To
focus on a distant object, the ciliary muscles of the eye are relaxed and the lens is
thin, as shown in Fig. 25–10a, and parallel rays focus at the focal point (on the
retina). To focus on a nearby object, the muscles contract, causing the center of
the lens to thicken, Fig. 25–10b, thus shortening the focal length so tha
