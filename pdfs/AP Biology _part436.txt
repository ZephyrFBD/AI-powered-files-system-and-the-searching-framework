orm, unbanded snails have the selective
advantage. Each morph is better adapted in a different area, but both
varieties continue to exist.
2. Geographic Variation
Two different varieties of rabbit continue to exist in two different regions
in North America. Rabbits in the cold, snowy northern regions are
camouflaged with white fur and have short ears to conserve body heat.
Rabbits living in warmer, southern regions have mottled fur to blend in
with surrounding woodsy areas and long ears to radiate off excess body
heat. Such a graded variation in the phenotype of an organism is known as
a cline. Because the variation in rabbit appearance is due to differences in
northern and southern environments, this is an example of a north-south
cline.
3. Sexual Reproduction
Sexual reproduction provides variation due to the shuffling and
recombination of alleles during meiosis and fertilization.
Independent assortment of chromosomes during metaphase I
results in the recombination of unlinked genes.
