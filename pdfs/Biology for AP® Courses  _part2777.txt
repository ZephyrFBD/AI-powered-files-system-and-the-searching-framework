shape of the curve obtained when increasing humidity is
plotted against constant temperature to find the rate of
transcription?
a.
Increasing humidity leads to reduced
evaporation rates due to increased difference in
water vapor pressure between leaf and
atmosphere.
b.
Increasing humidity leads to reduced
evaporation rates due to decreased difference in
water vapor pressure between leaf and soil.
c.
Increasing humidity leads to reduced
evaporation rates due to decreased difference in
water vapor pressure between leaf and
atmosphere.
d.
Increasing humidity leads to increased
evaporation rates due to decreased difference in
water vapor pressure between leaf and
atmosphere.
