(A) is synthesized on soluble ribosomes and packaged into lysosomes, from which it is secreted into the oviduct 
(B) is synthesized on ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and then secreted directly into the 
oviduct 
(C) crosses the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as it is translated, then moves to the Golgi apparatus, then to 
vesicles from which it is secreted 
(D) crosses the Golgi apparatus membrane post-translationally, is taken up by the Golgi apparatus and  
endoplasmic reticulum, then is packaged into secretory vesicles

 Freshwater bony fish secrete large volumes of 
very dilute urine. Many marine bony fish secrete 
small volumes of concentrated urine. Which of 
the following best explains the differences in 
nitrogenous-waste excretion between freshwater 
and marine bony fish? 
(A) The differences arose duri
