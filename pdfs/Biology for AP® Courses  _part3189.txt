 dedicated system, and electrical activity in
the axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus—a sound.
The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an
intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate
of production of action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An
intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might
stimulate fewer receptors. Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and
the brain will further process incoming signals.
Perception
Perception is an individual’s interpretation of a sensation. Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors,
