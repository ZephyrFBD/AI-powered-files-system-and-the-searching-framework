e fusion of these two haploid
cells to form a single, unique diploid cell with a complete set of genetic information. In most plants and animals, through
multiple rounds of mitotic cell division, this diploid cell will develop into an adult organism. Haploid cells that are necessary
for sexual reproduction are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis. Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and
fertilization, introduces variation into offspring. Variation is an important component of a species evolutionary success. The
vast majority of eukaryotic organisms employs some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.
Not all sexually reproducing eukaryotes reproduce solely by sexual reproduction. For example, an Asian termite species,
Reticulitermes speratus, can reproduce sexually or asexually. In a young colony, a single termite pair—the king and
queen—produce worker offspring sexually by the union of haploid cells. However, after several years, as the queen begins
to age,
