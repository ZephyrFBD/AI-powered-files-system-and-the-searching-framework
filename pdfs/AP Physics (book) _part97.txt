When changing units, you can avoid making an error in the use of conver-
sion factors by checking that units cancel out properly. For example, in our
conversion of 1 mi to 1609 m in Example 1–5(a), if we had incorrectly used the
factor 
instead of 
the centimeter units would not have cancelled
out; we would not have ended up with meters.
