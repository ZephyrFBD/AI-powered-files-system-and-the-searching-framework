ifferent ways, and
every phylogenetic tree is a hypothesis. Scientists narrow down the
possibilities by using the principle of maximum parsimony, which states
that one should follow the simplest explanation that coincides with the
facts.

Phylogenetic trees and cladograms are constantly being revised based on biological
data and emerging knowledge.
Table 10.4 shows shared and derived traits for building a phylogenetic
tree. A “ – ” indicates that a trait is absent; a “ + ” indicates that a trait is
present.

Table 10.4
Figure 10.4 shows a phylogenetic tree for the animals listed in Table 10.4.
It includes ingroups, the organisms of interest—lamprey, bass, frog, turtle,
and leopard—and as a point of reference, the outgroup, lancelet. The
outgroup is the group that diverged before the lineage evolved, in this case,
vertebrates. When two lineages diverge, the split is depicted as a node. In
this example, the nodes are development of a verte
