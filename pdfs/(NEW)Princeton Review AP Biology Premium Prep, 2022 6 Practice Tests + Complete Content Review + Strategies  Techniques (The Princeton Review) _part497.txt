with the addition of Protein Y, but it has increased transcription, protein, and
enzyme activity with the addition of Protein X. It is likely that Protein X is an enhancer of transcription of gene A.
Perhaps it binds directly to the promoter region of gene A and assists RNA polymerase to bind. It might also remove a
repressor of transcription or work together with other transcription factors. The increase in mRNA would lead to
increased protein and increased enzyme activity down the road.
Gene B has a decrease in mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity with Protein X. It has increased total activity with
Protein Y. It is likely that Protein X is a repressor of transcription for gene B. It might bind to the promoter of gene B or
to another transcription factor to prevent RNA polymerase binding or prevent transcription from occurring in another
way. Since the enzyme activity increases with Protein Y, but the mRNA and the protein levels did not change, this
means that the enzyme activity was s
