nditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three
domains—Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya—evolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes. His laboratory
proposes that this structure is the best fit for data from extensive DNA analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the
ring model is the only one that adequately takes HGT and genomic fusion into account. However, other phylogeneticists
remain highly skeptical of this model.
Figure 20.18 According to the “ring of life” phylogenetic model, the three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive
prokaryotes.
In summary, the “tree of life” model proposed by Darwin must be modified to include HGT. Does this mean abandoning the
tree model completely? Even Lake argues that all attempts should be made to discover some modification of the tree model
to allow it to accurately fit his data, and only the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal.
