rcle, it turns around and repeats the pattern in the opposite direction. In
the round dance, bees obtain food-location information by tasting or smelling flower or nectar scents on the dancing
bee. As the distance to the food increases, the round dance develops into the waggle dance, a dance with a figure-
eight pattern. The intersection of the two circles of the figure eight is called a straight run. When the bees dance
along the straight run, they provide distance and directional information to the food. The longer the straight run, the
greater the distance to the food. The larger the angle between the straight run (on a vertical honeycomb surface) and
an imaginary vertical line, the greater the angle of the food source with respect to the position of the sun. While
dancing along the straight run, the dancing bee vibrates its wings (buzzes) and wags its abdomen. To determine the
length and angle of the straight run, the observing bees make body contact (tactile communication) with th
