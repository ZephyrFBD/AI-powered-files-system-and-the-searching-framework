Free energy (G) is defined as ΔG = ΔH – TΔS where H is enthalpy, T is
temperature in Kelvin, and S is entropy. The ΔG during a reaction indicates
whether or not the reaction occurs spontaneously.
Living organisms use free energy to grow, maintain organization, and reproduce.
Examples of reactions that occur in cells include breaking down glucose,
converting pyruvate to lactate, and/or synthesizing ATP:  
glucose + O2 → CO2 + H2O
ΔG = –2880 kJ/mol of glucose
glucose → lactate + H+
ΔG = –195.8 kJ/mol
pyruvate + NADH + H+ → lactate + NAD+
ΔG = –25.1 kJ/mol
ADP + Pi → ATP + H2O
ΔG =  57 kJ/mol
44. Which of the following statements best describes how cells use energy
from the breakdown of glucose via cellular respiration to increase
organization in the system?
Cells can couple the endergonic reaction with a process that
increases entropy.
