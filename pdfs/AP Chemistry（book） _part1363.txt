nce-
bond theory, the bonding electrons are 
visualized as originating in atomic orbitals on 
two atoms. A covalent bond is formed when 
these orbitals overlap.
 
9.5 ▶ Hybrid Orbitals Examine how the orbitals 
of one atom mix with one another, or hybridize, 
to create hybrid orbitals.
 
9.6 ▶ Multiple Bonds Learn how atomic orbitals 
overlap in multiple ways to produce sigma and 
pi bonds between atoms. Single bonds consist 
of one sigma bond; multiple bonds involve one 
sigma and one or more pi bonds. Examine the 
geometric arrangements of these bonds and how 
they are exemplified in organic compounds.
 
9.7  ▶ Molecular Orbitals Examine a more 
sophisticated treatment of bonding called 
molecular orbital theory, which introduces the 
concepts of bonding and antibonding molecular 
orbitals.
 
9.8  ▶ Bonding in period 2 Diatomic 
Molecules  Extend the concepts of molecular 
orbital theory to construct energy-level diagrams 
for second-row diatomic molecules.
