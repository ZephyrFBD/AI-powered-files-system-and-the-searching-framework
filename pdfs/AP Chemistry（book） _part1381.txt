 are of equal length. In both resonance structures, the central O atom is 
bonded to the two outer O atoms and has one nonbonding pair. Thus, there 
are three electron domains about the central O atoms. (Remember that a 
double bond counts as a single electron domain.) The arrangement of three 
electron domains is trigonal planar (Table 9.1). Two of the domains are from 
bonds, and one is due to a nonbonding pair. So, the molecular geometry is 
bent with an ideal bond angle of 120° (Table 9.2).
