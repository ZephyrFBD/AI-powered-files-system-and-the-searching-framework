Overview
Mutations generate genetic variation in a population. These genetic variations lead to different phenotypes in a
population. Different types of selection act upon these variations in phenotypes, leading to differential reproductive
success. Populations evolve when some members of the population have greater reproductive success than other
members of the population. This chapter will review the evidence of evolution and the different types of selection
that may affect a population.
Evidence of Evolution
Evidence of evolution can be found in both extant (living) and extinct species. Some categories of evidence of
evolution include:
Molecular evidence—Comparing DNA sequences and amino acid sequences in pr
