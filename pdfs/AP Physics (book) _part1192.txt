Echolocation. Echolocation is a form of sensory percep-
tion used by animals such as bats, dolphins, and toothed whales (Fig. 11–28). The
animal emits a pulse of sound (a longitudinal wave) which, after reflection from
objects, returns and is detected by the animal. Echolocation waves can have
frequencies of about 100,000 Hz. (a) Estimate the wavelength of a sea animal’s
echolocation wave. (b) If an obstacle is 100 m from the animal, how long after
the animal emits a wave is its reflection detected?
APPROACH We first compute the speed of longitudinal (sound) waves in sea
water, using Eq. 11–14b and Tables 9–1 and 10–1. The wavelength is
