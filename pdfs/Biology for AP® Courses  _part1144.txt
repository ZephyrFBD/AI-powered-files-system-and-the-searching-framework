10.3 | Control of the Cell Cycle
In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
What are examples of internal and external mechanisms that control the cell cycle?
•
What molecules are involved in controlling the cell cycle through positive and negative regulation?
Connection for AP® Courses
Each step of the cell cycle is closely monitored by external signals and internal controls called checkpoints. There are three
major checkpoints in the cell cycle: one near the end of G1, a second at the G2/M transition, and the third during metaphase.
Growth factor proteins arriving at the dividing cell’s plasma membrane can trigger the cell to begin dividing. Cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are internal
