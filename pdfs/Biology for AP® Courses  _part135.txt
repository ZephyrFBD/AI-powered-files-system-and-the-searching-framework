l biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry. Therefore, in order to understand how biological systems
work, it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry. For example, the flow of blood within the
circulatory system follows the laws of physics regulating the modes of fluid flow. Chemical laws dictate the breakdown of
large, complex food molecules into smaller molecules as well as their conversion to energy stored in adenosine triphosphate
(ATP). Polar molecules, the formation of hydrogen bonds, and the resulting properties of water are key to understanding
living processes. Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important to understand various biological processes such
as digestion. Therefore, the fundamentals of physics and chemistry are the foundation for gaining insight into biological
processes.
An example of how understanding of chemical processes can give insight to a biological process is recent research on
