inated
by matter which interacts by gravity, and the fate of the universe was connected
to the curvature of space-time (Section 33–4). If the universe had negative curvature,
the expansion of the universe would never stop, although the rate of expansion
would decrease due to the gravitational attraction of its parts. Such a universe
would be open and infinite. If the universe is flat (no curvature), it would still be
open and infinite but its expansion would slowly approach a zero rate. If 
the universe had positive curvature, it would be closed and finite; the effect of
gravity would be strong enough that the expansion would eventually stop and the
universe would begin to contract, collapsing back onto itself in a big crunch.
Critical Density
According to the above scenario (which does not include inflation or the recently
discovered acceleration of the universe), the fate of the universe would depend
on the average mass–energy density in the universe. For an average mass density
