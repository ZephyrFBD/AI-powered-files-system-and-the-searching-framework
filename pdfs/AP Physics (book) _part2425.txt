81. A pair of power transmission lines each have a
resistance and carry 740 A over 9.0 km. If the rms input
voltage is 42 kV, calculate (a) the voltage at the other end,
(b) the power input, (c) power loss in the lines, and (d) the
power output.
82. Two resistanceless rails rest 32 cm apart on a 6.0Â° ramp.
They are joined at the bottom by a
resistor. At the
top a copper bar of mass 0.040 kg (ignore its resistance) is
laid across the rails. Assuming a vertical 0.45-T magnetic
field, what is the terminal (steady) velocity of the bar as it
slides frictionlessly down the rails?
83. Show that the power loss in transmission lines,
is given
by 
where 
is the power transmitted to
the user, V is the delivered voltage, and 
is the resistance
of the power lines.
