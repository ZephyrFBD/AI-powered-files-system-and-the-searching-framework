ion
of DNA and if it fails, the cells may undergo
nondisjunction of chromosomes.
d.
The M checkpoint ensures that all the
components required for cell division are
available and if it fails, the cell cycle will be
inhibited.
30. List the regulatory mechanisms that might be lost in a
cell producing faulty p53.
a.
assessment of damaged DNA, recruiting repair
enzymes, and binding of spindle to kinetochore
b.
quality of DNA, triggering apoptosis, and
recruiting repair enzymes
c.
quality of DNA, binding of spindle to
kinetochore, and assessment of DNA repair
d.
triggering apoptosis, recruiting repair enzymes,
and proper binding of spindle to kinetochore
31. p53 can trigger apoptosis if certain cell cycle events
fail. How does this regulatory outcome benefit a
multicellular organism?
a.
The apoptosis helps in controlling the
consumption of energy by the extra cells.
b.
The apoptosis inhibits the production of faulty
proteins, which could be produced due to the
DNA damage.
c.
The process of a
