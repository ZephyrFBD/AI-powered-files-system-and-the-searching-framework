e dis-
tribution between two bonded atoms with unequal electronegativi-
ties. A molecular dipole moment is the three-dimensional sum of all 
the bond dipoles in a molecule. 9.37 (a) Yes. The net dipole moment 
vector points along the Cl¬ S ¬Cl angle bisector. (b) No, BeCl2 does 
not have a dipole moment. 9.39 (a) Nonpolar. The polar B ¬ F bonds 
are arranged in a symmetrical trigonal planar geometry. (b) No. The 
added nonbonding electron pair requires that the electron domain 
geometry is tetrahedral and the shape is a trigonal pyramid. (c) Yes. In 
BF2Cl, the bond dipoles do not cancel. 9.41 (a) IF (d) PCl3 and (f) IF5 
are polar. 9.43  (a) Lewis structures
