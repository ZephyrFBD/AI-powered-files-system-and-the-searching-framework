lected, then the justification
is that the effect of amanitin on the maximum elongation rate cannot be
determined without comparison to the maximum elongation rate under the
same conditions without amanitin.

(C)
Describe the effect of amanitin on the maximum elongation rate for the  
wild-type and modified RNA polymerases.
•	Amanitin decreases the maximum elongation rate for the wild strain and does 
not affect the rate in the experimental strain.

Determine the ratio of the average maximum elongation rate for the modified 
RNA polymerase compared to the wild strain RNA polymerase in Figure 1.
Accept one of the following (or appropriate multiples of these ratios):
•	1 : 6
•	1 / 6
•	1 to 6
