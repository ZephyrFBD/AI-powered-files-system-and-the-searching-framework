moregulate) on thermoregulation to see
illustrations of this process in a variety of animals.
How does the loose skin of an elephant help it regulate body temperature?
a.
Loose skin is thicker, which allows the excess heat to dissipate quickly through the skin.
b.
Loose skin brings more heat and blood to the body surface, facilitating heat loss.
c.
Loose skin contains greater skin area, which allows excess heat to dissipate as heat loss occurs through the
skin.
d.
Loose skin has smaller skin area, which allows excess heat to dissipate as heat loss occurs through the skin.
Endotherms and Ectotherms
Animals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental
temperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the
environment. Animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms. This group has been called cold-blooded,
but the term may not apply to an animal
