 motion and then its dynamics (involving torque), as well 
as rotational kinetic energy and angular momentum (the rotational analog of 
linear momentum). Our understanding of the world around us will be increased
significantly—from rotating bicycle wheels and compact discs to amusement park 
rides, a spinning skater, the rotating Earth, and a centrifuge—and there may be a
few surprises.
We will consider mainly the rotation of rigid objects about a fixed axis.
A rigid object is an object with a definite shape that doesn’t change, so that the
particles composing it stay in fixed positions relative to one another. Any real
object is capable of vibrating or deforming when a force is exerted on it. But these
effects are often very small, so the concept of an ideal rigid object is very useful as
a good approximation.
