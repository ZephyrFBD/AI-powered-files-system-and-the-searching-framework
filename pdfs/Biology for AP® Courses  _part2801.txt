As you have learned, specialized cells in the animal body are organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems, which
efficiently localize functions, such as the digestion of food and the elimination of wastes. As we explore the information in
this section, our primary focus is homeostasis—the ability to maintain dynamic equilibrium around a set point. Animals
need to maintain their “normal” internal environments while also responding to external environmental changes.
In our study of biology thus far, we have seen numerous examples of structure-function relationships, and the design of the
animal body is no exception. Specialization in multicellular animals contributes to efficiency in cell processes. For example,
animals must be able to procure nutrients and eliminate wastes, a
