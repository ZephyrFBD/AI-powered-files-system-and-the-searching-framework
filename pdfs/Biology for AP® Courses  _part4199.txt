 organisms living at very high
elevations, however, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air. In aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved
oxygen is related to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. Cold water has more dissolved oxygen than
warmer water. In addition, salinity, current, and tide can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems.
Other Terrestrial Factors
Wind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation and transpiration. The physical force
of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic factors, as well as an ecosystem’s organisms.
Fire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. Some organisms are
adapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. For example, the
jack pine—a coniferous tree—requires heat from fire for its seed cones to open (Figur
