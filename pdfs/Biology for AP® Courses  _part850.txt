ving cells. But living things consume more
than glucose for food. How does a turkey sandwich end up as ATP in your cells? This happens because all of the catabolic
pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways (see
Figure 7.18). Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porousâ€”that is, substances enter from other pathways, and
intermediates leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems. Many of the substrates, intermediates, and
products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.
Connections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism
Glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is an energy storage molecule in animals. When there is adequate ATP present, excess
glucose is shunted into glycogen for storage. Glycogen is made and stored in both liver and muscle. The glycogen will be
hydrolyzed into glucose 1-phosphate monomers (G-1-P) if blood sugar levels drop. The presence of glycogen as a source
of
