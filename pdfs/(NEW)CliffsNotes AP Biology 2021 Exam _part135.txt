er why the energy
in an energy-rich molecule like NADH is removed and put into the formation of ethanol, essentially a waste product
that eventually kills the yeast (and other organisms) that produce it. The goal of this pathway, however, does not
really concern ethanol, but the
task of freeing NAD+to allow glycolysis to continue. Recall that in the
 
absence of O2, all the NAD+is bottled up in NADH. This is because
 
oxidative phosphorylation cannot accept the electrons of NADH without oxygen. The purpose of the fermentation
pathway, then, is to release some
 
NAD+for use by glycolysis. The reward for this effort is 2 ATP from
 
glycolysis for each 2 converted pyruvate. This is not much, but it’s better than the alternative—0 ATP and imminent
cellular death.
Lactic Acid Fermentation
Only one step occurs in lactic acid fermentation (Figure 4-3). A pyruvate is converted to lactate (or lactic acid); in
the process, NADH gives up its
 
electrons to form NAD+. As in alcohol fermentation, t
