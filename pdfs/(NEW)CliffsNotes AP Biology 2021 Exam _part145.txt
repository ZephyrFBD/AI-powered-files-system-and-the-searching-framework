removes electrons from NADH to make NAD+. No ATP is generated by
 
this step.
12. D. Protons, not electrons, pass through ATP synthase as they move down the proton gradient. An electrical
gradient or voltage is produced by the greater number of positive charges (from the protons) in the intermembrane
space relative to the number of positive charges inside the crista membrane.
13. D. During strenuous exercise, glucose is broken down to pyruvate.
 
Aerobic respiration produces CO2. Anaerobic respiration, which would
 
occur during strenuous exercise, would increase lactate formation. Exercise would also consume ATP, producing
ADP and Pi. 14. C. The purpose of O2 is to accept the electrons at the end of the electron transport chain in
oxidative phosphorylation. The electrons
 
combine with O2 and H+ to form water. Products from the breakdown
 
of lipids and proteins are converted to pyruvate, acetyl CoA, or intermediate carbon compounds used in the Krebs
cycle.
 
15. C. Oxidative phosphor
