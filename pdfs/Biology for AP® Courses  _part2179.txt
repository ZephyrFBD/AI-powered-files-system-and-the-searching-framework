o the more beneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype. Think back to the mice that live at
the beach. Some are light-colored and blend in with the sand, while others are dark and blend in with the patches of grass.
The dark-colored mice may be, overall, more fit than the light-colored mice, and at first glance, one might expect the light-
colored mice be selected for a darker coloration. But remember that the intermediate phenotype, a medium-colored coat, is
very bad for the miceâ€”they cannot blend in with either the sand or the grass and are more likely to be eaten by predators.
As a result, the light-colored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals that began moving
in that direction (began being selected for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light.
