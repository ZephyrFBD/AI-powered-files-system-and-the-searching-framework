 the pint. I’m about to give the money to the 
 
 woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there’s Aunt 
 
 Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother’s 
 
 funeral? Gorgin’ yourself on sweets.And where’s that father of yours? 
 
 He’s, he’s, in the pub. 
 
 Of course he’s in the pub.You out here stuffin’ yourself with sweets 
 
 and him in there gettin’ himself into a staggerin’ condition the day your 
 
 poor little brother goes to the graveyard. She tells the shop woman, Just 
 
 like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul’ northern jaw. 
 
 She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking 
 
 and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the 
 
  
  
 pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country. 
 
 Dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face 
 
 and hair growing out of his nose.They’re not talking but staring straight 
 
 ahead and their black pint
