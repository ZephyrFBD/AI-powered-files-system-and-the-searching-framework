refractive index gives this glass a particularly sparkling appearance. Addition of non-
metal oxides, such as B2O3 and P4O10, which form network structures related to the sili-
cates, also changes the properties of the glass. Adding B2O3 creates a “borosilicate” glass 
with a higher melting point and a greater ability to withstand temperature changes. Such 
glasses, sold commercially under trade names such as Pyrex® and Kimax®, are used where 
resistance to thermal shock is important, such as in laboratory glassware or coffeemakers.

Silicones
Silicones consist of O ¬Si¬O chains in which the two remaining bonding positions on 
each silicon are occupied by organic groups such as CH3:

Depending on chain length and degree of cross-linking, silicones can be either oils 
or rubber-like materials. Silicones are nontoxic and hav
