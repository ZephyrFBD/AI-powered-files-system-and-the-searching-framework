des
requires that the two strands are arranged in opposite directions, or antiparallel.
4. Both temperature and the presence of an enzyme increase the rate of a reaction. Because molecules are moving
faster at higher temperatures, there are more collisions and therefore more reactions. As a catalyst, an enzyme speeds
up reactions by facilitating the coming together of the reactants (thus lowering activation energy). At 45°C, the
influence of the enzyme is eliminated because the high temperature denaturizes it and the reaction rate falls back to
the rate that occurs in the absence of an enzyme.
Some Typical Answers to Long Question
Question 1
a. Enzymes are globular proteins. Proteins, in turn, are polymers of amino acids—chains of amino acids, bonded to
each other by peptide bonds. The general formula for an amino acid is a central carbon
atom bonded to an amino group (−NH2), a carboxyl group (−COOH),
and a hydrogen atom. A fourth bond is made with a group of atoms that varies with eac
