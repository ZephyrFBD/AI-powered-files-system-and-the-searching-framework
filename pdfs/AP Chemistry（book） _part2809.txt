17.6  Match the following descriptions of titration curves 
with the diagrams: (a) strong acid added to strong base, 
 
(b) strong base added to weak acid, (c) strong base added to 
strong acid, (d) strong base added to polyprotic acid. [Sec-

17.7  Equal volumes of two acids are titrated with 0.10 M NaOH 
resulting in the two titration curves shown in the follow-
ing figure. (a) Which curve corresponds to the more con-
centrated acid solution? (b) Which corresponds to the acid 
with the larger Ka? [Section 17.3]
