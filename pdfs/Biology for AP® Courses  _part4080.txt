Reproductive Endocrinologist
A reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to
reproduction and infertility in both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems, infertility,
pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and menopause. Doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted
reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves the use of procedures to manipulate the egg
or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization.
Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics
and gynecology, then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board certified in this
area, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas.
