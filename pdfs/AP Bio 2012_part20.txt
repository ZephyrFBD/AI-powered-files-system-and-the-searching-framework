No credit will
be given for anything written in this exam booklet, but you may use the booklet for notes
or scratch work. When answering the multiple-choice items, write on the answer sheet the
letter corresponding to the answer you think is best. Give only one answer to each
question. For the grid-in items, write in the appropriate number, using decimals and other
symbols as appropriate. Units are not required for grid-in items.
Use your time effectively, working as quickly as you can without losing accuracy. Do not
spend too much time on any one question. Go on to other questions and come back to
the ones you have not answered if you have time. It is not expected that everyone will
know the answers to all of the questions.
Your total score on Section I is based only on the number of questions answered correctly.
Points are not deducted for incorrect answers or unanswered questions.
DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET UNTIL YOU ARE TOLD TO DO SO.
