Phosphorus exists in several allotropic forms. White phosphorus con-
sists of P4 tetrahedra (Figure 22.25). The bond angles in this molecule, 60°, are 
unusually small, so there is much strain in the bonding, which is consistent 
with the high reactivity of white phosphorus. This allotrope bursts sponta-
neously into flames if exposed to air. When heated in the absence of air to 
about 400 °C, white phosphorus is converted to a more stable allotrope known 
as red phosphorus, which does not ignite on contact with air. Red phosphorus 
is also considerably less poisonous than the white form. We will denote ele-
mental phosphorus as simply P(s).
Phosphorus Halides
Phosphorus forms a wide range of compounds with the halogens, the most 
important of which are the trihalides and pentahalides. Phosphorus trichlo-
ride 1PCl32 is commercially the most significant of these compounds and is 
used to prepare a wide variety of products, includin
