 charge of the SO4
2- ion. Thus, we have 
x + 41-22 = -2. From this relation we conclude that the oxi-
dation number of S in this ion is +6.
Comment These examples illustrate that the oxidation number of 
a given element depends on the compound in which it occurs. 
The oxidation numbers of sulfur, as seen in these examples, range 
from -2 to +6.
Give It Some Thought
What is the oxidation number of nitrogen (a) in aluminum nitride, AlN, and  
(b) in nitric acid, HNO3?

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Oxidation of Metals by Acids and Salts
The reaction between a metal and either an acid or a metal salt conforms to the general pattern
 
A + BX ยก AX + B 
[4.23]
Examples: 
Zn1s2 + 2 HBr1aq2 ยก ZnBr21aq2 + H21g2 
 
Mn1s2 + Pb1NO3221aq2 ยก Mn(NO3221aq2 + Pb1s2
These reactions are called displacement reactions because the ion in solution is dis-
placed (replaced) through oxidation of an element.
Many metals undergo displacement reactions with acids, producing salts and hydro-
gen gas
