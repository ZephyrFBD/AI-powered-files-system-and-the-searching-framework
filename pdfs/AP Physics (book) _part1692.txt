12. (III) The PV diagram in Fig.15–23 shows two possible states
of a system containing 1.75 moles of a monatomic ideal
gas.
(a) Draw the process which depicts an isobaric expansion from
state 1 to state 2, and label this process A. (b) Find the work
done by the gas and the change in internal energy of the gas in
process A. (c) Draw the two-step process which depicts an
isothermal expansion from state 1 to the volume 
followed
by an isovolumetric increase in temperature to state 2, and
label this process B.
(d) Find the change
in internal energy
of the gas for the
two-step process B.

13. (III) When a gas is taken from a to c along the curved path
in Fig. 15–24, the work done by the gas is 
and
the heat added to the gas is
