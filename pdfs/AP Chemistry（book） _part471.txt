Calculating the Amount of Product Formed from a Limiting Reactant
The most important commercial process for converting N2 from the air into nitrogen-containing compounds is based on the 
reaction of N2 and H2 to form ammonia 1NH32:
N21g2 + 3 H21g2 ¡ 2 NH31g2
How many moles of NH3 can be formed from 3.0 mol of N2 and 6.0 mol of H2?
The reaction
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 H2O1g2
is used to produce electricity in a hydrogen fuel cell. Suppose a fuel cell contains 150 g of H21g2 and 1500 g of O21g2 (each 
measured to two significant figures). How many grams of water can form?
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
When 24 mol of methanol and 15 mol of oxygen combine 
in the combustion reaction 2 CH3OH1l2 + 3 O21g2 ¡
2 CO21g2 + 4 H2O1g2, what is the excess reactant and how  
many moles of it remains at the end of the reaction?  
(a) 9 mol CH3OH1l2 (b) 10 mol CO21g2 (c) 10 mol CH3OH1l2  
(d) 14 mol CH3OH1l2 (e) 1 mol O21g2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
(a) When 1.50 mol of Al and 3.00 mol of Cl2 combine in th
