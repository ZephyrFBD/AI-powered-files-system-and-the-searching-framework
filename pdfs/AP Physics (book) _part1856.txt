NOTE We could not use Eqs. 17–4 here because they apply only to uniform
fields. But we did use Eq. 17–3 because it is always valid.

EXERCISE C What work is required to bring a charge
originally a distance
of 1.50 m from a charge
until it is 0.50 m away?
Q = 20.0 mC

To determine the electric field at points near a collection of two or more
point charges requires adding up the electric fields due to each charge. Since the
electric field is a vector, this can be time consuming or complicated. To find the
electric potential at a point due to a collection o
