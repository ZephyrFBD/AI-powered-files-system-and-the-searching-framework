e first activated protein kinase is able to activate multiple copies of the second protein
kinase. Then, each copy of the second protein kinase is able to activate multiple copies of the third. Because each
protein kinase functions repeatedly until it is dephosphorylated, each step of the cascade magnifies the response.
6. D. The purpose of a signaling cascade (or any signal transduction pathway) is to elicit a cellular response. In
general, these cellular responses include the activation of cytoplasmic enzymatic activity, the activation of a second
messenger, or the activation or inhibition of transcription factors that regulate transcription. The product of the
signaling cascade shown in the figure is an activated protein that enters the nucleus. Since the figure designates a
mitogen-activated protein signaling cascade, the cellular response is to stimulate cell division. Cell division can be
initiated by activating transcription factors that regulate transcription of DNA. The produc
