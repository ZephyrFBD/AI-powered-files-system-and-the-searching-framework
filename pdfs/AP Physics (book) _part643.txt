l friction and air resistance. These forces depend on the conditions and
speed of the car, but are typically in the range 400 N to 1000 N.
It is often convenient to write power in terms of the net force F applied to an
object and its speed v. This is readily done because

Calculation of power needed for a
car to climb a hill.
Power needs of a car. Calculate the power required of a
1400-kg car under the following circumstances: (a) the car climbs a 10° hill 
(a fairly steep hill) at a steady 
and (b) the car accelerates along a level
road from 90 to 
in 6.0 s to pass another car. Assume the average
retarding force on the car is  
throughout. See Fig. 6–29.
APPROACH First we must be careful not to confuse 
which is due to air
resistance and friction
