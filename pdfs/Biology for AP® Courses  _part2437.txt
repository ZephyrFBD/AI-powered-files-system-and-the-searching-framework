The Ancient Atmosphere
Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth’s existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there
was no molecular oxygen. Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen—anaerobic organisms—were
able to live. Autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs, and they
appeared within one billion years of the formation of Earth. Then, cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae,
evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later. Cyanobacteria (Figure 22.4) began the oxygenation of the
atmosphere. Increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the development of more efficient O2-utilizing catabolic pathways. It
also opened up the land to increased colonization, because some O2 is converted into O3 (ozone) and ozone effectively
absorbs the ultraviolet l
