experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical
industries, and college and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist
should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience
working in a laboratory.

1) Using a molecular modeling kit (or an online virtual kit such as jmol), create a model of each of the 4
nucleotides in DNA, based on structural diagrams found in this chapter or elsewhere online.
2) Identify where each nucleotide hydrogen-bonds with its complementary base. Add these bonds to secure
the two pairs of nucleotides together. How does the hydrogen bonding differ between the two pairs of
complementary bases?
3) Now look at a structural diagram of a complete DNA molecule. Based on the diagram, connect your two
pairs of nucleot
