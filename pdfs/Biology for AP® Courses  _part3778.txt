ies use and recycle what
they can and excrete the remaining waste products. Our bodiesâ€™ complex systems have developed ways to treat waste
and maintain a balanced internal environment. (credit: modification of work by Redwin Law)

Introduction
The daily intake recommendation for human water consumption is eight to ten glasses of water. In order to achieve a
healthy balance, the human body should excrete the eight to ten glasses of water every day. This occurs via the processes
of urination, defecation, sweating and, to a small extent, respiration. The organs and tissues of the human body are soaked
in fluids that are maintained at constant temperature, pH, and solute concentration, all crucial elements of homeostasis. The
solutes in body fluids are mainly mineral salts and sugars, and osmo
