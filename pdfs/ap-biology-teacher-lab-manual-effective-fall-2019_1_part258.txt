Table 2. Percentage Similarity Between the GAPDH Gene and Protein in Humans and  
Other Species 
Species 
Gene Percentage 
Similarity 
Protein Percentage 
Similarity 
Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) 
99.6% 
100% 
Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) 
91.3% 
95.2% 
Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) 
72.4% 
76.7% 
Roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans) 
68.2% 
74.3% 
a. Why is the percentage similarity in the gene always lower than the percentage 
similarity in the protein for each of the species? (Hint: Recall how a gene is 
expressed to produce a protein.) 
b. Draw a cladogram depicting the evolutionary relationships among all five species 
(including humans) according to their percentage similarity in the GAPDH gene.
