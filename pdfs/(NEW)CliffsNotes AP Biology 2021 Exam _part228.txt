mit growth or
influence the start of a new cell division, as follows:
1. Surface-to-volume ratio (S/V). When a cell grows, the volume of a
cell increases faster than the surface area of the plasma membrane enclosing it. This is because volume increases by
the cube of the radius
(volume of a sphere
 
, where r is the radius), whereas the surface
area increases by only the square of the radius (surface area = 4Ï€ r2). When S/V is large, the surface area is large
relative to the volume. Under these conditions, the cell can efficiently react with the outside environment. For
example, adequate amounts of oxygen (for respiration) can diffuse into the cell, and waste products can be rapidly
eliminated. When S/V is small, the surface area is small compared to the volume. When this occurs, the surface area
might be unable to exchange enough substances with the outside environment to service the large volume of the cell.
At this point, cell growth stops or cell division begins.
