ication and the process of signal transduction.
Types of Cell Signaling
The survival of a living organism depends on the ability of its cell, or cells, to communicate by sending, receiving,
and responding to chemical signals. These chemical signals are called ligands. Figures 10.1–10.4 show four general
types of cell signaling:
1. Autocrine signaling—In autocrine signaling, the cell secretes a ligand. This ligand then binds to a receptor
on the cell that secreted the ligand, triggering a response within that same cell. The root word auto means
“self,” so this process can be thought of as a cell signaling itself to generate a response. An example of this is
a cancer cell, which releases its own growth hormones (the ligands) that stimulate the cancer cell to grow and
divide.

2. Juxtacrine signaling—This is signaling that depends on direct contact between the cell that is sending the
ligand and the cell that is receiving and responding to it via a surface r
