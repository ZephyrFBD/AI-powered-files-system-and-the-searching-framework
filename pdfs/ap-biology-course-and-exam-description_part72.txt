DNA is structured as an antiparallel double 
helix, with each strand running in opposite 
5’ to 3’ orientation. Adenine nucleotides 
pair with thymine nucleotides via two 
hydrogen bonds. Cytosine nucleotides 
pair with guanine nucleotides by three 
hydrogen bonds. 
BulletProteins comprise linear chains of amino 
acids, connected by the formation of 
covalent bonds at the carboxyl terminus of 
the growing peptide chain.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
SYI-1.C
Explain how a change in 
the subunits of a polymer 
may lead to changes in 
structure or function of 
the macromolecule.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
SYI-1
Living systems are organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact. 
SUGGESTED SKILL
Argumentation
6.E.b 
Predict the causes or effects 
of a change in, or disruption 
to, one or more components 
in a biological system based 
on a visual representation 
of a biological concept, 
process, or model.
