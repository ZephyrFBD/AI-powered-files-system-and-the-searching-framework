supply of Flint, Michigan. 
Lead is detrimental to many organs in the human body, but the 
brain and central nervous system are particularly sensitive to its pres-
ence. In the brain, Pb2+ ions interfere with cell communication and 
growth by mimicking Ca2+ ions. One of the most serious side effects 
of lead poisoning occurs in young children, where it leads to cognitive 
impairment. Although lead compounds were once used in a variety of 
applications—as a gasoline additive, in pigments, shotgun pellets, glass, 
and water pipes—our daily exposure to lead dropped dramatically once 
governmental agencies started regulating its use in the 1970s. According 
to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the mean 
concentration of lead in the blood for an average U.S. resident dropped 
from 150 ppb in 1976 to 16 ppb by 2002, nearly an order-of-magnitude 
decrease.
