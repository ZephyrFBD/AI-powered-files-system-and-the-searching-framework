ference between a 20-pound bag and a larger bag? In both cases,
at what weights are the differences detected? This smallest detectible difference in stimuli is known as the
just-noticeable difference (JND).
Background: Research background literature on JND and on Weber’s Law, a description of a proposed
mathematical relationship between the overall magnitude of the stimulus and the JND. You will be testing
JND of different weights of rice in bags. Choose a convenient increment that is to be stepped through while
testing. For example, you could choose 10 percent increments between one and two pounds (1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
1.4, and so on) or 20 percent increments (1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8).
Hypothesis: Develop a hypothesis about JND in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested
(such as “the JND between the two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same,”
or “. . . is not proportionally the same.”) So, for the first hypothesis, if the JND between the one-pound
