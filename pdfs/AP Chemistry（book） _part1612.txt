etic energy of the gas 
molecules remains unchanged. This means that the rms speed of the molecules re-
mains unchanged. When the volume is increased, the molecules must move a longer 
distance between collisions. Consequently, there are fewer collisions per unit time 
with the container walls, which means the pressure decreases. Thus, kinetic-molecular 
 
theory explains Boyle’s law.
2. A temperature increase at constant volume causes pressure to in-
crease. 
An increase in temperature means an increase in the average kinetic 
Give It Some Thought
Consider three gases all at 298 K: HCl, H2, and O2. List the gases in order  
of increasing average speed.
10.8 ∣ Molecular Effusion and Diffusion
According to the kinetic-molecular theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of any col-
lection of gas molecules, 1
2 m1urms22, has a specific value at a given temperature. Thus, for 
two gases at the same temperature a gas composed of low-mass particles, such as He, has 
the same average kinet
