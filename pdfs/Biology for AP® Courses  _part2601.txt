y tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types). Dermal
tissue, for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. Vascular tissue
is an example of a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue
transports water and nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel

elements and tracheids (both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma. Phloem tissue, which transports organic
compounds from the site of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which
conduct photosynthates), companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. Unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem
conducting cells are alive at maturity. The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other (Figure 23.3).
