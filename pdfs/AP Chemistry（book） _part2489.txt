lentiful at equilibrium?
 15.72 If Kc = 1 for the equilibrium 2 A1g2 ∆ B1g2, what is 
the relationship between [A] and [B] at equilibrium?
 15.73 A mixture of CH4 and H2O is passed over a nickel catalyst 
at 1000 K. The emerging gas is collected in a 5.00-L flask 
and is found to contain 8.62 g of CO, 2.60 g of H2, 43.0 g 
 
of CH4, and 48.4 g of H2O. Assuming that equilibrium 
has been reached, calculate Kc and Kp for the reaction 
CH41g2 + H2O1g2 ∆ CO1g2 + 3 H21g2.
 15.74 When 2.00 mol of SO2Cl2 is placed in a 2.00-L flask at 303 
K, 56% of the SO2Cl2 decomposes to SO2 and Cl2
 
   :
SO2Cl21g2 ∆ SO21g2 + Cl21g2
 
 (a) Calculate Kc for this reaction at this temperature. 
 
(b) Calculate Kp for this reaction at 303 K. (c) According 
to Le Châtelier’s principle, would the percent of SO2Cl2 
that decomposes increase, decrease or stay the same if the 
mixture were transferred to a 15.00-L vessel? (d) Use the 
equilibrium constant you calculated above to determine 
the percentage of SO2Cl2
