1 Mass Spectrometer
A mass spectrometer is a device to measure masses of atoms. It is used today not
only in physics but also in chemistry, geology, and medicine, often to identify atoms
(and their concentration) in given samples. Ions are produced by heating the sam-
ple, or by using an electric current. As shown in Fig. 20–41, the ions (mass m,
charge q) pass through slit 
and enter a region (before 
) where there are
crossed 
electric and magnetic fields. Ions follow a straight-line path in this
region if the electric force qE (upward on a positive ion) is just balanced by the
magnetic force 
(downward on a positive ion): that is, if
or
Only those ions whose speed is
will pass through undeflected and
emerge through slit 
(This arrangement is called a velocity selector.) In the
semicircular region, after 
there is only a magne
