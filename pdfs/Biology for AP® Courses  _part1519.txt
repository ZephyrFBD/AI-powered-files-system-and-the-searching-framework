s one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. In
the dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA
interspersed.
Meselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew E. coli for several generations in a
medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into
the DNA (Figure 14.13).

Figure 14.13 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown
in 15N (red band) is heavier than DNA grown in 14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride
solution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA grown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N, after one round of cell
division the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N levels, indicating tha
