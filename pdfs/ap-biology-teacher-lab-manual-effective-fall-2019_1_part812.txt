ll do just that. You will have the chance to 
develop and test your own hypotheses about enzyme activity. To help you get started, 
read the following questions, and write your answers in your laboratory notebook. 
•  In Procedure 1, was the limiting factor of your baseline reaction the enzyme or the 
substrate? How could you modify the procedure you learned to answer this question? 
•  What are three or four factors that vary in the environment in which organisms live? 
Which of those factors do you think could affect enzyme activity? How would you 
modify your basic assay to test your hypothesis? 
Design and conduct an experiment to investigate an answer(s) to one of the questions 
above or another question that might have been raised as you conducted Procedures 1 
and 2. Remember, the primary objective of the investigation is to explore how biotic and 
abiotic factors influence the rate of enzymatic reactions.
