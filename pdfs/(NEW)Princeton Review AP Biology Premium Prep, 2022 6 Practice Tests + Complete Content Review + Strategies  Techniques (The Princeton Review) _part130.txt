H level increases, the rate of reaction will also decrease. Don’t forget to include a
simple explanation of your graph.
Additional quantitative and graphing skills will be discussed at length in a later chapter of this text. There you will
learn how to include statistics and hypothesis testing in your free-response questions and how best to present data
using graphs.
UNDERSTAND CONTROLS IN EXPERIMENTS
Almost every experiment will have at least one group that represents the normal/unchanged/neutral version of the
independent variable. This is called the control. A control is simply a standard of comparison. What does a control
do? It enables the biologist to verify that the outcome of the study is due to changes in the independent variable and
nothing else.
Let’s say the principal of your school thinks that students who eat breakfast do better on the AP Biology exam than
those who don’t eat breakfast. He gives a group of 10 students from your class free breakfast every day for a year.
