4.22 The student is able to construct explanations based on evidence of how variation in
molecular units provides cells with a wider range of functions.
Antibody Structure
An antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: two identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially
bound to each other in a “Y” formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units), as illustrated in
Figure 33.22. Bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other. The
areas where the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant
domains.
In germ-line B cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (V) and five joining (J) segments. An enzyme
called DNA recombinase randomly excises most of
