Calculate ∆H for the reaction
2 C1s2 + H21g2 ¡  C2H21g2
given the following chemical equations and their respective enthalpy changes:
C2H21g2 + 5
2 O21g2 ¡  2 CO21g2 + H2O1l2  ∆H = -1299.6 kJ
C1s2 + O21g2 ¡  CO21g2        ∆H = -393.5 kJ
H21g2 + 1
2 O21g2 ¡  H2O1l2        ∆H = -285.8 kJ
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given a chemical equation and asked to calculate its ∆H 
using three chemical equations and their associated enthalpy changes.
Plan We will use Hess’s law, summing the three equations or their 
reverses and multiplying each by an appropriate coefficient so 
that they add to give the net equation for the reaction of interest. 
At the same time, we keep track of the
