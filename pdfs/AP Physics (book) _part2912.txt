 to a second observer
who moves relative to the first.
It may be tempting to ask: “Which observer is right,
or 
” The answer,
according to relativity, is that they are both right. There is no “best” reference
frame we can choose to determine which observer is right. Both frames are
equally good. We can only conclude that simultaneity is not an absolute concept,
but is relative. We are not aware of this lack of agreement on simultaneity in
everyday life because the effect is noticeable only when the relative speed of the
two reference frames is very large (near c), or the distances involved are very large.
26–4 Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox
The fact that two events simultaneous to one observer may not be simultaneous
to a second observer suggests that time itself is not absolute. Could it be that time
passes differently in one reference frame than in another? This is, indeed, just what
Einstein’s theory of relativity predicts, as the following thought experiment shows.
