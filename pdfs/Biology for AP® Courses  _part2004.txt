uring cell division. As you recall from our
exploration of meiosis, sometimes errors occur in the separation of chromosomes or chromatids, resulting in gametes with
extra chromosomes (polyploidy). This type of speciation is more common in plants than in animals, though some examples
in animals exist. For example, two groups of cichlid fish in Africa’s Lake Victoria, which have distinct morphologies and
diets, may be in the early stage of sympatric speciation without polyploidy, as genetic differences arise between the two
groups.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in this section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea
3 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP® Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide
a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and
AP® exam questions. A learning objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science prac
