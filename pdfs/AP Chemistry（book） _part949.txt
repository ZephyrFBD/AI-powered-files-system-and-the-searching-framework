atom. You will notice that these plots look distinctly different from 
the radial probability functions shown in Figure 6.19.
As shown in Figure 6.21, the collection of points a distance r 
from the nucleus is the surface of a sphere of radius r. The prob-
ability density at each point on that spherical surface is 3c1r242. To 
add up all the individual probability densities requires calculus 
and so is beyond the scope of this text. However, the result of 
that calculation tells us that the radial probability function is the 
probability density, 3c1r242, multiplied by the surface area of the 
sphere, 4pr2:
Radial probability function at distance r = 4pr23c1r242
Thus, the plots of radial probability function in Figure 6.19 are 
equal to the plots of 3c1r242 in Figure 6.22 multiplied by 4pr2. The 
fact that 4pr2 increases rapidly as we move away from the nucleus 
makes the two sets of plots look very different from each other. For 
example, the plot of 3c1r242 for the 3s orbital
