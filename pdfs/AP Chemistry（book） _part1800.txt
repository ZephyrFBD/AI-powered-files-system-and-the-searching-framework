 11.29  Look up and compare the normal boiling points and nor-
mal melting points of H2O and H2S. Based on these physical 
properties, which substance has stronger intermolecular 
forces? What kinds of intermolecular forces exist for each 
molecule?
 11.30  Carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, and chloroform, CHCl3, are 
common organic liquids. Carbon tetrachloride’s normal 
boiling point is 77 °C; chloroform’s normal boiling point 
is 61 °C. Which statement is the best explanation of these 
data? (a) Chloroform can hydrogen-bond, but carbon tet-
rachloride cannot. (b) Carbon tetrachloride has a larger 
dipole moment than chloroform. (c) Carbon tetrachloride 
is more polarizable than chloroform.
 11.31  A number of salts containing the tetrahedral polyatomic 
anion, BF4
-, are ionic liquids, whereas salts containing the 
somewhat larger tetrahedral ion SO4
2 -  do not form ionic 
liquids. Explain this observation.
