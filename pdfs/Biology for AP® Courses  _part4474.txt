Classical Conditioning
In classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously

36.41). In Pavlov’s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned

response was the ringing of a bell. During conditioning, every time the animal was gi
