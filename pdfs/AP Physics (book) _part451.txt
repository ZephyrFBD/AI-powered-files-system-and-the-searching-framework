CHAPTER 4
Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion
A: No force is needed. The car accelerates out from under the
cup, which tends to remain at rest. Think of Newton’s first
law (see Example 4–1).
B: (a).
C: (i) The same; (ii) the tennis ball; (iii) Newton’s third law
for part (i), second law for part (ii).
D: (b).
E: (b).
F: (b).
G: (c).
H: Yes; no.

showing the forces on the boulder, on the car,
and exerted by the person. (b) The free-body
diagram: forces on a small segment of rope.
1. (a) Finding her car stuck in the mud, a bright graduate of a
good physics course ties a strong rope to the back bumper
of the car, and the other end to a boulder, as shown in 
Fig. 4–78a. She pushes at the midpoint of the rope with 
her maximum effort, which she estimates to be a for
