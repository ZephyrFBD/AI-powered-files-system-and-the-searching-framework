less dense as a solid than as a liquid.
One remarkable consequence of hydrogen bonding is seen in the densities of ice and 
liquid water. In most substances the molecules in the solid are more densely packed than 
those in the liquid, making the solid phase denser than the liquid phase. By contrast, the 
density of ice at 0 °C 10.917 g>mL2 is less than that of liquid water at 0 °C 11.00 g>mL2, so 
ice floats on liquid water.
The lower density of ice can be understood in terms of hydrogen bonding. In ice, 
the H2O molecules assume the ordered, open arrangement shown in Figure 11.11. This
