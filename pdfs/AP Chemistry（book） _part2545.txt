 (Section 4.1) As noted in Section 16.3, we use H3O+1aq2 and H+1aq2 
interchangeably to represent the hydrated proton in water. Thus, we can simplify this 
acid ionization equation to
 
HNO31aq2 ยก H+1aq2 + NO3
-1aq2 
In an aqueous solution of a strong acid, the acid is normally the only significant 
source of H+ ions.* As a result, calculating the pH of a solution of a strong monoprotic 
acid is straightforward because 3H+4 equals the original concentration of acid. In a 0.20 M 
 
solution of HNO31aq2, for example, 3H+4 = 3NO3
-4 = 0.20 M. The situation with the 
diprotic acid H2SO4 is somewhat more complex, as we will see in Section 16.6.

If a colorless solution turns pink when we add phenolphthalein, 
what can we conclude about the pH of the solution?
