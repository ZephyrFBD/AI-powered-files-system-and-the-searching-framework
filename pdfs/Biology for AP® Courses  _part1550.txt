ed with a phosphodiester
linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of
pyrimidine dimers.
Figure 14.19 Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other
can form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.
A well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure
14.20). Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed
to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to
repair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal
individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA
double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA re
