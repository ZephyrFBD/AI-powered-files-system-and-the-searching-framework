At low speeds,
the relativistic formula for kinetic energy reduces to
the classical one, as we now show by using the binomial expansion (Appendix A):
keeping only two terms because
is very 
much less than 1. With 
we expand the square root in Eq. 26–5a
so that
The dots in the first expression represent very small terms in the expansion which
we neglect since we assumed that
Thus at low speeds, the relativistic
form for kinetic energy reduces to the classical form,
This makes
