ia dehydration synthesis. Hydroxyl groups on a glycerol
backbone react with the carboxyl groups of three fatty acids to form ester
bonds and release three molecules of water. Primarily stored in adipose
(fat) tissue, triglycerides are a major form of energy storage.
Phospholipids, like fats, are composed of glycerol and fatty acid chains.
However, instead of three fatty acids, phospholipids have two fatty acids
and a modified phosphate group. The phosphate group or head is
negatively charged, polar, and hydrophilic, whereas the fatty acids or tails
are unsaturated, uncharged, nonpolar, and hydrophobic. This makes
phospholipids amphipathic (containing both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic regions).
As the major components of the plasma membrane, phospholipids are
arranged in a bilayer with the heads facing outward toward the
intracellular and extracellular fluids and the tails facing inward to prevent
them from contacting water. The phospholipids’ chemical and physical
characteristics cause
