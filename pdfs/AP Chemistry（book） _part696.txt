s the direction. A 
positive value of ∆E results when Efinal 7 Einitial, indicating that the system has gained 
energy from its surroundings. A negative value of ∆E results when Efinal 6 Einitial, indi-
cating that the system has lost energy to its surroundings. Notice that we are taking the 
point of view of the system rather than that of the surroundings in discussing the energy

changes. We need to remember, however, that any increase in the energy of the system 
is accompanied by a decrease in the energy of the surroundings, and vice versa. These 
features of energy changes are summarized in Figure 5.5.
In a chemical reaction, the initial state of the system refers to the reactants and the 
final state refers to the products. In the reaction
2 H21g2 + O21g2 ¡  2 H2O1l2
for instance, the initial state is 2 H21g2 + O21g2 and the final state is
