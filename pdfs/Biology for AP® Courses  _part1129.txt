e sister chromatids separate. The nucleus reforms and the cell divide.

During prophase, the “first phase,” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles, and the membranous
organelles (such as the Golgi complex or Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum), fragment and disperse toward
the periphery of the cell. The nucleolus disappears (disperses). The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the
cell. Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the
microtubule fibers lengthen. The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become
visible under a light microscope.
During prometaphase, the “first change phase,” many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance. The
remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and
stretch across the length of t
