rs, go to the park and play, do anything 
 
 ye like and don’t come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, 
 
 not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It’s cold but we 
 
 don’t care.We push the pram up O’Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra 
 
 or the Rosbrien Road.We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at 
 
 cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under 
 
 the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie’s mouth till he’s full and throws 
 
 it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. 
 
 Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in 
 
 me arms.Then he has a great notion,Why can’t we go to our own house 
 
 and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush 
 
 to Roden Lane.There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have 
 
 a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us 
 
 247 
 
 drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptori
