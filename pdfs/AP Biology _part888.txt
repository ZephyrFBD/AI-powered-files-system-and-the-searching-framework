Below is a sketch of a molecule of the sex hormone, testosterone,
that is derived from cholesterol.
Which of the following statements best describes the action of this
hormone on cells of the human gonads?
The hormone acts as the first messenger when it binds to and
activates the G protein-coupled receptor on the surface of cells
in the testes. This activates the mobile G protein located inside
the cell.
The hormone enters cells in the testes by first binding with a
membrane receptor, which causes a channel to open in the
membrane, allowing the testosterone to flood into the cell.
The hormone readily passes through the cell membrane and
binds to a receptor in the cytoplasm. The hormone and receptor

on one or more genes.
The hormone binds with cAMP on the surface of the cell. Once
