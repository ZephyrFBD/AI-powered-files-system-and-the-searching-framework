n example of a state function, a 
property of a system that is determined by specifying the system’s condition, or state (in 
terms of temperature, pressure, and so forth). The value of a state function depends only on 
the present state of the system, not on the path the system took to reach that state. Because E is a 
state function, ∆E depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on how 
the change occurs.
Endothermic and Exothermic Processes
Because transfer of heat to and from the system is central to our discussion in this 
chapter, we have some special terminology to indicate the direction of transfer. When 
a process occurs in which the system absorbs heat, the process is called endothermic 
(endo- means “into”). During an endothermic process, such as the melting of ice, heat 
flows into the system from its surroundings [Figure 5.8(a)]. If we, as part of the surround-
ings, touch a container in which ice is melting, the container feels cold to us because
