EVO-1.D
Explain how natural selection 
affects populations.
EVO-1.D.1
Evolutionary fitness is measured by 
reproductive success.
EVO-1.D.2
Biotic and abiotic environments can be more or 
less stable/fluctuating, and this affects the rate 
and direction of evolution; different genetic 
variations can be selected in each generation.
