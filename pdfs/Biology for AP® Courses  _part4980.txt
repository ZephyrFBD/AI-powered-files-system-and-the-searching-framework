Rothschild banking dynasty, and Jesuit-educated fraudulent Jew,
Adam Weishaupt, and this led to the formation of the Bavarian
Illuminati, ﬁrstly under another name, in 1776. The Illuminati would
be the manipulating force behind the French Revolution (1789-1799)
and was also involved in the American Revolution (1775-1783)
before and aĞer the Illuminati’s oﬃcial creation. Weishaupt would
later become (in public) a Protestant Christian in archetypal
Sabbatian style. I read that his name can be decoded as Adam-Weis-
haupt or ‘the ﬁrst man to lead those who know’. He wasn’t a leader
in the sense that he was a subordinate, but he did lead those below
him in a crusade of transforming human society that still continues
today. The theme was conﬁrmed as early as 1785 when a horseman
courier called Lanz was reported to be struck by lighting and
extensive Illuminati documents were found in his saddlebags. They
made the link to Weishaupt and detailed the plan for world takeover.
