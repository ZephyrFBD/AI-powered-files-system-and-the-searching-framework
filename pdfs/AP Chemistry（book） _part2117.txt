thalpy of solution for CaCl2 is ∆H = -81.3 kJ>mol. If the final temperature of the solution is 27 °C, what 
was its initial temperature? (Assume that the density of the solution is 1.00 g>mL, that its specific heat is 4.18 J>g@K, and that 
the solution loses no heat to its surroundings.)
 
Soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes. 
 (Sec-
tions 4.1 and 4.3) Thus, CaCl2 consists of metal cations 
1Ca2+2 and nonmetal anions 1Cl-2. When completely 
dissociated, each CaCl2 unit forms three ions (one Ca2+ 
and two Cl-). Hence, the calculated osmotic pressure is:
(a) The osmotic pressure is given by Equation 13.14, 
Π = iMRT. We know the temperature, 
T = 27 °C = 300 K, and the gas constant, 
R = 0.0821 L@atm/mol@K. We can calculate the molarity 
of the solution from the mass of CaCl2 and the volume of 
the solution:
