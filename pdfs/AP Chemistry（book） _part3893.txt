CHAPTER 24 The Chemistry of Life: Organic and Biological Chemistry
Deoxyribose differs from ribose only in having one fewer oxygen atom at carbon 2.
There are five nitrogen-containing bases in nucleic acids:
The first three bases shown here are found in both DNA and RNA. Thymine occurs only 
in DNA, and uracil occurs only in RNA. In either nucleic acid, each base is attached to a 
five-carbon sugar through a bond to the nitrogen atom shown in color.
The nucleic acids RNA and DNA are polynucleotides formed by 
condensation reactions between a phosphoric acid OH group on 
one nucleotide and a sugar OH group on another nucleotide. Thus, 
the polynucleotide strand has a backbone consisting of alternating
