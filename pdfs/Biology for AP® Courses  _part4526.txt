uld be greater for a flea as flea
reproduces at a faster rate than elephant. A
shorter time scale would be used to study
changes over several flea generations than over
several elephant generations.
c.
rmax would be greater for a flea as flea
reproduces at a faster rate than elephant. A
longer time scale would be used to study
changes over several flea generations than over
several elephant generations.
d.
rmax would be greater for an elephant as the
elephants grow at an exponential rate so the
population growth rate is greatly increased. A
shorter time scale would be used to study
changes over several elephant generations.

These data were collected on a population of beetles in
Florida. Based on the data, how would you describe
population growth in this case and what do you predict
about growth of this population in the future? Explain your
reasoning.
a.
Population shows logistic growth, as number of
individuals doubles every month and will likely
continue to grow logistically unt
