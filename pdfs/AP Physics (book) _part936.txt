ge in Fig. 9–10, the force can be in any
direction and we can know the direction only after solving the equations. (The
hinge is assumed small and smooth, so it can exert no internal torque on the beam.)
Hinged beam and cable. A uniform beam, 2.20 m long with
mass
is mounted by a small hinge on a wall as shown in Fig. 9–10.
The beam is held in a horizontal position by a cable that makes an angle
The beam supports a sign of mass 
suspended from its end. Deter-
mine the components of the force 
that the (smooth) hinge exerts on the beam,
and the tension 
in the supporting cable.
APPROACH Figure 9–10 is the free-body diagram for the beam, showing all
the forces acting on the beam. It also shows the components of 
and a guess
for the direction of 
We have three unknowns,
and 
(we are
given ), so we will need all three equations,
SOLUTION The sum of the forces in the vertical (y) direction is
(i)
In the horizontal (x) direction, the sum of the forces is
(ii)
For the torque equation, we choo
