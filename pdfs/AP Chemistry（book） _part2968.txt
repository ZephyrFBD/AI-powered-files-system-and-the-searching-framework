ater for the 
people who live in the region, although more than 75% of 
the water that is pumped from it is for irrigation. Irrigation 
withdrawals are approximately 18 billion gallons per day. 
(a) Assuming that 2% of the rainfall that falls on an area 
of 600,000 km2 recharges the aquifer, what average annual 
rainfall would be required to replace the water removed for 
irrigation? (b) What process or processes accounts for the 
presence of arsenic in well water?
Human Activities and Water Quality  
(Section 18.4)
 18.45  Suppose that one wishes to use reverse osmosis to reduce 
the salt content of brackish water containing 0.22 M 
total salt concentration to a value of 0.01 M, thus render-
ing it usable for human consumption. What is the mini-
mum pressure that needs to be applied in the permeators 
 
(Figure 18.20) to achieve this goal, assuming that the oper-
ation occurs at 298 K? (Hint: Refer to Section 13.5.)
 18.46  Assume that a portable reverse-osmosis apparatus oper-
