Rolling Motion (Without Slipping)
205
Figure 8–8a shows a wheel rolling to the right without slipping. At the instant
shown, point P on the wheel is in contact with the ground and is momentarily 
at rest. (If P was not at rest, the wheel would be slipping.) The velocity of the axle
at the wheel’s center C is 
In Fig. 8–8b we have put ourselves in the refere
