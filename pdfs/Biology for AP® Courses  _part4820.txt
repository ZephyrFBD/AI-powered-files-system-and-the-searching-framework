listed species but is hampered by procedural difficulties and a focus on individual species. The Migratory Bird Act is an
agreement between Canada and the United States to protect migratory birds. The non-profit sector is also very active in
conservation efforts in a variety of ways.
Conservation preserves are a major tool in biodiversity protection. Presently, 11percent of Earthâ€™s land surface is protected
in some way. The science of island biogeography has informed the optimal design of preserves; however, preserves have

outside the preserves.
Habitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to previous biodiversity levels before s
