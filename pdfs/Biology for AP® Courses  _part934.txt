However, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight.

What Is Light Energy?
The sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy). Humans can see only a fraction of this
energy, which portion is therefore referred to as “visible light.” The manner in which solar energy travels is described
as waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength, the distance between
consecutive points of a wave. A single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from
trough to trough (Figure 8.10).
