 are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained.
Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. Using the negative logarithm to generate positive
integers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high
pH. An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution, usually by having one of
its hydrogen atoms dissociate. A base provides either hydroxide ions (OHâ€“) or other negatively charged ions that combine
with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. In cases where the base releases
hydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.
The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates into
hydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic, whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not co
