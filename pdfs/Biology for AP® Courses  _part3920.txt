ts processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.
The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune
response about the presence of these antigens. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) is an immune cell that detects, engulfs,
and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose
the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. Antigen fragments will then be transported to
the surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. Dendritic cells are immune cells that
process antigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and
intestines. Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning
as an antigen-presenting cell. Macrophages also function as APCs. Before activatio
