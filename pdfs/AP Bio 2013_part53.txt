 various distances from a lamp, and then all samples were exposed to white light from the 
lamp for 60 minutes at room temperature. Sample 3 was wrapped in foil to prevent any light from reaching the 
solution. At 20-minute intervals, the photosynthetic activity in each sample was determined by measuring the 
relative absorbance of 605 nm light. The results of the experiment are provided below.

indication that light is required for the activation 
of electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts?
