d interpret entire genomes.
Whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding,
exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose
intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome
sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-
marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be
successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing.
