oat with respect to the Water.
(This is also what the boat’s velocity would be relative to the shore if the 
water were still.) Similarly,
is the velocity of the Boat with respect to the Shore,
and 
is the velocity of the Water with respect to the Shore (this is the river
current). Note that 
is what the boat’s motor produces (against the water),
whereas 
is equal to 
plus the effect of the current,
Therefore, the
velocity of the boat relative to the shore is (see vector diagram, Fig. 3–28)
(3;7)
By writing the subscripts using this convention, we see that the inner subscripts
(the two W’s) on the right-hand side of Eq. 3–7 are the same; also, the outer 
subscripts on the right of Eq. 3–7 (the B and the S) are the same as the two
subscripts for the sum vector on the left,
By following this convention (first
subscript for the object, second for the reference frame), you can write down the
correct equation relating velocities in different reference frames.†
Equation 3–7 is valid in gener
