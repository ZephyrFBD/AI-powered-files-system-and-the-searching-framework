To locate a gene, go to the Entrez Gene* section of the NCBI website  
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) and search for the gene. Once you have found 
the gene on the website, copy the gene sequence and input it into a BLAST query. Ask 
students to determine the function of proteins in humans and then to predict if they will 
find the same protein (and related gene) in other organisms. Do students understand 
that BLAST analyses provide only one piece of evidence about speciation and the 
phylogenetic relationships of organisms? Is DNA evidence more or less important to 
evolutionary studies as compared to morphological evidence?
