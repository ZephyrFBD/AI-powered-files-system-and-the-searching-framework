cal energy in an ecosystem.
There are two types of primary productivity:
1. The gross productivity just from photosynthesis cannot be measured because cell respiration is occurring at the
same time.
2. Net productivity measures only organic materials that are left over after photosynthetic organisms have taken
care of their own cellular energy needs. This is calculated by measuring oxygen production in the light, when
both photosynthesis and cell respiration are occurring. The equation for this relationship is listed on the Biology
Equations and Formulas sheet.
Chemosynthetic
There is another group of autotrophs that are not photosynthetic and instead
are chemosynthetic and can take up nutrients from their surroundings and
make their own energy in the absence of oxygen.
Autotrophs produce all of the available food. They make up the first trophic (feeding) level. They also possess the
highest biomass (the total weight of all the organisms in an area) and the greatest numbers. Did you kn
