ium is simply the sum of 
the equilibrium partial pressures:

= 2.67 atm + 6.14 atm + 6.14 atm = 14.95 atm
(d) In discussing Le Châtelier’s principle, we saw that endothermic 
reactions exhibit an increase in Kp with increasing temperature. 
Because the equilibrium constant for this reaction increases as 
temperature increases, the reaction must be endothermic. From 
the enthalpies of formation given in Appendix C, we can verify 
our prediction by calculating the enthalpy change for the reaction:
∆H ° = ∆Hf°1CO1g22 + ∆Hf°1H21g22 - ∆Hf°1C1s, graphite22
- ∆Hf°1H2O1g22 = +131.3 kJ

The positive sign for ∆H ° indicates that the reaction is 
endothermic.
(e) According to Le Châtelier’s principle, a decrease in the pressure 
causes a gaseous equilibrium to shift toward the side of the equa-
tion with the greater number of moles of gas. In this case, there 
are 2 mol of gas on the product side and only one on the reacta
