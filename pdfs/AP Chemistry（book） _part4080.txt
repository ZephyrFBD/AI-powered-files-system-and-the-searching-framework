ken while the mol-
ecule is adsorbed, so that the H atom moves off as an adsorbed atom 
and is replaced by a D atom. This requires a larger activation energy 
than simply adsorbing C2H4 and adding one D atom to each carbon. 
 
14.85 Carbonic anhydrase lowers the activation energy of the reaction 
by 42 kJ. 14.87 (a) The catalyzed reaction is approximately 10,000,000 
times faster at 25 °C (b) The catalyzed reaction is 180,000 times faster 
at 125 °C. 14.91 (a) Rate = 4.7 * 10-5 M  >  s (b, c) k = 0.84 M-2s-1 
(d) If the [NO] is increased by a factor of 1.8, the rate would increase 
by a factor of 3.2. 14.95 (a) The reaction is second order in NO2.  
(b) If 3NO240 = 0.100 M and 3NO24t = 0.025 M, use the inte-
grated form of the second-order rate equation to solve for t. t = 48 s 
14.99 (a) The half-life of 241Am is 4.3 * 102 yr, that of 125I is 63 
days (b) 125I decays at a much faster rate. (c) 0.13 mg of each isotope 
remains after 3 half-lives. (d) The amount of 241Am remaining after
