e to write the electron configuration of selenium (Se, ele-
ment 34). We first locate Se in the table and then move backward from it through the 
table, from element 34 to 33 to 32, and so forth, until we come to the noble gas that pre-
cedes Se. In this case, the noble gas is argon, Ar, element 18. Thus, the noble-gas core for 
Se is [Ar]. Our next step is to write symbols for the outer electrons. We do this by moving 
across period 4 from K, the element following Ar, to Se:

Because K is in the fourth period and the s block, we begin with the 4s electrons, meaning 
our first two outer electrons are written 4s2. We then move into the d block, which begins 
with the 3d electrons. (The principal quantum number in the d block is always one less 
than that of the preceding elements in the s block, as seen in Figure 6.30.) Traversing 
the d bloc
