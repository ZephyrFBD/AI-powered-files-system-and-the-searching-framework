hich is connected to a dangling mass (mass m) through a
central hole as shown in Fig. 5–46. Show that the speed of
the puck is given by v = 1mgRM.
1.50 * 1011 m.
71. In a “Rotor-ride” at a carnival, people rotate in a vertical
cylindrically walled “room.” (See Fig. 5–47.) If the room
radius is 5.5 m, and the rotation frequency 0.50 revolu-
tions per second when the floor drops out, what minimum
coefficient of static friction keeps the people from slipping
down? People on this ride said they were “pressed against
the wall.” Is there really an outward force pressing them
against the wall? If so, what is its source? If not, what is 
the proper description of their situation (besides nausea)?
[Hint: Draw a free-body diagram for a person.]
