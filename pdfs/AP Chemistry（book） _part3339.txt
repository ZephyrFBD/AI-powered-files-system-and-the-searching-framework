e the source of the energy in nuclear power 
plants, nuclear weapons, and stars. They are involved in various radia-
tion therapies utilized to both diagnose and treat diseases. In addition, 
radioactive elements are used to help determine the mechanisms of 
chemical reactions, to trace the movement of atoms in biological sys-
tems and in the environment, and to date historical artifacts.
Nuclear reactions can release enormous amounts of energyâ€”far 
more than the amounts involved in even the most energetic chemical 
reactions. Our chapter-opening photo shows the surface of the Sun. The 
tremendous energy that it releases is generated by nuclear reactions, prin-
cipally by fusing hydrogen nuclei to form helium nuclei. Without nuclear 
reactions, there would be no sunlight and consequently no life on Earth.

In our study of the structure and 
properties of matter, we have seen electrons as 
the major players. Chemical reactions involve 
the making and breaking of bonds, resulting in
