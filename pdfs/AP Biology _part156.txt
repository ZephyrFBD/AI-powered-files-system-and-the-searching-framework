Questions 19–20
The following two questions refer to one experiment.
Two researchers performed an experiment based on their hypothesis
that the progression of the cell cycle is controlled by molecules from
within the cytoplasm. To investigate this hypothesis, they chose
cultured mammalian cells in different phases of the cell cycle and
induced them to fuse. Below is a sketch of two of the cells at the
beginning of the experiment.
Assuming that the researchers’ hypothesis is correct, choose the
image that correctly predicts the result of the experiment after
fusion.

Refer to the same two cells sketched in Question 19. If the
progression of the phases of the cell cycle was not triggered by
molecules from the cytosol, but instead each cell moved into the
next phase automatically after completion of its current phase,
