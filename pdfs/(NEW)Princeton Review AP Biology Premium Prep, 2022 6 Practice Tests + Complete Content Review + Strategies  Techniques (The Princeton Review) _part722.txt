uct a graph plotting the mean jump height and confidence intervals represented by error bars.
1 point—proper axes
1 point—choice of a bar chart or histogram
1 point—proper size of bars showing mean
1 point—graphing confidence intervals as error bars

c. Identify (1 point) which of the locations showed statistical differences in jump height compared to the
Scotland sharks. Explain (1 point) how you know this.
Isle of Man and Cornwall are statistically different in jump height compared to Scotland. I can see this due to the
non-overlapping error bars.
d. Basking sharks are endotherms like most other sharks. Predict (1 point) how the environment may differ
between the Cornwall sampling site and the Isle of Man site. Justify (1 point) your prediction.
As basking sharks are endothermic, this means that the temperature of their environment determines their
metabolism. Therefore, higher temperatures would mean increased activity. S
