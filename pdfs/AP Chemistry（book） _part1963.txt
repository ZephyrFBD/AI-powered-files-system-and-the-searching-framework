ich the lattice points are located only 
at the corners of the unit cell: square, hexagonal, rectangular, rhom-
bic, and oblique. In three dimensions the unit cell is a parallelepiped 
whose size and shape are defined by three lattice vectors (a, b, and c), 
and there are seven primitive lattices: cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, 
rhombohedral, orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic. Placing 
an additional lattice point at the center of a cubic unit cell leads to 
a body-centered cubic lattice, while placing an additional point at the 
center of each face of the unit cell leads to a face-centered cubic lattice.
METALLIC SOLIDS (SECTION 12.3) Metallic solids are typically 
good conductors of electricity and heat, malleable, which means that 
they can be hammered into thin sheets, and ductile, which means 
that they can be drawn into wires. Metals tend to form structures 
where the atoms are closely packed. Two related forms of close pack-
ing, cubic close packing and hexagonal close packi
