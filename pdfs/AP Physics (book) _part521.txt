urbations later led to the discovery of Neptune. Deviations 
in the orbit of Uranus could not all be accounted for by perturbations 
due to the other known planets. Careful calculation in the nineteenth century
indicated that these deviations could be accounted for if another planet existed
farther out in the solar system. The position of this planet was predicted from 
the deviations in the orbit of Uranus, and telescopes focused on that region of 
the sky quickly found it; the new planet was called Neptune. Similar but much
smaller perturbations of Neptune’s orbit led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930.
