Learning Objective 
3.36: The student is able to describe a model that expresses 
the key elements of signal transduction pathways by 
which a signal is converted to a cellular response.
(A)
This option is incorrect. ADH stimulates the production of aquaporins. Inhibition 
of ADH would result in fewer aquaporins. 
(B)
This option is incorrect because inhibition of ADH causes more water to be 
excreted from the body, thus triggering thirst rather than decreasing it.
(C)
This option is incorrect because filtration of the blood in the kidney is 
independent of ADH.
(D)
This option is correct because it links the signal (ADH) with the response 
(reabsorption of water). Because ADH increases reabsorption of water, its  
lack would result in less water reabsorbed, more excreted, and thus a more 
dilute urine.
