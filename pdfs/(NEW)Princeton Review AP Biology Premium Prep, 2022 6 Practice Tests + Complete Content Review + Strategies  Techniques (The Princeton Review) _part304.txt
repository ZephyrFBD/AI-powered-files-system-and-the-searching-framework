 color blindness and hemophilia, are carried on
sex chromosomes. These are called sex-linked traits. Most sex-linked traits are found on the X chromosome and are
more properly referred to as “X-linked.”
Since males have one X and one Y chromosome, what happens if a male has an X-chromosome with the color
blindness allele? Unfortunately, he’ll express the sex-linked trait, even if it is recessive. Why? Because his one and
only X chromosome is color blind-X. He doesn’t have another X to mask the effect of the color blind-X. However,
if a female has only one color blind-X chromosome, she won’t express a recessive sex-linked trait. For her to
express the trait, she has to inherit two color blind-X chromosomes. A female with one color blind-X is called a
carrier. Although she does not exhibit the trait, she can still pass it on to her children.
Both red/green color blindness and hemophilia are X-linked recessive traits.
Other X-linked traits are dominant, meaning only one copy of the mutant
