*21–11 Magnetic Energy Storage
*47. (I) The magnetic field inside an air-filled solenoid 36 cm
long and 2.0 cm in diameter is 0.72 T. Approximately how
much energy is stored in this field?
*48. (II) At 
the current through a 45.0-mH inductor is
50.0 mA and is increasing at the rate of 
What is
the initial energy stored in the inductor, and how long does
it take for the energy to increase by a factor of 5.0 from the
initial value?
*49. (II) Assuming the Earth’s magnetic field averages about
near Earth’s surface, estimate the total energy
stored in this field in the first 10 km above Earth’s surface.
*21–12 LR Circuit
*50. (II) It takes 2.56 ms for the current in an LR circuit to
increase from zero to 0.75 its maximum value. Determine
(a) the time constant of the circuit, (b) the resistance of the
circuit if
*51. (II) How many time constants does it take for the
potential difference ac
