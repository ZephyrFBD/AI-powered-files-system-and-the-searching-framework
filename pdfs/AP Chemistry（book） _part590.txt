Solve
(a)  
When bonded to a nonmetal, hydrogen has an oxidation 
number of +1. Because the H2S molecule is neutral, the sum 
of the oxidation numbers must equal zero. Letting x equal the 
oxidation number of S, we have 21+12 + x = 0. Thus, S has 
an oxidation number of -2.
(b)  
Because S8 is an elemental form of sulfur, the oxidation num-
ber of S is 0.
(c)  
Because SCl2 is a binary compound, we expect chlorine to 
have an oxidation number of -1. The sum of the oxidation 
numbers must equal zero. Letting x equal the oxidation num-
ber of S, we have x + 21-12 = 0. Consequently, the oxidation 
number of S must be +2.
(d)  
Sodium, an alkali metal, always has an oxidation number of 
+1 in its compounds. Oxygen commonly has an oxidation 
state of -2. Letting x equal the oxidation number of S, we 
have 21+12 + x + 31-22 = 0. Therefore, the oxidation num-
ber of S in this compound 1Na2SO32 is +4.
(e)  
The oxidation state of O is -2. The sum of the oxidation num-
bers equals -2, the net
