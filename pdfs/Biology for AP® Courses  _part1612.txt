chondria are
destroyed prior to fertilization.
A. Explain how point mutations in mtDNA can result in a
loss of function in critical cellular components such as
cytochrome c yet not be lethal to the cell.
B. Oocyte mitochondria are randomly segregated during
meiosis, resulting in variation in the frequency of mtDNA
mutations in offspring relative to the parent. Explain how
a loss of function does not accumulate, lowering the
metabolic performance from generation to generation.
As described in the Evolution Connection in this chapter
of the text, a fossil fingertip found in a Siberian cave
revealed an evolutionary link between Neanderthals and
Denisovans. Fossils from 28 individuals were located in
the “pit of bones,” Sima de los Huesos, in Spain,
thousands of miles from the Siberian cave. In 2013,
mtDNA from a femur of one of these individuals was
compared with mtDNA of Denisovans, Neanderthals, and
modern humans. It was found that the Sima fossil shared
many more alleles with Denisovan
