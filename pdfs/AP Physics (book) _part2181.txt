Earth’s Magnetic Field
The Earth’s magnetic field is shown in Fig. 20–5, and is thought to be produced
by electric currents in the Earth’s molten iron outer core. The pattern of field
lines is almost as though there were an imaginary bar magnet inside the Earth.
Since the north pole (N) of a compass needle points north, the Earth’s magnetic
pole which is in the geographic north is magnetically a south pole, as indicated in
Fig. 20–5 by the S on the schematic bar magnet inside the Earth. Remember that
the north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.
Nonetheless, Earth’s pole in the north is still often called the “north magnetic
pole,” or “geomagnetic north,” simply because it is in the north. Similarly, the
Earth’s southern magnetic pole, which is near the geographic south pole, is mag-
netically a north pole (N). The Earth’s magnetic poles do not coincide with the
