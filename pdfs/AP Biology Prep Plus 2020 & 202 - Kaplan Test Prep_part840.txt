ﬀects of interactions between prey and study
species density.
(A)
The researcher conducts three experiments. In one, she
manipulates light levels. In a second, she manipulates prey
availability. In a third, she manipulates light levels and prey
availability to examine the eﬀects of interactions between
light levels and prey availability.
(B)
The researcher conducts two experiments. In one, she
manipulates the number of cover objects available for the
animals to use for shelter. In another, she manipulates the
amount of light available in the study areas.
(C)
The researcher conducts a single experiment in which she
compares animals with high light levels and high prey density
to animals with low light levels and low prey density.
(D)
