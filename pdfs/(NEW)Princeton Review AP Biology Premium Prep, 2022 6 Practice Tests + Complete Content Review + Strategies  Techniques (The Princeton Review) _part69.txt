A
A true-breeding white nettle would be homozygous dominant (WW). A true breeding pink nettle would be
homozygous recessive (ww). All offspring would inherit one dominant allele and one recessive allele, so
they would all be heterozygous (Ww). Heterozygous nettles would display the dominant white phenotype.
46.
C
The F1 generation refers to the first generation of offspring. The previous question determined that all of
the offspring from the first cross would be heterozygous. If the heterozygote offspring was taken and
crossed with a true-breeding pink nettle, which would be homozygous recessive (ww), half of the
offspring would be Ww and half would be ww. The ww offspring would have pink flowers.
47.
B
The heterozygote (WwSs) would be crossed with a nettle recessive for both traits (wwss). If the genes
were not linked, the flowers should be equally white/ruffled, white/slotted, pink/ruffled, and pink/slotted.
If the genes are linked, then some combinations of color/
