he form of arsenic(V), there are a number of possible removal strat-
egies. For example, Fe3 +  can be added to precipitate FeAsO4, which is 
then removed by ﬁltration.

CHAPTER 22 Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Oxides of Carbon
Carbon forms two principal oxides: carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide 1CO22. 
Carbon monoxide is formed when carbon or hydrocarbons are burned in a limited supply 
of oxygen:
 
2 C1s2 + O21g2 ¡ 2 CO1g2 
[22.52]
CO is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is toxic because it binds to hemoglobin in the 
blood and thus interferes with oxygen transport. Low-level poisoning results in head-
aches and drowsiness; high-level poisoning can cause death.
Carbon monoxide is unusual in that it has a nonbonding pair of electrons on carbon: 
∶C ‚O∶. It is isoelectronic with N2, so you might expect CO to be equally unreactive. More-
over, both substances have high bond energies (1072 kJ>mol for C ‚O and 941 kJ>mol 
for N ‚N). Because of the lower nuclear charge on ca
