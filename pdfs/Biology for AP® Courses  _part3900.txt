n. Regions of the
body that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as
tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push
the mucus with the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the stomach
(which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of
urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).
Despite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal
surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow
them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds
with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and p
