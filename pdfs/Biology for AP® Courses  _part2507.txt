rmation from clinical records, patient interviews, surveillance, and any other available means. That
information is used to develop strategies, such as vaccinations (Figure 22.26), and design public health
policies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread. Epidemiologists also conduct rapid
investigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it.

epidemiologists are also physicians (and have an M.D.), or they have a Ph.D. in an associated field, such
as biology or microbiology.
