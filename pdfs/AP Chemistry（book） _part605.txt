nic compound dissolves, the relative concentrations of the 
ions in the solution depend on the chemical formula of the compound. For example, a 
1.0 M solution of NaCl is 1.0 M in Na+ ions and 1.0 M in Cl- ions, and a 1.0 M solution of 
Na2SO4 is 2.0 M in Na+ ions and 1.0 M in SO4
2- ions. Thus, the concentration of an elec-
trolyte solution can be specified either in terms of the compound used to make the solu-
tion (1.0 M Na2SO42 or in terms of the ions in the solution (2.0 M Na+ and 1.0 M SO4
2-2.
 
Sample Exercise 4.11 
Calculating Molarity
Calculate the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 23.4 g of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) in enough water to form 125 mL of 
solution.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given the number of grams of solute (23.4 g), its 
chemical formula 1Na2SO4), and the volume of the solution  
(125 mL) and asked to calculate the molarity of the solution.
Plan We can calculate molarity using Equation 4.31. To do so, we 
must convert the number of grams of solute to moles
