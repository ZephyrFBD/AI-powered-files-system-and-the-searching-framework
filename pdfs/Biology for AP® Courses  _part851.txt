glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer period of time during exercise. Glycogen is broken down into G-1-P and
converted into G-6-P in both muscle and liver cells, and this product enters the glycolytic pathway.

Sucrose is a disaccharide with a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose bonded together with a glycosidic linkage.
Fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose (which is part of the milk sugar, the
disaccharide lactose), which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. The catabolism of both fructose
and galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.
Connections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism
Proteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of enzymes in cells. Most of the time, the amino acids are recycled into the synthesis
of new proteins. If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of starvation, some amino acids will be
shunted
