op their seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees, or animals that live in groups (schools
of fish or herds of elephants). Clumped dispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity. Thus, the dispersion
of the individuals within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a
simple density measurement. Just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with
a random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups.
Figure 36.5 Species may have uniform, random, or clumped distribution. Territorial birds such as penguins tend
to have uniform distribution. Plants such as dandelions with wind-dispersed seeds tend to be randomly distributed.
Animals such as elephants that travel in groups exhibit clumped distribution. (credit a: modification of work by Ben
