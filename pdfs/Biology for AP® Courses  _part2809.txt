on, including insects, spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, centipedes, and crustaceans.
Scientists estimate that, of insects alone, there are over 30 million species on our planet. The exoskeleton is a hard covering
or shell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land
animals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles.
As the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin
and is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. This is fused to the animal’s epidermis. Ingrowths of
the exoskeleton, called apodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals
(Figure 24.3). In order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed
or molt the original covering. This limits the animal’s ability to grow continually, and may limit the indiv
