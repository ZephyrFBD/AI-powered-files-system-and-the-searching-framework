drives, tape, flash and external devices are more permanent storage, and they are
much slower to access because the data must be searched for, sequentially, such
as along the circular tracks of hard drives (Fig. 21–27a). Programs, applications,
and data that you want to use are imported by the computer into the RAM from
their more permanent (and more slowly accessed) storage area.†
RAM is based on semiconductor technology, storing the binary bits (“0”or “1”)
as electric charge or voltage. Some computers may use semiconductors also for
long-term storage (“flash memory”) in place of a hard drive.
A common type of RAM is dynamic random access memory or DRAM, which
uses arrays of transistors known as MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor 
field-effect transistors). Transistors will be discussed in Section 29–10, but we
already encountered them in Section 17–11 about TV screen addressing, Fig. 17–34,
which we show again here, Fig. 21–28. A MOSFET transistor in RAM serves
basically as an on–o
