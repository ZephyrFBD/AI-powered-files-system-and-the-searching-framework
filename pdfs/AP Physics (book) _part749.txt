The linear momentum,
of an object is defined as the product
of its mass times its velocity,
(7;1)
In terms of momentum, Newtonâ€™s second law can be written
as
(7;2)
That is, the rate of change of momentum of an object equals
the net force exerted on it.
When the net external force on a system of objects is 
zero, the total momentum remains constant. This is the law of
conservation of momentum. Stated another way, the total
momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.
The law of conservation of momentum is very useful in
dealing with collisions. In a collision, two (or more) objects
interact with each other over a very short time interval, and the
force each exerts on the other during this time interval is very
large compared to any other forces acting.
The impulse delivered by a force on an object is defined as
