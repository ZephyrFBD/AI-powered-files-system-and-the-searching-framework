 to
move right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify
the image. Because of the manner by which light travels through the lenses, this system of two lenses produces an inverted
image (binocular, or dissecting microscopes, work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that
makes the final image appear to be upright).
Light Microscopes
To give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers
(abbreviated as eight Î¼m) in diameter; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter. That
means about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.
Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 4.2a). Visible light passes and is bent through the
lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but
