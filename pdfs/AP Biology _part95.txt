in trees moves by bulk flow from the leaves to the roots due to active
transport in the phloem. Bulk flow movement is always from source
(where it originates) to sink (where it is used).
CELL COMMUNICATION
Whether they are primitive bacterial cells or cells that make up complex
organisms, cells communicate with other cells using chemical signals.

Cell communication is an important topic. Quorum sensing is a great example.
Quorom Sensing in Bacteria
Bacterial cells are able to communicate through a phenomenon called
quorum sensing. This process allows bacteria to monitor their population
density and use that information to control gene expression. Universal
quorum sensing languages even enable bacteria of different species to
“talk” to each other. Many bacterial behaviors are regulated by quorum
sensing, including horizontal gene transfers or the process by which a
harmless bacterium can transform into a virulent one. Here
