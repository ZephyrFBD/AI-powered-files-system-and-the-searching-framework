 
reaction?
(a) Acid rain is no threat to lakes in areas where the rock is limestone (calcium carbonate), which can neutralize the acid. Where 
the rock is granite, however, no neutralization occurs. How does limestone neutralize acid? (b) Acidic water can be treated with 
basic substances to increase the pH, although such a procedure is usually only a temporary cure. Calculate the minimum mass of 
lime, CaO, needed to adjust the pH of a small lake 1V = 4 * 109 L2 from 5.0 to 6.5. Why might more lime be needed?

SOLUTION
Analyze We need to remember what a neutralization reaction is 
and calculate the amount of a substance needed to effect a certain 
change in pH.
Plan For (a), we need to think about how acid can react with calcium 
carbonate, a reaction that evidently does not happen with acid and 
granite. For (b), we need to think about what reaction between an 
acid and CaO is possible and do stoichiometric calculations. From
