lear envelope, lysosomes, and
vesicles, which we’ve already mentioned, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly.

Although not technically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will
see, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles. The endomembrane system does not include the membranes of
either mitochondria or chloroplasts.
Figure 4.18 Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The
RER also sometimes modifies proteins. In this illustration, a (green) integral membrane protein in the ER is
modified by attachment of a (purple) carbohydrate. Vesicles with the integral protein bud from the ER and fuse
with the cis face of the Golgi apparatus. As the protein passes along the Golgi’s cisternae, it is further modified
by the addition of more carbohydrates. After its synthesis is complete, it exits as an integral mem
