15 ATP; acetyl CoA, 12 ATP; NADH, 3 ATP (or 2 ATP if they originate in glycolysis); and
FADH2, 2 ATP. The metabolic pathway that breaks down ethanol to H2O and CO2 in the human liver is variable.
However, answer choice A
 
can be eliminated without knowing how many ATP molecules ethanol can yield because glucose produces more
ATP than does pyruvate.
9. C. When O2 is absent (or very low), anaerobic respiration (alcohol fermentation) is initiated. Alcohol
fermentation releases CO2. Photosynthesis, which would consume CO2 to produce glucose, is
obviously not occurring. This indicates that the plant activity illustrated by the graph is occurring at night (or during
a heavily clouded day).
 
10. C. CO2 is produced in the Krebs cycle. As in the previous question, the production of CO2, rather than its
consumption, indicates that
 
photosynthesis is not occurring, and that the plant activity is taking place at night.
 
11. C. Lactic acid fermentation, the conversion of pyruvate to lactate,
