hivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is 
 
 shivering too but he’s asleep and he doesn’t know he’s cold. I don’t know 
 
 if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering 
 
 the streets when a guard might ask you what you’re doing out. 
 
 It’s my first time away from my family and I know I’d rather be in my 
 
  
  
 own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It’s bad when 
 
 165 
 
 our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it’s worse in 
 
 the Clohessys’ when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory 
 
 and slip on shit all the way down. I’d be better off with four goats in a 
 
 ditch. 
 
 I drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. 
 
 Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up.They all 
 
 went to bed with their clothes on so they don’t have to get dressed and 
 
 there’s no fighting.They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs 
 
 to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too
