wth is that the population growth rate—the number
of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate.
After 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. When the
population size, N, is plotted over time, a J-shaped growth curve is produced (Figure 36.9).
The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. Furthermore, some bacteria will
die during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of
a population, the death rate (D) (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the birth
rate (B) (number organisms that are born during that interval). This is shown in the following formula:
ΔN (change in number)
ΔT (change in time)  = B (birth rate) - D (death rate)
The birth rate is usually expressed on a per capita (for each indi
