n two alleles for a gene, an individual can only have two alleles on
each pair of chromosomes. Ending up with a combination of alleles is
about as simple as tossing a coin.
An organism that is homozygous for a particular gene (AA) produces four
gametes each with an A allele. Each of the gametes is one out of a
possible four gametes, but because all of the gametes have an A, four out
of four of the gametes have an A. Four out of four is a probability of one
because 
. You can look at the question more intuitively by saying
that because there are only A alleles in the parent cell, all of the daughter
cells (100%, or 
 ) will have the A allele. If an organism is heterozygous
(Aa), it produces two gametes with an A allele (2 out of 4) and two
gametes with an a allele (2 out of 4). The probability of either the A or a
allele in the gametes is 
. Or again, intuitively, if the parent cell
has one A and one a allele, it will produce gametes that are half A (50%, or
 ) and half a (50%, or 
 ).
