A certain species of turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) lays its eggs in nests that are buried in the sand. The 
turtle then leaves the eggs to develop. A researcher claims that turtle embryos are able to shift within 
their eggs in response to directional thermal cues in the environment. To test the claim, the researcher 
incubated turtle eggs in containers and used heating pads to deliver heat either to the top of the 
container (dorsal heating) or to one side of the container (lateral heating). The position of the lateral 
heat source was switched from one side to the other on day 15. The researcher recorded the shifts in 
embryo position relative to the initial embryo position in the egg. The results are shown in Figure 1.
