ain.
The enzyme NAD dehydrogenase or FAD dehydrogenase facilitates
the transfer of hydrogen atoms from a substrate, such as glucose, to
its coenzyme NAD+.
Without NAD+ to accept protons and electrons from glycolysis and
the Krebs cycle, both processes would cease and the cell would die.
NAD and FAD are vitamin derivatives.
NAD+ is the oxidized form. NADre or NADH is the reduced form.
NADH carries 1 proton and 2 electrons.
FAD is the oxidized form. FADre or FADH2 is the reduced form.
AEROBIC RESPIRATION: THE ELECTRON
TRANSPORT CHAIN
The electron transport chain (ETC) is a proton pump in the
mitochondria that couples two reactions, one exergonic and one
endergonic. It uses the energy released from the exergonic flow of
electrons to pump protons against a gradient from the matrix to the outer
compartment. This results in the establishment of a proton gradient inside
the mitochondrion. The electron transport chain makes no ATP directly
but sets the stage for ATP production during chemiosmo
