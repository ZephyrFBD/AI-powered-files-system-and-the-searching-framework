and 94 (plutonium, Pu) were produced 
in 1940 by bombarding uranium-238 with neutrons:

Elements with still larger atomic numbers are normally formed in small quantities 
in particle accelerators. Curium-242, for example, is formed when a plutonium-239 tar-
get is bombarded with accelerated alpha particles:

CHAPTER 21 Nuclear Chemistry
New advances in the detection of the decay patterns of single atoms have led to recent 
additions to the periodic table. Between 1994 and 2010, elements 110 through 118 were 
discovered via the nuclear reactions that occur w
