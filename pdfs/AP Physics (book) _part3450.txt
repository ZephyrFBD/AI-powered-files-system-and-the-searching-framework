and his co-workers (at the University of Chicago) showed it was possible by
constructing the first nuclear reactor in 1942 (Fig. 31–6).

FIGURE 31–6 This is the only photograph of the first
nuclear reactor, built by Fermi under the grandstand of
Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. It is shown here
under construction as a layer of graphite (used as
moderator) was being placed over a layer of natural
uranium. On December 2, 1942, Fermi slowly withdrew 
the cadmium control rods and the reactor went critical.
This first self-sustaining chain reaction was announced to
Washington, via telephone, by Arthur Compton who
witnessed the event and reported: “The Italian navigator 
has jus
