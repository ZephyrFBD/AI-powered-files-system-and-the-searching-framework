er-specific channels. Although water is polar, there are
typically sufficient aquaporins for water to traverse the membrane whenever it wishes without forming traffic jams.
However, without aquaporins, no water would be able to cross the membrane. Glucose and ions such as Na+ and K+
are also transported across the plasma membrane via membrane proteins.
Passive Transport: Simple and Facilitated Diffusion
Now we know how things cross the membrane, but let’s talk about why they cross the membrane. The simple
answer is “To get to the other side.” If there is a high concentration of something in one area, it will move to spread
out and diffuse into an area with a lower concentration, even if that means entering or exiting a cell. In other words,
the substance moves down a concentration gradient. This is called diffusion. When the molecule that is diffusing is
hydrophobic, the diffusion is called simple diffusion because the small nonpolar molecule can just drift right
through the membrane w
