Through artificial selection, humans affect 
variation in other species.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
EVO-1
Evolution is characterized by a change in the genetic makeup of a population over 
time and is supported by multiple lines of evidence.

EVO-1.G
Explain the relationship 
between changes in the 
environment and evolutionary 
changes in the population.
EVO-1.G.1
Convergent evolution occurs when similar 
selective pressures result in similar phenotypic 
adaptations in different populations or species.
