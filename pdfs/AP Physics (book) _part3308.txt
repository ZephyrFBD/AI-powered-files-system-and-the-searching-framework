mon transistors consist of three
semiconductor sections, either as pnp or npn. Transistors can
amplify electrical signals and in computers serve as switches or
gates for the 1s and 0s of digital bits. An integrated circuit
consists of a tiny semiconductor crystal or chip on which many
transistors, diodes, resistors, and other circuit elements are
constructed by placement of impurities.

Explain.
4. Although the molecule 
is not stable, the ion 
is.
Explain, using the Pauli exclusion principle.
5. Would you expect the molecule 
to be stable? If so,
where would the single electron spend most of its time?
6. Explain why the carbon atom 
usually forms four
bonds with hydrogen-like atoms.
