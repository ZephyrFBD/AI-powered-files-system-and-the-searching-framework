ding to Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents
are crossed, all of the F1 offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are
dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits, respectively. A self-cross of the F1 heterozygotes results in 2,000 F2
progeny.
Test the hypothesis: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are
each expected to be 3:1. The tall/dwarf trait pair is called T/t, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designated I/
i. Each member of the F1 generation therefore has a genotype of TtIi. Construct a grid analogous to Figure 12.16,
in which you cross two TtIi individuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: TI, Ti, tI, or ti,
meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes. Because the T and I alleles are dominant, any individual
having one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively,
