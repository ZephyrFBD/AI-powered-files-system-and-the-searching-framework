Columnar Epithelia
Columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide: they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer, and are
most commonly found in a single-layer arrangement. The nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to
be lined up at the base of the cells, as illustrated in Figure 24.9. These cells absorb material from the lumen of the digestive
tract and prepare it for entry into the body through the circulatory and lymphatic systems.

Figure 24.9 Simple columnar epithelial cells absorb material from the digestive tract. Goblet cells secret mucous into
the digestive tract lumen.
Columnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified. However, each cell is attached to the base
membrane of the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells,
