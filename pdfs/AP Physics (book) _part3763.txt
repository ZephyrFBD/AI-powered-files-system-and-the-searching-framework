g three neutrino types, which is the number we observe. And it sets an upper limit of
four to the maximum number of possible neutrino types. This is a striking example of the powerful
connection between particle physics and cosmology.
Flatness
First of all, our best measurements suggest that the universe is flat, that it has zero
curvature. As scientists, we would like some reason for this remarkable result. To
see how inflation explains flatness, consider a simple 2-dimensional model of the
universe as we did earlier in Figs. 33–16 and 33–21. A circle in this 2-dimensional
universe (
surface of a sphere, Fig. 33–30a) represents the observable universe as
seen by an observer at the blue dot. A possible hypothesis is that inflation occurred
over a time interval that very roughly doubled the age of the universe from, let us
say,
to 
The size of the observable universe
would have increased by a factor of two during inflation, while the radius
of curvature of the entire universe increased
