A tremendous amount of energy is released in a fission reaction because the
mass of 
is considerably greater than the total mass of the fission fragments
plus released neutrons. This can be seen from the binding-energy-per-nucleon
curve of Fig. 30–1; the binding energy per nucleon for uranium is about
but for fission fragments that have intermediate mass (in the
center portion of the graph,
), the average binding energy per nucleon is
about 
Since the fission fragments are more tightly bound, the
sum of their m
