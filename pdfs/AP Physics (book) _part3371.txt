 to 
and to the total number N of radioactive (parent) nuclei
present:
(30;3a)
where the minus sign means N is decreasing. We rewrite this to get the rate of
decay (number of decays per second):
(30;3b)
In these equations,
is a measurable constant called the decay constant, which 
is different for different isotopes. The greater 
is, the greater the rate 
of decay,
and the more “radioactive” that isotope is said to be.
