in a scientific paper, you go into the 
lab and attempt to prepare crystals of dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)
cobalt(III) chloride. The paper states that this compound can be 
made by reacting CoCl2 # 6 H2O, an excess of ethylenediamine, O2 
from the air (which acts as an oxidizing agent), water, and concen-
trated hydrochloric acid. At the end of the reaction, you filter off the 
solution and are left with a green, crystalline product. (a) What ex-
periment(s) could you perform to confirm that you have prepared 
3CoCl2(en)24Cl and not 3Co(en)34Cl3? (b) How could you verify 
that cobalt was present as Co3+ and determine the spin state of the 
cobalt complex in your product? (c) How many geometric isomers 
exist for 3CoCl2(en)24Cl? How could you determine if your product 
contains a single geometric isomer or a mixture of geometric iso-
mers? (d) If the product does contain a single geometric isomer how 
would you determine which one was present? (Hint: You may find the
