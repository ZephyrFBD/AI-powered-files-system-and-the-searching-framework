ical components of
the motion separately. For convenience, we assume that the motion begins at
time
at the origin of an xy coordinate system (so
).
Let us look at a (tiny) ball rolling off the end of a horizontal table with an 
initial velocity in the horizontal (x) direction,
See Fig. 3–18, where an object
falling vertically is also shown for comparison. The velocity vector at each instant
points in the direction of the ball’s motion at that instant and is thus always tangent
to the path. Following Galileo’s ideas, we treat the horizontal and vertical compo-
nents of velocity and acceleration separately, and we can apply the kinematic
equations (Eqs. 2–11a through 2–11c) to the x and y components of the motion.
First we examine the vertical (y) component of the motion. At the instant 
the ball leaves the table’s top
it has only an x component of velocity.
Once the ball leaves the table (at
), it experiences a vertically downward
acceleration g, the acceleration due to gravity. Thus
