CHAPTER 12 Solids and Modern Materials
For a given ionic compound, we might ask which type of structure is most favorable. 
A number of factors come into play, but two of the most important are the relative sizes 
of the ions and the stoichiometry. Consider first ion size. Notice in Figure 12.26 that the 
coordination number changes from 8 to 6 to 4 on moving from CsCl to NaCl to ZnS. This 
trend is driven in part by the fact that for these three compounds the ionic radius of the 
cation gets smaller while the ionic radius of the anion changes very little. When the cation 
and anion are similar in size, a large coordination number is favored and the CsCl struc-
ture is often realized. As the relative size of
