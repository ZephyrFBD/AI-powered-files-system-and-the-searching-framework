Lewis structures is the most important? One approach is to do some “bookkeeping” of 
the valence electrons to determine the formal charge of each atom in each Lewis structure. 
The formal charge of any atom in a molecule is the charge the atom would have if each 
bonding electron pair in the molecule were shared equally between its two atoms.
How to Calculate the Formal Charges of Atoms in Lewis Structures
  
1. All unshared (nonbonding) electrons are assigned to the atom on which they are 
found.
  
2. For any bond—single, double, or triple—half of the bonding electrons are assigned 
to each atom in the bond.
  
3. The formal charge of each atom is calculated by subtracting the number of electrons 
assigned to the atom from the number of valence electrons in the neutral atom:
