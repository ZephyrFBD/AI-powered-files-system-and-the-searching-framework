d with 
krypton (Kr), atomic number 36, another of the noble gases. Rubidium (Rb) marks the 
beginning of the fifth row. Refer again to the periodic table on the front-inside cover. 
Notice that this row is in every respect like the preceding one, except that the value for n 
is greater by 1.
The Lanthanides and Actinides
The sixth row of the periodic table begins with Cs and Ba, which have 3Xe46s1 and 
3Xe46s2 configurations, respectively. Notice, however, that the periodic table then has a 
break, with elements 57â€“70 placed below the main portion of the table. This break point 
is where we begin to encounter a new set of orbitals, the 4f.
There are seven degenerate 4f orbitals, corresponding to the seven allowed values 
of ml, ranging from 3 to -3. Thus, it takes 14 electrons to fill the 4f orbitals completely. 
The 14 elements corresponding to the filling of the 4f orbitals are known as  
either the 
lanthanide elements or the rare earth elements. These elements are set below 
the o
