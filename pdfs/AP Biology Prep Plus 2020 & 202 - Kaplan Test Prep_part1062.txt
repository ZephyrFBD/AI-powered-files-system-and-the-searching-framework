with arginine, so the
mutation impacted the function of enzyme 4, which catalyzes argininosuccinate. Since
ornithine and citrulline are the first two intermediates, argininosuccinate is the third
intermediate. Mutant 2 grows in all of the media with supplement but not minimal medium
itself, so the mutation impacted the function of enzyme 1.
2. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 2
(a) When algal blooms die, they sink to the bottom of the bay and are decomposed by
bacteria. DescribeÂ what most likely causes the level of dissolved oxygen to dip in the
summer months. (2 points maximum)
Explanation (1 point each, 2 points maximum)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
In the summer, algal blooms consume available nutrients and die when nutrients become
limited. When they die, they are decomposed by bacteria. This decay process consumes
oxygen in the water. In addition, according to the data, the temperature of the water
increases during the summer months, whi
