ot the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting
genotypes, known as the populationâ€™s genetic structure, from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes.
If the phenotype is observed, only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known; the calculations provide
an estimate of the remaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if the allele frequencies (p and q)
are known, predicting the frequencies of these genotypes is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability
of getting these genotypes if two alleles are drawn at random from the gene pool. So in the above scenario, an individual
pea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce yellow peas; pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus producing green peas
(Figure 19.2). In other words, the frequency of pp individuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the
frequency of qq individuals is q2. And, again, if p and q
