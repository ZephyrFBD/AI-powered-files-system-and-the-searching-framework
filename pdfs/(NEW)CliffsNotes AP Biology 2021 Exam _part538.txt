ted, diabetes can result in death.
2. Epinephrine and norepinephrine stimulate the “fight-or-flight” response. This response describes how humans
and other animals respond to life-threatening situations. In response to danger, nerve impulses from the brain
stimulate the adrenal medulla (an endocrine gland attached to the kidneys) to release epinephrine (adrenalin) and
norepinephrine (noradrenalin) . These two hormones, in turn, stimulate the liver and muscle cells to break down
glycogen and release glucose. Glucose provides a source of energy for either fighting or taking flight. In addition,
epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood pressure, breathing rate, and cellular metabolic rates, all of which
promote the fight-or-flight response. When danger passes, the fight-orflight response ends and homeostasis is
established as secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine is discontinued.
3. Thyroxin is an iodine containing hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Thyroxin regulates the m
