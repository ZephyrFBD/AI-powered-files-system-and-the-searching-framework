ome as trisomy 21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total).
Not wanting to change the name of this disease, scientists retained the original numbering system. The chromosome “arms”
projecting from either end of the centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative lengths. The
short arm is abbreviated p (for “petite”), whereas the long arm is abbreviated q (because it follows “p” alphabetically). Each
arm is further subdivided and denoted by a number. For example, locus 3 on the short arm of chromosome 21 is denoted
21p3. Using this naming system, locations on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature.
