The Water (Hydrologic) Cycle
Water is the basis of all living processes. The human body is more than 1/2 water and human cells are more than 70 percent
water. Thus, most land animals need a supply of fresh water to survive. However, when examining the stores of water on
Earth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable salt water (Figure 37.13). Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground
as water or as ice. Thus, less than 1 percent of fresh wa
