for example, are words associated with meiosis but not mitosis. We’ll explain what these words
mean later in this book. For now, just take a look.
8. In mitosis, plant cytokinesis differs from animal cytokinesis. Scientists studying the process have hypothesized
that the Golgi apparatus sends cellulose in vesicles to form a cell plate between plant daughter cells. Which of
the following questions will help guide the scientists toward a direct test of their hypothesis?
(A) In what types of cells do homologous chromosomes exchange DNA through crossing-over?
(B) Are tetrads formed in the center of the cell as a result of plant cytokinesis?
(C) When homologous chromosomes pair up through the process of synapsis, does a cell plate form?
(D) Does cytokinesis still occur in plant cells when Golgi vesicles are inhibited from travelling to the center of
the cell?
