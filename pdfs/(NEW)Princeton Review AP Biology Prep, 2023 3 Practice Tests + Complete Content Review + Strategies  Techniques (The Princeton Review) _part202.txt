atively the same size
all the time. On the other hand, the cell membrane can shrink away from the wall (a process called plasmolysis) if it
loses water and can expand and squeeze tightly against the cell wall if it takes in water.
The term tonicity is used to describe osmotic gradients. If an environment is isotonic to the cell, the solute
concentration is the same inside and outside. A hypertonic solution has more total dissolved solutes than the cell,
while a hypotonic solution has less. The tendency of water to move down its concentration gradient (into or out of
cells) can be a powerful force; it can cause cells to explode and can overcome gravity. You may also hear the terms
isosmotic, hyperosmotic, and hypoosmotic. These words are generally used when comparing two solutions, while
tonicity terms are used when comparing a solution to a cell. Other than this, the definitions are similar; isotonic and
isosmotic both describe situations in which the concentration is the same on eithe
