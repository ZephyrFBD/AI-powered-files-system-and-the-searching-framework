termined. The 
plants in group II were maintained in light for a week. The plants in group III were maintained in the 
dark for a week. All conditions, other than light, were the same for groups II and III. At the end of the 
week, the plants in groups II and III were dried and the mass was determined. The experimental results 
are provided in the table. 
(a) To explain the increase in mass of the light-grown plants, identify ONE inorganic source of new 
plant mass and connect it to the cellular process underlying the increase in mass.

CO2
CO2 incorporated into carbohydrates by photosynthesis 
H2O
H2O incorporated into carbohydrates by photosynthesis 
(b) To explain the decrease in mass of the dark-grown plants, identify the overall chemical reaction 
that is occurring in the plant cells and connect it to the cellular process underlying the decrease in 
mass.
