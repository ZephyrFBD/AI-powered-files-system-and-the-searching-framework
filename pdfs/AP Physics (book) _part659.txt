und,
and the remaining four shelves are each spaced 38.0 cm
above the previous one. If the average book has a mass of
1.40 kg with a height of 22.0 cm, and an average shelf holds
28 books (standing vertically), how much work is required
to fill all the shelves, assuming the books are all laying flat
on the floor to start?
8. (II) A lever such as that shown in Fig. 6–35 can be used to
lift objects we might not otherwise be able to lift. Show
that the ratio of output force,
to input force,
is related to the lengths 
and 
from the pivot by
Ignore friction and the mass of the lever,
and assume the work output equals the work input.

10. (II) A 380-kg piano slides 2.9 m down a 25° incline and is
kept from accelerating by a man who is pushing back on 
it parallel to the incline (Fig. 6–36). Determine: (a) the
force exerted by the man, (b) the work done on the piano
by the man, (c) the work done on the piano by the force of
gravity, and (d) the net work done on
