hysics is the most basic of the sciences. It deals with the behavior and
structure of matter. The field of physics is usually divided into classical
physics which includes motion, fluids, heat, sound, light, electricity, and
magnetism; and modern physics which includes the topics of relativity, atomic
structure, quantum theory, condensed matter, nuclear physics, elementary particles, and
cosmology and astrophysics. We will cover all these topics in this book, beginning
with motion (or mechanics, as it is often called) and ending with the most recent
results in fundamental particles and the cosmos. But before we begin on the
physics itself, we take a brief look at how this overall activity called “science,”
including physics, is actually practiced.
1–1 The Nature of Science
The principal aim of all sciences, including physics, is generally considered to be
the search for order in our observations of the world around us
