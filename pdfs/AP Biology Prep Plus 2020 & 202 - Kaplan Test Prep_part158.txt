AP Biology Lab 4: Diﬀusion and
Osmosis Investigation
AP EXPERT NOTE
This and the other lab sections of this book provide supplemental
information for the 13 laboratory investigations oﬀicially
recommended by the College Board for all AP Biology students.
Many of these lab sections include high-yield content not covered
in other parts of the text, so they are worth reviewing irrespective
of whether you completed the labs in class.
The properties of diﬀusion and osmosis, discussed earlier in this chapter,
will be explored in this investigation. Recall that selectively permeable
membranes let some molecules through but not others. For this
investigation, it is important to know that:
5.5 Investigate eﬀects of tonicity and gradients
Isotonic solutions are two solutions that have the same
concentration of solute.
A hypotonic solution has a lower solute concentration than
another solution.
Keep in mind that water potential is the measure of force a solution has
for pulling or drawing wa
