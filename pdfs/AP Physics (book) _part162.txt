tion and experience? A good check is to
do a rough estimate using only powers of 10, as
discussed in Section 1–7. Often it is preferable to
do a rough estimate at the start of a numerical
problem because it can help you focus your 
attention on finding a path toward a solution.
9. A very important aspect of doing problems is keep-
ing track of units. An equals sign implies the units on
each side must be the same, just as the numbers must.
If the units do not balance, a mistake has been
made. This can serve as a check on your solution
(but it only tells you if you’re wrong, not if you’re
right). Always use a consistent set of units.

1. Read and reread the whole problem carefully before
trying to solve it.
2. Decide what object (or objects) you are going to
study, and for what time interval. You can often
choose the initial time to be
3. Draw a diagram or picture of the situation, with
coordinate axes wherever applicable. [You can place
