 has wavelength equal to the Compton
wavelength of a particle, the photon’s energy is equal to the
rest energy of the particle,
*32. (II) X-rays of wavelength 
are scattered
from carbon. What is the expected Compton wavelength
shift for photons detected at angles (relative to the inci-
dent beam) of exactly (a) 45°, (b) 90°, (c) 180°?
27–6 Pair Production
33. (I) How much total kinetic energy will an electron–positron
pair have if produced by a 3.64-MeV photon?
34. (II) What is the longest wavelength photon that could
produce a proton–antiproton pair? (Each has a mass of
)
35. (II) What is the minimum photon energy needed to
produce a 
pair? The mass of each 
(muon) is 
207 times the mass of an electron. What is the wavelength
of such a photon?
36. (II) An electron and a positron,
each moving at
collide head on, disappear, and produce
two photons, each with the same energy and momentum
moving in opposite directions. Determine the energy and
momentum of each photon.
