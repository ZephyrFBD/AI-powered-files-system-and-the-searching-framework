arameters above. Then 
we can use these data as the total drugs are to distribute. 
Step 2: Estimate the demand of each epidemic area. Change the parameters of 
λ, μ, I0, S0 according to the situation of each epidemic area and repeat using 
Improved Model 2. Then we will get forecast infected people in each area and that is 
the demand of the area. Our team cannot get enough data of each area, so we cannot 
calculate further. 
Step 3: Drugs distribution strategy. First, treatment center distributes drugs to 
each epidemic area every week. They distribute drugs according to the number of 
infected people in each epidemic area. For example, if there are 100 infected people in 
area A1 in the next week, 10 infected people in areaA2, then we distribute 100 units 
of drugs to A1 while 10 to A2 this week. During the period of each week, if area Ai 
is short of drugs while other areas have surplus drugs, then Ai can choose get drugs
