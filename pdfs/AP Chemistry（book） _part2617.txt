G. N. Lewis was the first to notice this aspect of acid–base reactions. He proposed a more 
general definition of acids and bases that emphasizes the shared electron pair:
t A Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor.
t A Lewis base is an electron-pair donor.
Every base that we have discussed thus far—whether OH-, H2O, an amine, or an 
anion—is an electron-pair donor. Everything that is a base in the Brønsted–Lowry sense (a 
proton acceptor) is also a base in the Lewis sense (an electron-pair donor). In the Lewis the-
ory, however, a base can donate its electron pair to something other than H+. The Lewis defi-
nition therefore greatly increases the number of species that can be considered acids; in other 
words, H+ is a Lewis acid but not the only one. For example, the reaction between NH3 and 
BF3 occurs because BF3 has a vacant orbital in i
