appears to proceed in two elementary reactions (or two elementary steps), each of which 
is bimolecular. First, two NO2 molecules collide, and an oxygen atom is transferred from 
one to the other. The resultant NO3 then collides with a CO molecule and transfers an 
oxygen atom to it:
NO21g2 + NO21g2 ¡ NO31g2 + NO1g2
NO31g2 + CO1g2 ¡ NO21g2 + CO21g2

Thus, we say that the reaction occurs by a two-step mechanism.
The chemical equations for the elementary reactions in a  
multistep mechanism must always add to give the chemical  
equation of the overall process.
In the present example, the sum of the two elementary reactions is
 
2 NO21g2 + NO31g2 + CO1g2 ¡ NO21g2 + NO31g2 + NO1g2 + CO21g2 
Simplifying this equation by eliminating substances that appear on both 
sides gives Equation 14.25, the net equation for the process.
Because NO3 is neither a reactant nor a product of the reaction—it is 
formed in one elementary reaction and consumed in the
