orm water 
vapor at room temperature; (e) the dissolution of HCl(g) in 
water to form concentrated hydrochloric acid?
 19.13  Indicate whether each statement is true or false. (a) A reac-
tion that is spontaneous in one direction will be nonspon-
taneous in the reverse direction under the same reaction 
conditions. (b) All spontaneous processes are fast. (c) Most 
spontaneous processes are reversible. (d) An isothermal 
process is one in which the system loses no heat. (e) The 
maximum amount of work can be accomplished by an irre-
versible process rather than a reversible one.
 19.14  (a) Can endothermic chemical reactions be spontaneous? 
(b) Can a process be spontaneous at one temperature and 
nonspontaneous at a different temperature? (c) Water can 
be decomposed to form hydrogen and oxygen, and the 
hydrogen and oxygen can be recombined to form water.
Does this mean that the processes are thermodynamically 
reversible? (d) Does the amount of work that a system can 
do on its surro
