s up in an unfavorable
environment. As a result, the animal remains longer in favorable environments.
When a log or rock is lifted, animals will suddenly scurry about. These movements are kineses in response to light,
touch, air temperature, or other stimuli recognized as unfavorable.
2. Taxis (plural, taxes) is a directed movement in response to a stimulus. Movement is directed either toward or
away from the stimulus. Movement in response to light is called phototaxis. Movement in response to chemicals is
called chemotaxis.
Bacteria move toward oxygen or nutrients (positive chemotaxis) or away from toxic substances (negative
chemotaxis). Quorum sensing occurs when bacteria of the same species move toward each other to form colonies.
They move in response to a concentration gradient of signaling molecules emitted by bacteria of the same species
(positive chemotaxis). The grouping of bacteria into colonies creates biofilms that allow the bacteria to collectively
adhere more strongly to
