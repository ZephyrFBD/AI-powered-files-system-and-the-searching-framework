d, on both visits, the same group exercised or rested.)
After the visit to the gym, both groups were given a sports drink that
contained radioactive glucose. After allowing enough time for the
radioactive glucose to be absorbed by the brain, the subjects were
given a PET scan, which detects radioactivity in the brain. While
inside the PET scan machine, names were flashed in front of the
subject’s eyes. Some of the names were the names of celebrities;
others were not. For 30 minutes, the subjects were asked to press
one key on a screen when they recognized a celebrity’s name and a
different key when the name was unfamiliar. During this memory
task, the scientists tracked the subjects’ brain activity of the portions
of the brain that are involved in memory. The results of this
experiment are shown in the following table:
