gineer and co-workers (Nature, 513, 2014) discovered a
mutant Arabidopsis in which stomatal density increases as
CO2 concentration increases. Measurements of a
component of the set of mRNA molecules for epidermal
patterning factor 2 (EPF2), responsible for stomatal
density, are shown for plants grown in low and high CO2
concentrations.

A. Analyze these data in terms of the likelihood that the
effect of carbon dioxide concentration on stomatal density
involves negative feedback at the level of i) translation, ii)
post-transcription, or iii) changes in genotype.
B. Changes in precipitation patterns are expected to
accompany an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Predict the effect on a forest where trees that have
matured over decades are suddenly under drought stress.
Justify your prediction in terms of positive or negative
feedback where stomatal density is high and a drought
occurs.
In a favorable environment, trees continue
