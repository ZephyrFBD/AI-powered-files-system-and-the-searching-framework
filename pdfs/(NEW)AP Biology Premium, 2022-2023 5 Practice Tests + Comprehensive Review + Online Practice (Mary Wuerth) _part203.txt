nd the correct location of the light-independent reactions is the stroma. Choices (B) and (C) are
incorrect because the matrix is part of mitochondria, not chloroplasts, and is not involved in photosynthesis.
8. (B) If the thylakoid membrane is punctured, it would not be possible to generate a proton gradient since the
protons would be able to diffuse freely across the thylakoid membrane. Choices (A) and (D) occur during the
Calvin cycle, so (A) and (D) would not be directly affected by the puncturing of the thylakoid membrane. The
absorption of light by pigments would not be affected by the puncturing of the thylakoid membrane, so choice
(C) is also incorrect.
9. (B) The light-dependent reactions supply ATP to the Calvin cycle, which then returns ADP back to the light-
dependent reactions. Choice (A) is incorrect because the oxygen produced by the light-dependent reactions is
released to the atmosphere and the Calvin cycle consumes, not produces, carbon dioxide. Choice (C) is incorrec
