sis occurs, water leaves the vacuoles, the vacuoles
collapse, cell turgor drops, and the plasma membrane shrinks and pulls away from the cell wall.
46. C. Chlorophylls a and b have absorption peaks in the long wavelength area (between 650 and 750 nm). Of the
two, chlorophyll a has the greatest absorption at the longest wavelength of light.
47. A. The action spectrum is a plot of photosynthetic rate against light wavelengths absorbed. The highest rate of
photosynthetic activity occurs at about 450 nm.
48. C. Light that is not absorbed is reflected. The wavelengths of light that are not absorbed in photosynthesis occur
mostly in the 525 to 575 nm region. This can be seen most clearly by examining the plot for photosynthetic rate. Not
coincidentally, the color of light in the 525 to 575 nm region is green, the color we see when we look at a leaf.
49. C. The reaction NAD+ + H+ + 2e− → NADH occurs in glycolysis as
 
energy from pyruvate is used to attach the electrons and protons to
 
NAD+.
