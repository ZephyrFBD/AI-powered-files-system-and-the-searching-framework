 pigments in photosynthesis. Chlorophylls are found in photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII).
A photosystem is composed of proteins, chlorophyll, and other light-absorbing pigments called accessory pigments.
PSI and PSII contain different types of chlorophyll that absorb the most light energy at slightly different
wavelengths (700 nm and 680 nm, respectively). Photosystems are located in the thylakoid membrane of the
chloroplast and are connected by an electron transport chain (ETC). See Figure 8.2.
Figure 8.2 PSI, PSII, and the ETC
The energy in the photons is used to boost electrons in chlorophyll to a higher energy level in PSII. These
electrons from PSII are passed from one protein carrier to another in a series of redox (reduction-oxidation)
reactions that are analogous to “falling down a hill.” The final electron donor in the electron transport chain passes
the electron to PSI. As the electrons pass through the carrier molecules of the ETC, the energy that is released is
used to c
