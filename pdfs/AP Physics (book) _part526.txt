FIGURE 5;31 Looking down on the plane of Earth’s orbit
around the Sun (not to scale), above Earth’s north pole, showing
our Moon making one revolution about Earth: (a) at a Full moon
(the red dot is an observer at about 6 PM who can just see the Full
moon rise); (b) exactly one day later (for the red dot to see the 
Moon rise, the Earth must rotate another 50 min); (c) after making a
“half revolution” the Moon is in line with the Sun, on the Sun’s side,
and is a New moon; (d) after the Moon makes one complete revolution
around Earth (sidereal period); (e) at the next Full moon (synodic 
period). At (a) and (e) there could be a lunar eclipse (Earth’s shadow 
falling on the Moon) but this rarely happens because the plane of Moon’s 
orbit is inclined to the plane of Earth’s orbit, so the Moon is usually above or
below the Earth’s orbital plane. At (c) there could be a solar eclipse, also rare.
