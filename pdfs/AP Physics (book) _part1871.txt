Derivation of Capacitance for Parallel-Plate Capacitor
Equation 17–8 can be derived using the result from Section 16–12 on Gauss’s
law, namely that the electric field between two parallel plates is given by Eq.16–10:
We combine this with Eq. 17–4a, using magnitudes,
to obtain
Then, from Eq. 17–7, the definition of capacitance,
which is Eq. 17–8.
17–8 Dielectrics
In most capacitors there is an insulating sheet of material, such as paper or plastic,
called a dielectric between the plates (Fig. 17–18). This serves several purposes.
First, dielectrics break down (allowing electric charg
