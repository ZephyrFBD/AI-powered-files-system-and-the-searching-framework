position of water around deep-
sea vents is the same as it was on early Earth.
56. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey conducted
experiments which demonstrated that several organic
compounds could be formed spontaneously by simulating
the conditions of Earth's early atmosphere. When Miller
and Urey repeated their experiment without the electrical
discharge, no organic compounds were found. Hypothesize
what might explain this result. Consider your answer in the
context of the conditions of early Earth.
a.
The lack of organic compounds without the
sparks indicates that organic components are
formed from biotic components.
b.
The first trial of the experiment must have been
done incorrectly.
c.
Abiotic molecules can only develop into organic
molecules in the presence of oxygen, so oxygen
should be added.
d.
Lightning, or some form of energy, is needed for
the inorganic molecules in the atmosphere to
interact with each other. This indicates that a
similar energy source was present on early Eart
