Earth and
in the heavens. Furthermore, it formed the basis for successful treatments of
fluids, wave motion, and sound. Kinetic theory explained the behavior of gases
and other materials. Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism embodied all of electric
and magnetic phenomena, and it predicted the existence of electromagnetic
waves that would behave just like light—so light came to be thought of as an
electromagnetic wave. Indeed, it seemed that the natural world, as seen through
the eyes of physicists, was very well explained. A few puzzles remained, but it
was felt that these would soon be explained using already known principles.
