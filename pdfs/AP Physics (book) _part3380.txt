(c) After 
the magnitude of the activity will be (Eq. 30–5)
(d) We want to determine the time when 
From Eq. 30–5, we have
We take the natural log (ln) of both sides
and divide by to find
Easy Alternate Solution to (c)
is 6 half-lives, so the
activity will decrease to 
of its original value, or
per second.
30–10 Decay Series
It is often the case that one radioactive isotope decays to another isotope that is
also radioactive. Sometimes this daughter decays to yet a third isotope which also
is radioactive. Such successive decays are said to form a decay series. An important
example is illustrated in Fig. 30–11. As can be s
