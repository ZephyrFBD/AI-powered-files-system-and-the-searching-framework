rapid production of many
offspring.
c.
It increases genetic diversity, allowing
organisms to survive in an unpredictable
environment.
d.
It requires less energy and leads to genetic
variation in the offspring.
45. Sex determination in humans and other mammals is
dictated by the presence of sex chromosomes. Are there
different factors that determine the sex of other types of
animals?
a.
No, the sex of an individual is only determined
by the presence of sex chromosomes.
b.
Yes, temperature also determines the sex of an
individual.
c.
Yes, humidity and temperature determine the sex
of an individual.
d.
Yes, pH and humidity determine the sex of an
individual.
46. What are some advantages of internal compared with
external fertilization?
a.
Internal fertilization leads to more genetic
variations and increases the survival rates of
offsprings.
b.
Internal fertilization increases the survival rates
of offspring, and large numbers of offspring are
produced.
c.
Internal fertilization increases
