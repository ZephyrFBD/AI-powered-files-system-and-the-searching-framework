A light bulb is connected to a battery-powered electrical circuit that con-
tains two electrodes submerged in a beaker of each solution. In order for the light bulb 
to turn on, there must be an electrical current (that is, a flow of electrically charged par-
ticles) between the two electrodes immersed in the solution. Because the light bulb does 
not turn on in pure water, we conclude that there are not enough charged particles in 
pure water to create a circuit; water must then mostly exist as H2O molecules. The solu-
tion containing sucrose 1C12H22O112 also does not turn on the light bulb; therefore, we
