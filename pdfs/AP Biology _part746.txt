lood. Blood type AB is
known as the universal recipient because there are no antibodies to clump
the donor’s blood.
Rh Factor
Rh factor is another antigen located on the surface of red blood cells. Most
of the population—85 percent—have the antigen and are called Rh+.
Those without the antigen (15 percent) are Rh–.
AIDS
AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. People with AIDS
are highly susceptible to opportunistic diseases, infections, and cancers
that take advantage of a collapsed immune system. The virus that causes
AIDS, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), attacks cells that bear
CD4 molecules on their surface, mainly helper T cells. HIV is a retrovirus.
Once inside a cell, it reverse transcribes itself, using the enzyme reverse
transcriptase, and integrates the newly formed DNA into the host cell
genome. It remains in the nucleus as a provirus, directing the production of
new viruses.
