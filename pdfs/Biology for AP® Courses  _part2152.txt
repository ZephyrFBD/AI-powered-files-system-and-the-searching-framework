uddenly wiped out by an earthquake or hurricane, the
individuals that survive the event are usually a random sampling of the original group. As a result, the
genetic makeup of the population can change dramatically. This phenomenon is known as the bottleneck
effect.
Hypothesis: Repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each
time this experiment is run, the results will vary.
Test the hypothesis: Count out the original population using different colored beads. For example, red,
blue, and yellow beads might represent red, blue, and yellow individuals. After recording the number of
each individual in the original population, place them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a
few beads out at a time. Then, pour 1/3 of the bottleâ€™s contents into a bowl. This represents the surviving
individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. Count the number of the different colored
beads in the bowl, and record
