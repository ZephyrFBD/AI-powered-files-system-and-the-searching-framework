the body. (d) When the heart relaxes, the
semilunar valves close; blood fills the atria,
beginning the cycle again.

The heart of a human (and of other animals as well) is essentially a circulating
pump. The action of a human heart is shown in Fig. 10–41. There are actually 
two separate paths for blood flow. The longer path takes blood to the parts of 
the body, via the arteries, bringing oxygen to body tissues and picking up carbon
dioxide, which it carries back to the heart via veins. This blood is then pumped 
to the lungs (the second path), where the carbon dioxide is released and oxygen
is taken up. The oxygen-laden blood is returned to the heart, where it is again
pumped to the tissu
