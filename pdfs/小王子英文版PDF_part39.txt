"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I
will go on my way."
"No," said the king.
But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no

As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh,

"I made you my Ambassador,"the king called out, hastily.

"The grown­upsare very strange,"the little prince said to himself, as he continued on
his journey.
