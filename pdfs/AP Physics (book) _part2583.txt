was absent, the converging lens would form the image at its focal point—that is,
at a distance
behind it (dashed lines in Fig. 23–45). When the
diverging lens is placed next to the converging lens, we treat the image formed
by the first lens as the object for the second lens. Since this object lies to the
right of the diverging lens, this is a situation where 
is negative (see the sign
conventions, page 665). Thus, for the diverging lens, the object is virtual and
The diverging lens forms the image of this virtual object at a
distance
away (given). Thus,
We take the reciprocal to find
NOTE If this technique is to work, the converging lens must be “stronger” than
the diverging lens—that is, it must have a focal length whose magnitude is less
than that of the diverging lens.
