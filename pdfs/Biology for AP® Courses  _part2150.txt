s and mothers. The founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner
population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most
other populations. This is likely due to the fact that a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists carried
these mutations. As a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD) and Fanconi
anemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and congenital abnormalities.

effects.
Compare and contrast the bottleneck and founder effects.
a.
Both the bottleneck and founder effect are examples of gene flow. However, the bottleneck effect occurs
after a cataclysmic event, whereas the founder effect occurs when mutations introduce new alleles into a
population.
b.
Both the bottleneck and fou
