m. Using a color palette is a relative way to compare a change and is therefore 
qualitative. To collect quantitative data, a spectrophotometer or probe system is required.

A sample baseline palette is shown in Figure 2.  
Another suggestion is to make a maximally converted solution of tetraguaiacol and then  
prepare serial dilutions.  
1. Prepare a mixture equivalent to 10 replicate reactions containing the buffer, enzyme, 
and substrate. 
2. Incubate the mixture overnight so that all of the guaiacol converts to product. The 
concentration of guaiacol in the original mixture is known, so the concentration of 
brown product is simply that same concentration divided by 4 (tetraguaiacol). Make 
a series of dilutions (10% brown product, 20% brown product, etc.) and place them 
in test tubes. Students now have a color comparison chart that provides a spe
