y CO2 gas at a ratio of one molecule of CO2 for each 
molecule of O2. Thus, one would expect no change in gas volume to result from this 
experiment. However, the CO2 produced is removed by potassium hydroxide (KOH), 
which reacts with CO2 to form solid potassium carbonate (K CO
2
3) through the following 
reaction: 
CO2 + 2KOH → K2CO3 + H2O 
As O2 is consumed, the overall gas volume in the respirometer decreases, and this 
change can be used to determine the rate of cellular respiration. Because respirometers 
are sensitive to changes in gas volume, they are also sensitive to changes in temperature 
and air pressure; thus, students need to use a control respirometer containing nonliving 
matter (e.g., glass beads) instead of germinating seeds to measure and correct for 
changes in temperature and pressure. 
Once students learn how to measure the rate of cellular respiration, questions should 
emerge about the process that lead to investigation, including the following: 
•  What is the
