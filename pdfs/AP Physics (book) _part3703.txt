e sim-
ilar and have about the same intrinsic luminosity. Consequently, their apparent
brightness would be a measure of how far away they were.
Another technique makes use of the H–R diagram. Measurement of a star’s
surface temperature (from its spectrum) places it at a certain point (within 20%)
on the H–R diagram, assuming it is a main-sequence star, and then its luminosity
can be estimated from the vertical axis (Fig. 33–6). Its apparent brightness and
Eq. 33–1 give its approximate distance; see Example 33–5.
A better estimate comes from comparing variable stars, especially Cepheid
variables whose luminosity varies over time with a period that is found to be
related to their average luminosity. Thus, from their period and apparent bright-
ness we get their distance.
Distance via SNIa, Redshift
The largest distances are estimated by comparing the apparent brightnesses 
of Type Ia supernovae (“SNIa”). Type Ia supernovae all have a similar origin (as
described on the previous page and
