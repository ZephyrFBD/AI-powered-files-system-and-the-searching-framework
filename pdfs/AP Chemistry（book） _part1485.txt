ubstances usually have such a large HOMO–LUMO gap that 
visible light is not energetic enough to excite an electron to the 
higher level. The minimum energy needed to excite an electron from 
the HOMO to the LUMO in N2 corresponds to light with a wave-
length of less than 200 nm, which is far into the ultraviolet part of 
the spectrum. 
 (Figure 6.4) As a result, N2 cannot absorb visible 
light and is therefore colorless.
The magnitude of the energy gap between filled and empty 
electronic states is critical for solar energy conversion. Ideally, we 
want a substance that absorbs as many solar photons as possible 
and then converts the energy of those photons into a useful form 
of energy. Titanium dioxide is a readily available material that can 
be reasonably efficient at converting light directly into electricity. 
However, TiO2 is white and absorbs only a small amount of the Sun’s
