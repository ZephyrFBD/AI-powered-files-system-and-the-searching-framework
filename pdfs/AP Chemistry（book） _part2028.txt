ges in enthalpy. For example, when 
NaCl dissolves in water, the process is slightly endothermic, ∆Hsoln = 3.9 kJ>mol. We can 
use Hess’s law to analyze how the solute–solute, solvent–solvent, and solute–solvent inter-
actions influence the enthalpy of solution. 
 (Section 5.6)
We can imagine the solution process as having three components, each with an 
associated enthalpy change: A cluster of n solute particles must separate from one 
another 1∆Hsolute2, a cluster of m solvent particles separate from one another 1∆Hsolvent2, 
and these solute and solvent particles mix 1∆Hmix2.

3. n solute +  m solvent ∆ solution  
   ∆Hmix
4. 1solute2n +  1solvent2m ∆ solution 
∆Hsoln = ∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent + ∆Hmix
As seen above, the overall enthalpy change, ∆Hsoln, is the sum of the three steps:
 
∆Hsoln = ∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent + ∆Hmix

Separation of the solute particles from one another always requires an input o
