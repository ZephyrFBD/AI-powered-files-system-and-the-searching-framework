rvival is essential for reproduction to
occur. Strength, speed, height, camouflage, and many other things can be helpful. Sometimes odd things can be
helpful as well. For example, a peacock’s tail has been selected for because females choose to mate with males that
have a large and beautiful tail. The tail doesn’t help them to survive because it actually makes it easier for predators
to catch them, but it is essential for the females to find them attractive. This is an example of sexual selection.
Let’s go back to our moth example. We ended up with different gene pools in the two populations (north vs. south).
Eventually, over long stretches of time, these two different populations might change so much that they could no
longer reproduce together. At that point, we would have two different species, and we could say, definitively, that
the moths had evolved. Evolution ocurred as a consequence of random mutation and the pressure put on the
population by an environmental change. Catastrop
