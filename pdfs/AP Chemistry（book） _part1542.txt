ses (see the “Closer 
Look” box on phases) in the plane of the paper. Two lobes 
should be pointing toward M. (d) Now draw the dxy orbital 
of M, with phases. Can you see how they will overlap with 
the p*
2p orbital of CO? (e) What kind of bond is being made 
with the orbitals between M and C, s or p ? (f) Predict what 
will happen to the strength of the CO bond in a metal–CO 
complex compared to CO alone.

Methyl isocyanate, CH3NCO, was made infamous in 1984 
when an accidental leakage of this compound from a stor-
age tank in Bhopal, India, resulted in the deaths of about 
3800 people and severe and lasting injury to many thou-
sands more. (a) Draw a Lewis structure for methyl isocy-
anate. (b) Draw a ball-and-stick model of the structure, 
including estimates of all the bond angles in the com-
pound. (c) Predict all the bond distances in the molecule. 
(d) Do you predict that the molecule will have a dipole 
 
moment? Explain.
