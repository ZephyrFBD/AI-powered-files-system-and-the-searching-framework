orce we feel
on our feet, and (c) any
other aspects of gravity
you can think of.
19. The source of the Mississippi River is closer to the center
of the Earth than is its outlet in Louisiana (because the Earth
is fatter at the equator than at the poles). Explain how the
Mississippi can flow “uphill.”
20. People sometimes ask, “What keeps a satellite up in its orbit
around the Earth?” How would you respond?
21. Is the centripetal acceleration of Mars in its orbit around
the Sun larger or smaller than the centripetal acceleration
of the Earth? Explain.
22. The mass of the “planet” Pluto was not known until it was
discovered to have a moon. Explain how this enabled an
estimate of Pluto’s mass.
23. The Earth moves faster in its orbit around the Sun in Jan-
uary than in July. Is the Earth closer to the Sun in January,
or in July? Explain. [Note: This is not much of a factor in
producing the seasons—the main factor is the tilt of the
Earth’s axis relative to the plane of its orbit.]
