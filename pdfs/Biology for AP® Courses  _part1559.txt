istinguished by staining, reflecting different states
of packaging and compaction.
14.3 Basics of DNA Replication
The model for DNA replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each
strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. In conservative replication, the parental
DNA is conserved, and the daughter DNA is newly synthesized. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the
two parental DNA strands acts as template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA
includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. The dispersive mode suggested that the two copies of the
DNA would have segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA.
14.4 DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
Replication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome called the origin of replication—the point at
which the DNA opens up. Helicase opens up the DNA double helix, resulting
