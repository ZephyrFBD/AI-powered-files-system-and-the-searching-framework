walk depends on
friction between the soles of our shoes (or feet) and the ground. (Walking involves
static friction, not kinetic friction. Why?) The movement of a car, and also its 
stability, depend on friction. When friction is low, such as on ice, safe walking or
driving becomes difficult.

A box against a wall. You can hold a box
against a rough wall (Fig. 4–29) and prevent it from slipping down by pressing
hard horizontally. How does the application of a horizontal force keep an 
object from moving vertically?
RESPONSE This won’t work well if the wall is slippery. You need friction.
Even then, if you don’t press hard enough, the box will slip. The horizontal
force you apply produces a normal force on the box exerted by the wall (the 
net force horizontally is zero since the box doesn’t move horizontally). The force
of gravity
