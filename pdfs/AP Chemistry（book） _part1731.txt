the 
two substances. Differences in the magnitudes of the intermolecular forces are 
due to differences in the strengths of dipole–dipole attractions. The intermolecular 
forces get stronger as molecule polarity increases, with those molecules capable of 
hydrogen bonding having the strongest interactions.
2. When the molecules of two substances differ widely in molecular weights, 
and there is no hydrogen bonding, dispersion forces tend to determine 
which substance has the stronger intermolecular attractions. Intermolecu-
lar attractive forces are generally higher in the substance with higher molecular weight.
11.3 ∣ Select Properties of Liquids
The intermolecular attractions we have just discussed can help us understand many 
familiar properties of liquids. In this section, we examine three: viscosity, surface ten-
sion, and capillary action.
