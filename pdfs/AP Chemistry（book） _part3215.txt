▲ Figure 20.13 Relationships of E°, 횫G°, and K. Any one of these important parameters can 
be used to calculate the other two. The signs of E° and ∆G° determine the direction in which 
the reaction proceeds under standard conditions. The magnitude of K determines the relative 
amounts of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture.
(a) Use the standard reduction potentials in Table 20.1 to calculate the standard free-energy change, ∆G°, and the equilibrium 
constant, K, at 298 K for the reaction
4 Ag1s2 + O21g2 + 4 H+1aq2 ¡ 4 Ag+1aq2 + 2 H2O1l2
(b) Suppose the reaction in part (a) is written
2 Ag1s2 + 1
2 O21g2 + 2 H+1aq2 ¡ 2 Ag+1aq2 + H2O1l2
What are the values of E °, ∆G°, and K when the reaction is written in this way?
Solve
(a) We ﬁrst calculate E ° by breaking the equa-
tion into two half-reactions and obtaining
