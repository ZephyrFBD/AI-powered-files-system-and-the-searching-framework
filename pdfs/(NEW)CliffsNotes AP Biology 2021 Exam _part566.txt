mmals convert NH3 to urea in their livers. Urea is significantly less
 
toxic than NH3; thus, it requires less water to excrete in the urine.
3. Birds, insects, and many reptiles convert urea to uric acid. Since uric acid is mostly insoluble in water, it
precipitates and forms a solid. This allows considerable water conservation by permitting the excretion of nitrogen
waste as a solid. In birds, the precipitation also allows the nitrogen wastes to be securely isolated in a special sac in
the egg (the allantois), apart from the vulnerable developing embryo.
The Digestive System
Digestion is the chemical breakdown of food into smaller molecules. In an individual cell, digestion is accomplished
by intracellular digestion when a lysosome containing digestive enzymes merges with a food vacuole. In most
animals, however, the food ingested is too large to be engulfed by individual cells. Thus, food is first digested in a
gastrovascular cavity by extracellular digestion and then absorbed by in
