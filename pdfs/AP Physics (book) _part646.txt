useful work. An important characteristic of
all engines is their overall efficiency e, defined as the ratio of the useful power
output of the engine,
to the power input,
(provided by burning of gaso-
line, for example):
The efficiency is always less than 1.0 because no engine can create energy, and 
no engine can even transform energy from one form to another without some
energy going to friction, thermal energy, and other nonuseful forms of energy.
For example, an automobile engine converts chemical energy released in the burn-
ing of gasoline into mechanical energy that moves the pistons and eventually the
wheels. But nearly 85% of the input energy is “wasted” as thermal energy that
goes into the cooling system or out the exhaust pipe, plus friction in the moving
parts. Thus car engines are roughly only about 15% efficient. We will discuss 
efficiency in more detail in Chapter 15.
