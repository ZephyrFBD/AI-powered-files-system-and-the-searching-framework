In Practice Exercise 2 for Sample Exercise 16.1
1, we found that 
the percent ionization of niacin 1Ka = 1.5 * 10-52 in a 0.020 
M solution is 2.7%. Calculate the percentage of niacin mole-
cules ionized in a solution that is (a) 0.010 M, (b) 1.0 * 10-3 M.

CHAPTER 16 Acid–Base Equilibria
Give It Some Thought
What is the equilibrium associated with Ka3 for H3PO4?
The acid-dissociation constants for common polyprotic acids are listed in Table 16.3, 
and Appendix D provides a more complete list. The structure of citric acid illustrates the 
presence of multiple ionizable protons in Figure 16.13.
Notice in Table 16.3 that in most cases the Ka values for successive losses of protons 
differ by a factor of at least 103. Notice also that the value of Ka1 fo
