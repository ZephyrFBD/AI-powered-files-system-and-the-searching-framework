ring to 0.75 L. (b) Weigh out 2.62 g KBr, dissolve it in 122.38 g H2O 
to make exactly 125 g of 0.180 m solution. (c) Dissolve 244 g KBr in 
water, dilute with stirring to 1.85 L. (d) Weigh 10.1 g KBr, dissolve it 
in a small amount of water, and dilute to 0.568 L. 13.55 71% HNO3

13.63 The vapor pressure of both solutions is 17.5 torr. Because these 
 
two solutions are so dilute, they have essentially the same vapor pres-
sure. Generally, the less concentrated solution, the one with fewer moles 
of solute per kilogram of solvent, will have the higher vapor pressure.

soln = 238 torr (c) XEth in vapor = 0.472 13.69 (a) Because NaCl 
is a strong electrolyte, one mole of NaCl produces twice as many dis-
solved particles as one mole of the molecular solute C6H
