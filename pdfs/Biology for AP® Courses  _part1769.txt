Explain how the study of epigenetics can lead to improved treatment of cancer.
a.
Epigenetics would allow new body parts to be synthesized that could replace those damaged by cancer.
b.
Epigenetics could change the genetic code of all cells in the body to prevent them from becoming cancerous.
c.
New therapies could be made that changes the genetic code of harmful cancer genes.
d.
New therapies could be made that do not require altering the cancer cellâ€™s DNA.
