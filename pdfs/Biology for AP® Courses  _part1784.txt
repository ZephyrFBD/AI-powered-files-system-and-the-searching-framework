ature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA
molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with
the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene
expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.
RNA Splicing, the First Stage of Post-transcriptional Control
In eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The
regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (Figure 16.11). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but
prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.
Figure 16.11 Pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create different proteins.
