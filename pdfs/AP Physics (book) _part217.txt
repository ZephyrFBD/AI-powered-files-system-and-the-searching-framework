ght? (c) Why are there two answers to (b)?
47. (II) For an object falling freely from rest, show that the
distance traveled during each successive second increases
in the ratio of successive odd integers (1, 3, 5, etc.). (This
was first shown by Galileo.) See Figs. 2–19 and 2–22.
48. (II) A rocket rises vertically, from rest, with an accelera-
tion of 
until it runs out of fuel at an altitude of
775 m. After this point, its acceleration is that of gravity,
downward. (a) What is the velocity of the rocket when it
runs out of fuel? (b) How long does it take to reach this
point? (c) What maximum altitude does the rocket reach?
(d) How much time (total) does it take to reach
maximum altitude? (e) With what velocity does it strike
the Earth? (f) How long (total) is it in the air?
49. (II) A helicopter is ascending vertically with a speed of
At a height of 105 m above the Earth, a package
is dropped from the helicopter. How much time does it take
for the package to reach the ground? [Hint: W
