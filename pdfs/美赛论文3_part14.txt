nterface will also influence the value of
0
k . For example,
when bubbles are floating on the water, this will greatly hinder water vapor from
evaporation, radiation, convection and many other forms of heat conduction as well as
hinder the heat of the water from the conduction. At this time, the value of
0
k
will
decrease.

Brief explanation about precondition
From one essay, we know that the temperature of the most part of the room keeps
at about 12 C

in winter[3].It is common sense that the temperature will be higher in
summer. However, the best temperature of the water in the bathtub that fits people
well is 38 C

, so 

T


will be about 26 C

. Actually in most situations, 

T

will be less than or equal to 25 C

. Moreover, we can reason that the bathroom’s
condition won’t be too bad if there is a bathtub, so somehow the bathtub will have a
bath heater. Based on this, if the temperature of the room is much lower, we can use
the bath heater to ensure that the te
