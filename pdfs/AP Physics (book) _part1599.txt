system, and is a general statement of the conservation of energy. The
second law of thermodynamics expresses limits on the ability to do useful work,
and is often stated in terms of entropy, which is a measure of disorder. Besides
these two great laws, we also discuss some important related practical devices:
heat engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and air conditioners.

15–1 The First Law of Thermodynamics
In Section 14–2, we defined the internal energy of a system as the sum total of all
the energy of the molecules within the system. Then the internal energy of a
system should increase if work is done on the system, or if heat is added to it.
Similarly the internal energy should decrease if heat flows out of the system or if
work is done
