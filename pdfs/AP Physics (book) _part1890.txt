formation can be reduced so that less memory space is
required—fewer bits and bytes. For example, adjacent “pixels” on a photograph
that includes a blue sky may be essentially identical. If 200 almost identical pixels
can be coded as identical, that takes up less memory (or “size”) than to specify all
the 200 pixels individually. Compression schemes, like jpeg for photos, lose some
information and may be noticeable. In audio, MP3 players use one-tenth the space
that a CD does, but many listeners don’t notice. Compression is one reason that
more data or “information” can be transmitted digitally for a given bandwidth.
[Bandwidth is the fixed range of frequencies allotted to each radio or TV station
or Internet connection, and limits the number of bits transmitted per second.] 
In audio, many listeners claim that digital does not match analog in full sound
quality. And what about movies? Will digital ever match Technicolor?

Digital information transmission has another advantage: an
