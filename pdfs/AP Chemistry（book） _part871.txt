2 ¡ C1g2 + 4 H1g2
 
 (a) Compare this process with the reverse of the reaction 
that represents the standard enthalpy of formation of 
CH41g2. (b) Calculate the enthalpy change in each case. 
Which is the more endothermic process? What accounts 
for the difference in ∆H° values? (c) Suppose that 3.45 g 
CH41g2 reacts with 1.22 g F21g2, forming CF41g2 and HF(g) 
as sole products. What is the limiting reagent in this re-
action? If the reaction occurs at constant pressure, what 
amount of heat is evolved?
 5.127 One of the best-selling light, or low-calorie, beers is 4.2% 
alcohol by volume and a 12-oz serving contains 110 Cal-
ories; remember: 1 Calorie = 1000 cal = 1 kcal. To es-
timate the percentage of Calories that comes from the 
alcohol, consider the following questions. (a) Write a 
balanced chemical equation for the reaction of etha-
nol, C2H5OH, with oxygen to make carbon dioxide and 
water. (b) Use enthalpies of formation in Appendix C 
to determine ∆H for this reaction. (c) I
