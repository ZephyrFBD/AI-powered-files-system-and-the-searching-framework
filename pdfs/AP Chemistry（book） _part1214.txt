 the initial burning? (d) Magnesium nitride can 
also be formed by reaction of the metal with ammonia at high 
temperature. Write a balanced equation for this reaction. If a 
6.3-g Mg ribbon reacts with 2.57 g NH31g2 and the reaction 
goes to completion, which component is the limiting reac-
tant? What mass of H21g2 is formed in the reaction? (e) The 
standard enthalpy of formation of solid magnesium nitride is 
-461.08 kJ>mol. Calculate the standard enthalpy change for 
the reaction between magnesium metal and ammonia gas.
 7.114  (a) The measured Bi¬Br bond length in bismuth tribromide, 
BiBr3, is 2.63 Å. Based on this value and the data in Figure 7.8, 
predict the atomic radius of Bi. (b) Bismuth tribromide is solu-
ble in acidic solution. It is formed by treating solid bismuth(III) 
oxide with aqueous hydrobromic acid. Write a balanced chem-
ical equation for this reaction. (c) While bismuth(III) oxide 
is soluble in acidic solutions, it is insoluble in basic solutions 
such as NaO
