Activity
Carbon forms the backbone of important biological molecules. Create a mini-poster of a simple food chain
that shows how carbon enters and exits each organism on the chain. Based on the food chain you created,
make a prediction regarding the impact of human activity on the supply of carbon in the food chain.
