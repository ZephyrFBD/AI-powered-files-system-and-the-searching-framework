Trying to maintaining the best temperature as long as possible, which is also the
initial temperature, aims to let people have the most comfort. Once the temperature is
away from the best temperature, which is also the initial temperature, people will feel
less comfortable or even bad. For this, we use ‘Suffering degree’ to describe the level
people feel uncomfortable with the temperature of the water in the bathtub. There is
one thing we have to mention is that ‘suffering degree’ does not mean that the user
feels uncomfortable and bad. Once the user’s feeling is away from the best comfort,
the ‘suffering degree’ will be positive instead of zero.
From Weber-Fechner law, we know that the feeling intensity is proportional to
the common logarithm of stimulus intensity. Hence, we use the common logarithm of
temperature difference to evaluate the ‘suffering degree’. We will use D to represent
the ‘suffering degree’.
