41. What is the total energy of a proton whose kinetic energy
is 15 GeV? What is its wavelength?
42. The mean lifetimes listed in Table 32–2 are in terms of
proper time, measured in a reference frame where the par-
ticle is at rest. If a tau lepton is created with a kinetic energy
of 950 MeV, how long would its track be as measured in
the lab, on average, ignoring any collisions?
43. (a) How much energy is released when an electron and a
positron annihilate each other? (b) How much energy is
released when a proton and an antiproton annihilate each
other? (All particles have

44. If 
protons moving at

4.0 TeV,
are stored in the 4.3-km-radius ring of the LHC, (a) how
much current (amperes) is carried by this beam? (b) How
fast would a 1500-kg car have to move to carry the same
kinetic energy
