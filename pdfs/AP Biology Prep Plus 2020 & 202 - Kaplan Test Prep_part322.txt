(D)
Blocking signal transduction pathways can be extremely harmful and
even fatal. For example, cancer results when genetic and epigenetic
changes adversely impact important cellular processes, such as by
causing excessive cell division or by causing blood vessels to be attracted
to growing tumors. These processes are usually regulated by growth
factors, which are a type of hormone. As a result, many of the mutations
that lead to cancer development can be found within signal transduction
pathways.
6. Which of the following provides a possible explanation for what is
occurring in the image as soon as the hormone binds to the
receptor?
The ligand causes the membrane protein to change shape,
allowing a specific extracellular molecule to enter.
(A)
The hormone causes an intracellular cascade, thereby
amplifying the original signal.
(B)
The ligand targets the expression of a specific gene, causing
its transcription to stop temporarily.
(C)
The hormone causes the membrane protein to
