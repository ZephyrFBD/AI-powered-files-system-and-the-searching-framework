sider the effects of expansion of human populations on local plant and 
animal communities, respectively. Students were asked to predict a likely ecological consequence to a 
plant community during the site preparation and construction of a sports complex in a formerly wooded 
area. Students were then asked to predict a likely effect on the animal community that might result from 
regular use and maintenance of the playing fields. Finally, students were asked to use appropriate data to 
support the effects of the expansion of human populations. 
How well did students perform on this question? 
The mean score for this question was 3.34 out of a possible 4 points. 
What were common student errors or omissions?  
Overall, students demonstrated a strong understanding of ecological consequences of human expansion. 
Common errors included statements indicating that organisms in a specific area would either go extinct or 
undergo speciation. Students attempted to connect the removal of plants
