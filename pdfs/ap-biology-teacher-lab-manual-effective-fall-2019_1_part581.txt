 a voltage that is too high, there 
will likely be less separation of the DNA fragments. Since students are likely to leave 
the lab to attend another class(es), you should plan on supervising the progress of the 
electrophoresis, stain the gels (15–30 minutes), and then destain them (45 minutes to 
overnight). Another suggestion is to have students come back to the lab at the end of 
school to stain and destain their gels.

Lab Day 2 
Allow approximately 45 to 60 minutes for students to analyze, process, and discuss their 
results. It is recommended that you ask students to write conclusions to the scenario to 
reveal “whodunit” based on motive, means, opportunity, and, of course, DNA evidence. 
This project can be assigned for homework, but students will enjoy sharing their stories. 
■ Safety and Housekeeping 
Instruct students that they should never handle gels with their bare hands. An 
electrophoresis apparatus can be dangerous
