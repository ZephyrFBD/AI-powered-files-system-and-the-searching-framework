red crystalline regions, 
making the polymer denser, harder, less soluble, and more resistant to heat. Table 12.7 
shows how the properties of polyethylene change as the degree of crystallinity increases.
The linear structure of polyethylene is conducive to intermolecular interactions that 
lead to crystallinity. However, the degree of crystallinity in polyethylene strongly depends 
on the average molecular weight. Polymerization results in a mixture of macromolecules 
with varying values of n (numbers of monomer molecules) and, hence, varying molecular 
weights. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), used in forming films and sheets, has an aver-
age molecular weight in the range of 104 amu, has a density of less than 0.94 g>cm3, and has 
substantial chain branching. That is, there are side chains off the main chain of the poly-
mer. These side chains inhibit the formation of crystalline regions, reducing the density of 
the material. High-density polyethylene (HDPE), used to form bottles,
