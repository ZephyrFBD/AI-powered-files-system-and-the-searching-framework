Archimedes is said to have discovered his principle in his bath while thinking
how he might determine whether the king’s new crown was pure gold or a fake.
Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3, somewhat higher than that of most metals, but
a determination of specific gravity or density is not readily done directly because,
even if the mass is known, the volume of an irregularly shaped object is not easily
calculated. However, if the object is weighed in air 
and also “weighed”
while it is under
