een 9:3:3:1. Choice D cannot be correct because it doesn’t account
for the odd results of the 8 and 9 offspring. (IST-1)
(A) For the autosomal gene: P = pink pigments; p = yellow pigments.
For the sex-linked gene (on the X-chromosome): C, which allows
for colored pigments, is dominant and = XC; c, which prevents
colored pigments regardless of the presence of P or p, = Xc. In
choice A (Pp XcXc × Pp XCY), the female lacks the sex-linked gene
for the deposition of pigment. Therefore, she has white eyes. The
male has dominant C, so he has pigmented eyes. Since he has at
least one dominant P, he has pink eyes. That satisfies what is asked
in the question. (IST-1)
(D) Autosomes are the chromosomes other than sex chromosomes
(X and Y). An adult female has 44 autosomes plus two sex
chromosomes (XX). (IST-1)
(C) No matter how many children a couple has, the chance that the
child will be a boy or a girl is always 12. Although it is true that
