properties describe the way a substance may change, or react, to form other substances. 
A common chemical property is flammability, the ability of a substance to burn in the 
presence of oxygen.
Some properties, such as temperature and melting point, are intensive properties. 
Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of sample being examined and are 
particularly useful in chemistry because many intensive properties can be used to identify 
substances. Extensive properties depend on the amount of sample, with two examples 
being mass and volume. Extensive properties relate to the amount of substance present.
Give It Some Thought
When we say that lead is a denser metal than aluminum, are we talking about an 
extensive or intensive property?
Physical and Chemical Changes
The changes substances undergo are either physical or chemical. During a physical 
change, a substance changes its physical appearance but not its composition. (That 
is, it is the same substan
