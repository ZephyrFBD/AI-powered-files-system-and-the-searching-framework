The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells is more complicated than in prokaryotes. There are several
reasons for this:
 
1. Multicellularity. Many eukaryotic organisms are multicellular. This requires different gene regulation programs
for different cell types.
2. Chromosome complexity. The chromosomes of eukaryotic organisms are more complex than those of
prokaryotes due to their much larger size and elaborate organization with histone proteins. Also, some metabolic
processes require the activation of multiple genes, each of which are located on a different chromosome. In these
cases, coordinated expression of these genes requires a more sophisticated system of regulation than that which is
present in prokaryotes.
3. Uncoupling of transcription and translation. In prokaryotes, translation begins while transcription is still in
progress. In contrast, eukaryotic transcription occurs in the nu
