20. (II) Calculate the current through each resistor in Fig.19–50
if each resistance 
and 
What is
the potential difference between points A and B?
21. (III) Two resistors when connected in series to a 120-V line
use one-fourth the power that is used when they are con-
nected in parallel. If one resistor is 
what is the
resistance of the other?
22. (III) Three equal resistors (R) are connected to a battery
as shown in Fig. 19–51. Qualitatively, what happens to
(a) the voltage drop across each of these resistors, (b) the
current flow through each, and (c) the terminal voltage of
the battery, when the switch S is opened, after having been
closed for a long time? (d) If the emf of the battery is 9.0 V,
what is its terminal voltage when the switch is closed if the
internal resistance r is 
and
(e) What is
the terminal voltage
when the switch is
open?
