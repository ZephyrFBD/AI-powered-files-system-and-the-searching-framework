enzyme, a
kinase, transfers a phosphate from a substrate directly to ADP.
Only a small amount of ATP is produced this way. This is the way
energy is produced during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. (See
Figure 6.1.)
Oxidative phosphorylation depends on chemiosmosis. This is the
way 90 percent of all ATP is produced from cell respiration. During
oxidative phosphorylation, NAD and FAD lose protons (become
oxidized) to the electron transport chain, which pumps them to the
outer compartment of the mitochondrion, creating a steep proton

gradient. This electrochemical or proton gradient powers the
phosphorylation of ADP into ATP during chemiosmosis.
During respiration, most energy flows in this sequence:
Glucose → NADre and FADre → electron transport chain →
chemiosmosis → ATP
Theoretically, about 36–38 ATP can be released from the aerobic
respiration of 1 molecule of glucose. This is hypothetical because some
cells are more efficient than others a
