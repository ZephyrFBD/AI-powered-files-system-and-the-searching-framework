O91l2 to moles and using the fact that 
the decomposition of 1 mol of C3H5N3O91l2 yields 1541.4 kJ we have:
 10.60 * 10-3 g C3H5N3O92a

(d) Because trinitroglycerin melts below room temperature, we 
expect that it is a molecular compound. With few exceptions, 
ionic substances are generally hard, crystalline materials that melt 
at high temperatures. 
(Sections 2.6  and 2.7) Also, the molec-
ular formula suggests that it is a molecular substance because all of 
its constituent elements are nonmetals.
(e) The energy stored in trinitroglycerin is chemical potential 
energy. When the substance reacts explosively, it forms carbon 
dioxide, water, and nitrogen gas, which are of lower potential 
energy. In the course of the chemical transformation, energy is 
released in the form of heat; the gaseous reaction products are 
very hot. This high heat energy is transferr
