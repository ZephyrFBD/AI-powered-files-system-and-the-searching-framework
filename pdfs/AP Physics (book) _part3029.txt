 this equation, E refers to the energy of a
particle; and on the other side of the equation, we have the frequency f of the
corresponding wave.
27–8 Wave Nature of Matter
In 1923, Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) extended the idea of the wave–particle
duality. He appreciated the symmetry in nature, and argued that if light some-
times behaves like a wave and sometimes like a particle, then perhaps those things
in nature thought to be particles—such as electrons and other material objects—
might also have wave properties. De Broglie proposed that the wavelength of a
material particle would be related to its momentum in the same way as for a photon,
Eq. 27–6,
That is, for a particle having linear momentum 
the wavelength is given by
(27;8)
and is valid classically (
for 
) and relativistically
This is sometimes called the de Broglie wavelength of a 
particle.
