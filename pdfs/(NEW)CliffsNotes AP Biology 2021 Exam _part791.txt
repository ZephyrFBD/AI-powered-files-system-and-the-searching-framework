by ampicillin treatment. Only those bacteria that have the pAMP plasmid survive the ampicillin treatment. In
addition, you may use plasmids that also have a colored-marker gene, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), that
allows you to observe the growth of transformed cells.
Many bacteria take up extracellular DNA readily and thus transform naturally. Others can be induced to absorb
DNA only under specific laboratory conditions. In either case, cells that are able to absorb DNA are designated
competent cells.
Part I: Transferring a Plasmid into a Bacterium
In the first part of this lab, the bacterial plasmid, pAMP, is transferred to E. coli bacteria. The following steps
summarize the procedure:
 
1. Add CaCl2 to two tubes. CaCl2 induces competence in the bacteria.
 
2. Add E. coli bacteria to both tubes. One tube will be transformed with pAMP plasmids. The second will be a
control.
 
3. Transfer pAMP plasmids to one of the test tubes.
 
4. Facilitate the absorption of DNA (transf
