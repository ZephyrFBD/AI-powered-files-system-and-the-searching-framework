Distinguish between
power and energy
†The unit was chosen by James Watt (1736–1819), who needed a way to specify the power of his
newly developed steam engines. He found by experiment that a good horse can work all day at an
average rate of about 
So as not to be accused of exaggeration in the sale of his steam
engines, he multiplied this by 
when he defined the hp.

Power needs of a car
FIGURE 6–28 Example 6–13.
Stair-climbing power. A 60-kg jogger runs up a long 
flight of stairs in 4.0 s (Fig. 6–28). The vertical height of the stairs is 4.5 m.
(a) Estimate the jogger’s power output in watts and horsepower. (b) How 
much energy did this require?
APPROACH The work done by the jogger is against gravity, and equals
To get her average power output, we divide W by the time it took.
SOLUTION (a) The average power output was
Since there are 746 W in 1 hp, the jogger is doing work at
