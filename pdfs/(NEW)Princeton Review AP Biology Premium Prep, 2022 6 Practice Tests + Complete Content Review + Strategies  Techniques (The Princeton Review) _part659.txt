ected into the wild-type Neurospora cells instead of the mitochondria, explain
whether the resulting fungi would have the poky phenotype.
They should NOT have the poky phenotype.
d. Justify your prediction.
The resulting fungi should not have the poky phenotype because the trait is not carried on a nuclear genome. It is
part of the mitochondrial genome, and giving the nuclear genome is not going to provide the gene for the poky
phenotype.
Question 4
a. Finches are incapable of digging burrows yet approximately 25% of the finches found on the island live in
underground dwellings. Describe the source of the finch dwellings.
The source of the burrows must come from some other animal on the island. Small rodents could dig the burrows
which the finches live in opportunistically either simultaneously or after the rodents have abandoned the burrows.
b. Describe the relationship between the finches and rodents on the island.
The finches and the rodents have a symbiotic relationship. The rodent
