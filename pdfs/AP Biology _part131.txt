INTRODUCTION
here are two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is
responsible for growth and repair, produces two genetically
identical daughter cells referred to as clones, and preserves the diploid (2n)
chromosome number. Mitosis passes a complete genome from parent to
the offspring.

gametes. It results in cells that are haploid; they have half the
chromosome number of the parent cell (n).
Any discussion about cell division must first consider the structure of
the chromosome. A chromosome consists of a highly
