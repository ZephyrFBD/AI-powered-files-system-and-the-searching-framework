atalyzed by protein complexes called spliceosomes that are composed of proteins and RNA
molecules called snRNAs. Spliceosomes recognize sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the intron.
Errors in splicing are implicated in cancers and other human diseases. What kinds of mutations might lead to splicing
errors? Think of different possible outcomes if splicing errors occur.
a.
Mutations in the spliceosome recognition sequence at each end of an intron, or in the proteins and RNAs that
make up the spliceosome, may occur. Mutations may also add new spliceosome recognition sites.
b.
Mutations in the spliceosome recognition sequence at each end of an exon, or in the proteins and RNAs that
make up the spliceosome, may occur. Mutations may also add new spliceosome recognition sites.
c.
Mutations in the spliceosome recognition sequence at each end of an intron, or in the proteins and RNAs that
make up the spliceosome, may occur. Mutations may also delete existing spliceosome recognition sites.
d.
