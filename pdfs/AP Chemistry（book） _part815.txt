CALORIMETRY (SECTION 5.5) The amount of heat transferred 
between the system and the surroundings is measured experi-
mentally by calorimetry. A calorimeter measures the temperature 
change accompanying a process. The temperature change of a 
calorimeter depends on its heat capacity, the amount of heat re-
quired to raise its temperature by 1 K. The heat capacity for one 
mole of a pure substance is called its molar heat capacity; for one 
gram of the substance, we use the term specific heat. Water has 
a very high specific heat, 4.18 J>g@K. The amount of heat, q, ab-
sorbed by a substance is the product of its specific heat (Cs), its 
mass, and its temperature change: q = Cs * m * âˆ†T.
If a calorimetry experiment is carried out under a constant 
pressure, the heat transferred provides a direct measure of the en-
thalpy change of the reaction. Constant-volume calorimetry is 
carried out in a vessel o
