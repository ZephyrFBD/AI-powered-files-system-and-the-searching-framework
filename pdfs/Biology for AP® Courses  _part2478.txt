Role of Prokaryotes in Ecosystems
Prokaryotes are ubiquitous: There is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present. Prokaryotes play many roles in
the environments they occupy. The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on Earth.
Prokaryotes and the Carbon Cycle
Carbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (Figure
22.18). Carbon is cycled through Earthâ€™s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks,
and biomass. The movement of carbon is via carbon dioxide, which is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and
marine prokaryotes,
