 nuclear 
charge and number of electrons increase, consider Figure 7.5.  
Although 
the details of how the Zeff values in the graph were calculated are 
 
beyond the scope of our discussion, the trends are instructive.
The effective nuclear charge felt by the outermost electrons is 
smaller than that felt by inner electrons because of screening by the inner 
electrons. In addition, the effective nuclear charge felt by the outermost 
electrons does not increase as steeply with increasing atomic number be-
cause the valence electrons make a small but nonnegligible contribution 
to the screening constant S. The most striking feature  
associated with the 
Zeff value for the outermost electrons is the sharp drop between the last 
period 2 element (Ne) and the ﬁrst  
period 3 element (Na). This drop re-
ﬂects the fact that the core electrons are much more effective than the 
valence electrons at screening the  
nuclear charge.
