e often describe atoms as consisting of a 
nucleus surrounded by an electron cloud.
Orbitals and Quantum Numbers
The solution to Schrödinger’s equation for the hydrogen atom yields a set of wave 
functions called orbitals. Each orbital has a characteristic shape and energy. For 
 
example, the lowest-energy orbital in the hydrogen atom has the spherical shape 
illustrated in Figure 6.17 and an energy of -2.18 * 10 - 18 J. Note that an orbital 
(quantum-mechanical model, which describes electrons in terms of probabilities, 
visualized as “electron clouds”) is not the same as an orbit (the Bohr model, which 
visualizes the electron moving in a physical orbit, like a planet around a star). The 
quantum-mechanical model does not refer to orbits because the motion of the 
electron in an atom cannot be precisely determined (Heisenberg’s uncertainty 
principle).
The Bohr model introduced a single quantum number, n, to describe an orbit. The 
quantum-mechanical model uses three quantum numbers
