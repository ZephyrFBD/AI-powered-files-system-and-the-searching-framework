set
it into vibration, and these vibrations are transformed into an electrical signal
(Chapter 21) with the same frequencies, which can then be amplified and sent to
a loudspeaker or recorder.
Figure 12â€“5 is a diagram of the human ear. The ear consists of three main
divisions: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. In the outer ear, sound waves
from the outside travel down the ear canal to the eardrum (the tympanum), which
vibrates in response to the impinging waves. The middle ear consists of three small
bones known as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, which transfer the vibrations of
the eardrum to the inner ear at the oval window. This delicate system of levers,
coupled with the relatively large area of the eardrum compared to the area of 
the oval window, results in the pressure being amplified by a factor of about 20.
The inner ear consists of the semicircular canals, which are important for control-
ling balance, and the liquid-filled cochlea where the vibrational energy of soun
