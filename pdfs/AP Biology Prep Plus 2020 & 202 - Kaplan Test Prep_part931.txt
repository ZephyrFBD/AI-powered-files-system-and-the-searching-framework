nstrate how similar diï¬€erent organisms are to each
other, but they do not necessarily indicate ancestral relationships. (B)
is correct because the fungi and animal branches are closer together
than the fungi and plant branches. (A) is incorrect because
relationships of descent and ancestry cannot be inferred from a
cladogram. At best, it would be reasonable to conclude that fungi and
animals shared a common ancestor, but not that animals directly
come from fungi. (C) is incorrect because autotrophic protists and
heterotrophic protists occupy two separate branches with
considerable distance between them. (D) is incorrect not only because
it is factually inaccurate, but also because this kind of information
cannot be inferred from a cladogram.
3. D
Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate consisting of glucose monomers.
Because of its structure, it can be easily converted to or from glucose,
which allows it to serve as a quick, short-term energy source. (D) is
thus correct. (A) is incorrect be
