osing
stomatal pores during the night
b.
by using CAM photosynthesis and by opening of
stomatal pores during the night
c.
by using CAM photosynthesis and by keeping
stomatal pores closed at all times
d.
by bypassing CAM photosynthesis and by
keeping stomatal pores closed at night
32. Why are carnivores, such as lions, dependent on
photosynthesis to survive?
a.
because the prey of lions are generally
herbivores which depend on heterotrophs
b.
because the prey of lions are generally smaller
carnivorous animals which depend on non-
photosynthetic organisms
c.
because the prey of lions are generally
herbivores which depend on autotrophs
d.
because the prey of lions are generally
omnivores that depend only on autotrophs.
33. Why does it take three turns of the Calvin cycle to
produce G3P, the initial product of photosynthesis?
a.
To fix enough carbon to export one G3P
molecule.
b.
To fix enough oxygen to export one G3P
molecule.
c.
To produce RuBisCO as an end product.
d.
To produce ATP and
