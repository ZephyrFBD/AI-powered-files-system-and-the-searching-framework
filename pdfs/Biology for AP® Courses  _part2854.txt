ironment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the deviation
parameter toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. If the
blood’s glucose rises after a meal, adjustments are made to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues
that need it or to store it for later use.
Control of Homeostasis
When a change occurs in an animal’s environment, an adjustment must be made. The receptor senses the change in the
environment, then sends a signal to the control center (in most cases, the brain) which in turn generates a response that
is signaled to an effector. The effector is a muscle (that contracts or relaxes) or a gland that secretes. Homeostatsis is
