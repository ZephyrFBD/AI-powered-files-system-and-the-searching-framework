ecules (blue), and AB molecules. (a) Which reaction mix-
ture is at equilibrium? (b) For those mixtures that are not 
at equilibrium, how will the reaction proceed to reach 
equilibrium? [Sections 15.5 and 15.6]

15.9 The reaction A21g2 + B1g2 ∆ A1g2 + AB1g2 has an 
equilibrium constant of Kp = 2. The accompanying 
diagram shows a mixture containing A atoms (red), A2 
molecules, and AB molecules (red and blue). How many 
B atoms should be added to the diagram to illustrate an 
equilibrium mixture? [Section 15.6]
 15.10 The diagram shown here represents the equilibrium state 
for the reaction A21g2 + 2 B1g2 ∆ 2 AB1g2. (a) Assum-
ing the volume is 2 L, calculate the equilibrium constant 
Kc for the reaction. (b) If the volume of the equilibrium 
mixture is decreased, will the number of AB molecules 
increase or decrease? [Sections 15.5 and 15.7]
