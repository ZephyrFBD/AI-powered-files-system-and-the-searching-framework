is linked 
to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic 
phosphate via ATP synthase.
ENE-1.J.5
The energy captured in the light reactions 
and transferred to ATP and NADPH powers 
the production of carbohydrates from carbon 
dioxide in the Calvin cycle, which occurs in the 
stroma of the chloroplast.

EXCLUSION STATEMENT—Memorization of 
the steps in the Calvin cycle, the structure of the 
molecules, and the names of enzymes (with the 
exception of ATP synthase) are beyond the scope of 
the course and the AP Exam.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENE-1.J
