nships. It is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an
ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other. Organisms in two taxa may have
split apart at a specific branch point, but neither taxa gave rise to the other.

Figure 20.3 The root of a phylogenetic tree indicates that an ancestral lineage gave rise to all organisms on the tree.
A branch point indicates where two lineages diverged. A lineage that evolved early and remains unbranched is a basal
taxon. When two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are sister taxa. A branch with more than two lineages
is a polytomy.
The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. The pathway can be traced from the
origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by
starting with a single species and tracing back towards
