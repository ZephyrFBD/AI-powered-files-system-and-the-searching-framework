72. Spiderman uses his spider webs to save a runaway train
moving about 
Fig. 6–44. His web stretches a few
city blocks (500 m) before the 
train comes to a stop.
Assuming the web acts like a spring, estimate the effective
spring constant.

75. A mass m is attached to a spring which is held stretched a
distance x by a force F, Fig. 6–45, and then released.
The spring pulls the mass to the left, towards its natural
equilibrium length. Assuming there is no friction, determine
the speed of the mass m when the spring returns: (a) to its
normal length
(b) to half its original extension
(x2).

76. An elevator cable breaks when a 925-kg elevator is 28.5 m
above the top of a huge spring  
at the
bottom of the shaft. Calculate (a) the work done by gravity
on the elevator before it hits the spring; (b) the speed of the
elevator just before striking the spring; (c) the amount the
spring co
