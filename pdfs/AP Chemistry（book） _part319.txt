n, Ca2 +.
SOLUTION
We predict that Na2O and CaCl2 are ionic compounds because 
they are composed of a metal combined with a nonmetal. We 
predict (correctly) that N2O and SF4 are molecular compounds be-
cause they are composed entirely of nonmetals.

What is the empirical formula of the compound formed between W6+ and O2-?
The elements essential to life are highlighted in color in Figure 2.21. 
More than 97% of the mass of most organisms is made up of just six 
of these elements—oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and sulfur. Water is the most common compound in living organisms, 
 
accounting for at least 70% of the mass of most cells. In the solid com-
ponents of cells, carbon is the most prevalent element by mass. Car-
bon atoms are found in a vast variety of organic molecules, bonded 
either to other carbon atoms or to atom
