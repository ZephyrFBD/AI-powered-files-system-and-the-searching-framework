a second or more
(“time exposures”) to 
or faster. To avoid blurring from camera movement,
exposure times shorter than 
are normally needed. If the object is moving,
even shorter exposure times are needed to “stop” the action (
or less).
If the exposure time is not fast enough, the image will be blurred by camera
shake. Blurring in low light conditions is more of a problem with cell-phone 
cameras whose inexpensive sensors need to have the shutter open longer to 
collect enough light. Digital still cameras or cell phones that take short videos
must have a fast enough “sampling” time and fast “clearing” (of the charge) so 
as to take pictures at least 15 frames per second; preferable is 24 fps (like film) 
or 30, 60, or 120 fps like TV refresh rates (25, 50, or 100 in areas like Europe
where 50 Hz is the normal line voltage frequency).
f-stop The amount of light reaching the sensor or film depends on the area of
the lens opening as well as shutter speed, and must be carefully controlled
