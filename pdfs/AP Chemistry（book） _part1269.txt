later in the book. Nonetheless, the ability to quickly categorize the pre-
dominant bonding interactions in a substance as covalent or ionic imparts considerable 
insight into the properties of that substance. The question then becomes the best way to 
recognize which type of bonding dominates.
The simplest approach is to assume that the interaction between a metal and a non-
metal is ionic and that between two nonmetals is covalent. While this classification 
scheme is reasonably predictive, there are far too many exceptions to use it blindly. For 
example, tin is a metal and chlorine is a nonmetal, but SnCl4 is a molecular substance that 
exists as a colorless liquid at room temperature. It freezes at -33 °C and boils at 114 °C.  
The characteristics of SnCl4 are not those typical of an ionic substance. Is there a more 
predictable way of determining what type of bonding is prevalent in a compound? A 
more sophisticated approach is to use the difference in electronegativity as the ma
