leotides in the 5' direction.
(B)
This option is incorrect. The figure incorrectly shows Okazaki fragments on the 
“leading” strand and both new strands being assembled in a parallel direction. 
DNA polymerase’s structure does not allow it to add nucleotides in the 5' 
direction.
(C)
This option is incorrect. The figure incorrectly shows both strands being 
replicated continuously, and no Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand are 
identified. The new strands are shown being assembled in the 3'-to-5' direction, 
but the limitations of DNA polymerase only allow assembly in the 5'-to-3' 
direction.
(D)
This option is correct. It demonstrates an understanding of the structure of 
DNA and the process of replication. The two strands of the DNA molecule 
run antiparallel to each other; the 5' end of one strand pairs with the 3' end of 
the other strand. Replication is semi-conservative, with each strand serving as 
the template for the creation of new complementary strands. Helicase unzips
