saccharides like lactose, making (A) incorrect.

If glucose levels are high, the Y operon would be expected to be repressed.
If the Y operon is no longer being transcribed, protein Y levels would fall,
eliminating (C). Based on the experimental results, protein Y seems to
inhibit X operon transcription. Therefore, protein X levels would increase
when protein Y levels decrease and no longer inhibit transcription of the X
operon, making (B) correct. There is no indication that glucose would
directly bind the X operon operator or increase transcription as described
in (A) and (D), respectively.
26. B
Proteins that are destined to be released from the cell, such as peptide
hormones, are synthesized by ribosomes bound to the rough
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The proteins are then moved to the Golgi
apparatus before they are shuttled in vesicles to the membrane for
release. Thus, (B) is correct. Smooth ER produces hormones, but these
steroid hormones take a diï¬€erent route for transport.
