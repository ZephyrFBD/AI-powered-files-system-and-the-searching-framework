Problem 80.
83. A capacitor is made from two 1.1-cm-diameter coins sepa-
rated by a 0.10-mm-thick piece of paper 
A 12-V
battery is connected to the capacitor. How much charge is
on each coin?
(K = 3.7).
89. If the electrons in a single raindrop, 3.5 mm in diameter, could
be removed from the Earth (without removing the atomic
nuclei), by how much would the potential of the Earth
increase?
90. Thunderclouds may develop a voltage difference of about
Given that an electric field of 
is
required to produce an electrical spark within a volume of
air, estimate the length of a thundercloud lightning bolt.
[Can you see why, when lightning strikes from a cloud to the
ground, the bolt has to propagate as a sequence of steps?]
91. A manufacturer claims that a carpet will not generate more
than 6.0 kV of static electricity. What magnitude of
