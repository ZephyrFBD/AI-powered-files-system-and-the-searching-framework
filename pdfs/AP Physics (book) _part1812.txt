 Particles of charge 
and 
are placed
in a line (Fig. 16–52). The center one is 0.35 m from each of
the others. Calculate the net force on each charge due to
the other two.

13. (II) A charge Q is transferred from an initially uncharged
plastic ball to an identical ball 24 cm away. The force of attrac-
tion is then 17 mN. How many electrons were transferred
from one ball to the other?
12. (II) Three positive particles of equal charge,
are
located at the corners of an equilateral triangle of side
15.0 cm (Fig. 16–53). Calculate
the magnitude and direction of
the net force on each particle
due to the other two.
