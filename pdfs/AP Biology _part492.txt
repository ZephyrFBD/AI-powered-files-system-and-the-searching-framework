examples of parallel evolution.
(EVO-3 & SP 1)
(C) Adaptive radiation is the emergence of numerous species from
one common ancestor introduced into a new environment. Today, 14
different species of finches are on the Galapagos Islands where
originally there was only 1 species. Each species fills a different
niche. (EVO-1)
(A) Genetic drift is evolution through chance. The founder effect is
one example of genetic drift. Another is the bottleneck effect. (EVO-
1)
(D) The classic example of convergent evolution can be seen in the
whale and the shark. The two animals are unrelated; the whale is a
mammal and the shark is a fish. However, they look alike because
they experience the same environmental pressures. They both have a
streamlined appearance with fins because that design is best for
living in the ocean, not because they are related or have a recent
common ancestor. (EVO-3)
(B) Eutherians (placental mammals) and marsupials are closely
related although they diverged several million ye
