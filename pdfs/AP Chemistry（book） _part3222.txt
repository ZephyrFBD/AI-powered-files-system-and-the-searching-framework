, is related to the standard free-energy change for the reaction, ∆G°:
 
∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q 
[20.15]
The quantity Q is the reaction quotient, which has the form of the equilibrium-constant 
expression except that the concentrations are those that exist in the reaction mixture at a 
given moment. 
 (Section 15.6)
Substituting ∆G = -nFE (Equation 20.11) into Equation 20.15 gives
 
-nFE = -nFE° + RT ln Q 
Solving this equation for E gives the Nernst equation:
 
E = E° - RT
nF ln Q 
[20.16]
This equation is customarily expressed in terms of the base-10 logarithm:
 
E = E° - 2.303 RT
nF
 log Q 
[20.17]
At T = 298 K, the quantity 2.303 RT>F equals 0.0592, with units of volts, and so the 
Nernst equation simplifies to
 
E = E° - 0.0592 V

 log Q  1T = 298 K2

We can use this equation to find the emf E produced by a cell under nonstandard condi-
tions or to determine the concentration of a reactant or product by measuring E for the 
cell. For example, consider the following reaction:
