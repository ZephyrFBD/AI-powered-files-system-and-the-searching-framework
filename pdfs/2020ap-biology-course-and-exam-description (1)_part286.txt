Science Practice 5: Perform statistical tests and mathematical 
calculations to analyze and interpret data. 
Students should be able to routinely use mathematics 
to solve problems, analyze experimental data, describe 
natural phenomena, make predictions, and describe 
processes symbolically. Students should also justify the 
selection of a particular mathematical routine and apply 
the routine to describe natural phenomena. 
Students should also be able to analyze data collected 
from an experimental procedure or from a given source 
to determine whether the data support or do not 
support a conclusion or hypothesis. For example, if a 
student conducts an experiment to determine if light 
intensity affects the rate of photosynthesis, he or she
