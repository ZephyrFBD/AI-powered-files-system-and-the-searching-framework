a membrane need so many different proteins? Itâ€™s because of the number of activities that take
place in or on the membrane. Generally, plasma membrane proteins fall into several broad functional groups. Some
membrane proteins (adhesion proteins) form junctions between adjacent cells. Others (receptor proteins), such as
hormones, serve as docking sites for arrivals at the cell. Some proteins (transport proteins) form pumps that use
ATP to actively transport solutes across the membrane. Others (channel proteins) form channels that selectively
allow the passage of certain ions or molecules. Finally, some proteins (cell surface markers), such as glycoproteins,
are exposed on the extracellular surface and play a role in cell recognition and adhesion.
Attached to the surface of some proteins are carbohydrate side chains. They are found only on the outer surface of
the plasma membrane. As mentioned above, cholesterol molecules are also found in the phospholipid bilayer
because they help stabi
