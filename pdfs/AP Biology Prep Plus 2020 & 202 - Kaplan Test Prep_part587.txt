e eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression not only at the
transcriptional level but also at the post-transcriptional, translational, and
post-translational levels. Transcription factors include hundreds or
thousands of proteins that exert transcriptional control over the genome.
Each protein has a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which allows it
to attach to specific DNA sequences or regulatory proteins. Together with
regulatory proteins, transcription factors can act as repressors or
activators.
An example of a regulatory DNA sequence is an enhancer sequenceâ€”a
noncoding region of DNA located upstream or downstream of a promoter.
As discussed in chapter 13, DNA is transcribed when RNA polymerase
binds to a promoter sequence. The binding of transcription factors to
enhancers enhances the transcription of an associated gene. Experimental
removal of enhancers has been shown to cause drastic decreases in gene
transcription.
One model of regulated gene expression that illustrates indu
