chamber.
Gas exchange in humans occurs as follows:
1. Nose, pharynx, larynx. Air enters the nose and passes through the nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx. The larynx
(“voice box”) contains the vocal cords.
2. Trachea. After passing through the larynx, air enters the trachea, a cartilage-lined tube. When the animal is
swallowing, a special flap called the epiglottis covers the trachea, preventing the entrance of solid and liquid
material.
3. Bronchi, bronchioles. The trachea branches into two bronchi (singular, bronchus), which enter the lungs and
then branch repeatedly, forming narrower tubes called bronchioles.
4. Alveolus . Each bronchiole branch ends in a small sac called an alveolus (plural, alveoli). Each alveolus is
densely surrounded by bloodcarrying capillaries.
5. Diffusion between alveolar chambers and blood . Gas exchange occurs by diffusion across the moist sac
membranes of the alveoli. Oxygen diffuses into the moisture covering the membrane, through the alveolar wall,
