 the system?
SOLUTION
Analyze The question asks us to determine ∆E, given information 
about q and w.
Plan We first determine the signs of q and w (Table 5.1) and then 
use Equation 5.4, ∆E = q + w, to calculate ∆E.

Although we usually have no way of knowing the precise value of the internal energy of 
a system, E, it does have a fixed value for a given set of conditions. The conditions that in-
fluence internal energy include the temperature and pressure. Furthermore, the internal 
energy of a system is proportional to the total quantity of matter in the system because 
energy is an extensive property. 
(Section 1.3)
Suppose we define our system as 50 g of water at 25 °C (Figure 5.9). The system could 
have reached this state by cooling 50 g of water from 100 to 25 °C or by melting 50 g of 
ice and subsequently warming the water to 25 °C. The internal energy of the water at 
25 °C is the same in either case. Internal energy is a
