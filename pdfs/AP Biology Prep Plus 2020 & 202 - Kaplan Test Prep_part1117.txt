commonly used in visual communication. In light of these findings, the
researchers hypothesized that UV reflectance of the dewlap might play a role in
these species’ communication displays.
Aȇer identifying five closely related species of anoles from various environments,
the researchers used sophisticated cameras to measure the UV reflectance of the
dewlaps. The mean reflectance values for UVA and UVB wavelengths as well as
the species’ natural habitats are shown in Table 1.
