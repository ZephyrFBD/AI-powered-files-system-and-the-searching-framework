†This is called a negative, because the black areas correspond to bright objects and vice versa. The
same process occurs during printing to produce a black-and-white “positive” picture from the
negative. Color film has three emulsion layers (or dyes) corresponding to the three primary colors.
‡Specifically, photons of light knock electrons in the valence band up to the conduction band. This
material on semiconductors is covered in Chapter 29.
