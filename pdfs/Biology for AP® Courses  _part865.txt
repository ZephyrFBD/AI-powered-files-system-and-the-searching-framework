If more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl CoA through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. If
either acetyl groups or NADH accumulate, there is less need for the reaction and the rate decreases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase
is also regulated by phosphorylation: A kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates
it. The kinase and the phosphatase are also regulated.
Citric Acid Cycle
The citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of
NADH (Figure 7.10). These enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and α‑ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. When adequate
ATP and NADH levels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease. When more ATP is needed, as reflected in
rising ADP levels, the rate increases. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl CoA—a
subsequent intermediate in the cycle—causing a decrease in activity. A decrease in th
