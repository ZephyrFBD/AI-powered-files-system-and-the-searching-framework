otes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their
features (Figure 14.10). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm
called the nucleoid.

Figure 14.10 A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the
cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.
In eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic
cells, both processes occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages
might there be to having them occur together?
a.
Compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells enables the building of more complex proteins and RNA products.
In prokaryotes, the advantage is that RNA and protein synthesis occurs much more quickly because it occurs
in a single compartment.
b.
Compartmentalization in prokaryotic cells enables the building of more complex proteins an
