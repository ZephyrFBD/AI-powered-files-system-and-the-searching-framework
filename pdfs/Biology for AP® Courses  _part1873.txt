 team can
determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine
the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo
genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro
fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.
Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a
good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene
is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver
the foreign DNA (Figure 17.8). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original s
