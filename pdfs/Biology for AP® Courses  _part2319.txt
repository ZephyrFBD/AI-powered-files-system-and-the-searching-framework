plest explanation is the best
explanation. Consider the repeat sequences A, B, C, D,

and E shown in the table below in which only inversions
have occurred among five different species.
Species 1 ABCDE
Species 2 ADCBE
Species 3 BACED
Species 4 DACBE
Species 5 ABCED
Species 6 DEBCA

A. Pose three questions that can be used to infer the
evolution of these five species.
B. Draw lines between nearest relatives to construct a
cladogram that displays the relationships inferred by
answers to your questions.

Carson (Drosophila Genetics 1983) used inversions in
intron-repeat sequences of the fruit fly to infer evolution
among the Hawaiian Drosophila. He further assigned the
chronological sequence of islands on which the flies
appeared by assuming (parsimoniously) that the
geologically oldest of the volcanic islands was home to the
oldest fly ancestor. When a fly or flies arrived on a newer
island, speciation occurred, wh
