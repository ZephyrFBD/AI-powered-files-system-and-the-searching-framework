idence that prokaryotic photosynthesis contributed to the production of oxygen in
the atmosphere. Furthermore, prokaryotic photosynthesis pathways laid the evolutionary foundation for eukaryotic
photosynthesis to develop. But remember, there’s much more to photosynthesis than what’s shown in the simple
reaction above.
There are two stages in photosynthesis: the light reactions (also called the light-dependent reactions) and the dark
reactions (also called the light-independent reactions). The whole process begins when photons (energy units) of
sunlight strike a leaf, activating chlorophyll and exciting electrons. The activated chlorophyll molecule then passes
these excited electrons down to a series of electron carriers, ultimately producing ATP and NADPH. Both of these
products, along with carbon dioxide, are then used in the dark reactions (light-independent) to make carbohydrates.
Along the way, water is also split and oxygen gets released.
We’ll soon see that this beautifully orche
