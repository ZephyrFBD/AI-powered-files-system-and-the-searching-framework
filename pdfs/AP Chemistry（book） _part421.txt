it is inappropriate to speak of molecules of these substances. Instead we use the empirical 
formula as the formula unit, and the formula weight of an ionic substance is determined 
by summing the atomic weights of the atoms in the empirical formula. For example, 
the formula unit of CaCl2 consists of one Ca2 +  ion and two Cl- ions. Thus, the formula 
weight of CaCl2 is
FW of CaCl2 = 40.1 amu + 2(35.5 amu) = 111.1 amu
 
Sample Exercise 3.5 
Calculating Formula Weights
Calculate the formula weight of (a) sucrose, C12H22O11 (table sugar); and (b) calcium nitrate, Ca1NO322.
SOLUTION
(a)  
By adding the atomic weights of the atoms in sucrose, we find 
the formula weight to be 342.0 amu:
12 C atoms = 12112.0 amu2 = 144.0 amu
 22 H atoms = 2211.0 amu2 =    22.0 amu
 11 O atoms = 11116.0 amu2 = 176.0 amu
342.0 amu
(b)  
If a chemical formula has parentheses, the subscript outside 
the parentheses is a multiplier for all atoms inside. Thus, for 
Ca1NO322 we have
 1 Ca atom = 1140.1 amu2 =
