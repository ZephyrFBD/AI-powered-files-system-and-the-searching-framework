 Mam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and 
 
 Bridey is offended.Don’t you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don’t 
 
 you know I had rheumatic fever an’ I could go at any time? I have to 
 
 be careful. 
 
 Mam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak 
 
 chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain 
 
 about her ailments but it doesn’t stop her from puffing away on the 
 
 Woodbines. 
 
 Mam tells Bridey she’s very sorry over the weak chest and it’s terrible 
 
 the way her father suffers.Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John 
 
 is getting worse every day,And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt,

 helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could 
 
 earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.
