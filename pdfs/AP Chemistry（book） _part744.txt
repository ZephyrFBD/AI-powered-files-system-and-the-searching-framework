 evidenced by the observed 
increase in the temperature. The magnitude of the molar enthalpy 
change seems reasonable.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
When 0.243 g of Mg metal is combined with enough HCl to 
make 100 mL of solution in a constant-pressure calorimeter, 
the following reaction occurs:
Mg1s2 + 2 HCl1aq2 ¡ MgCl21aq2 + H21g2
If the temperature of the solution increases from 23.0 to 
34.1 °C as a result of this reaction, calculate ∆H in kJ>mol Mg. 
Assume that the solution has a specific heat of 4.18 J>g@°C and 
a density of 1.00 g/mL. (a) -19.1 kJ>mol  (b) -111 kJ>mol  
(c) -191 kJ>mol (d) -464 kJ>mol (e) -961 kJ>mol
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
When 50.0 mL of 0.100 M AgNO3 and 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl 
are mixed in a constant-pressure calorimeter, the temperature 
of the mixture increases from 22.30 to 23.11 °C. The tempera-
ture increase is caused by the following reaction:
AgNO31aq2 + HCl1aq2 ¡  
AgCl1s2 + HNO31aq2
Calculate ∆H for this reaction in kJ>mol AgNO3, assuming 
that the combin
