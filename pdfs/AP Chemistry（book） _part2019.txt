ves, such as soda, air, and glass, are 
frequently mixtures. In this chapter, we examine 
homogeneous mixtures.
PROPERTIES OF 
SOLUTIONS
◀ COLORED FLOW. This microfluidic chip is similar to the one used in 
many medical diagnostic laboratories. The colored dye solutions are 
used to test the flow in each channel for proper functioning.
 13.1 ▶  The Solution Process Explore what 
happens at the molecular level when 
one substance dissolves into another; 
intermolecular forces are key. Two important 
aspects of the solution process are the 
natural tendency of particles to mix and the 
accompanying changes in energy.
 13.2 ▶  Saturated Solutions and 
Solubility Learn that when a saturated 
solution is in contact with undissolved 
solute, the dissolved and undissolved 
solutes are in dynamic equilibrium. The 
solubility of a substance in a particular 
solvent is defined as the amount of the 
substance required to make a saturated 
solution.
