That is,
(18;3)
where (Greek letter “rho”), the constant of proportionality, is called the resistivity
and depends on the material used. Typical values of 
whose units are 
(see
Eq. 18–3), are given for various materials in the middle column of Table 18–1
which is divided into the categories conductors, insulators, and semiconductors
(Section 16–3). The values depend somewhat on purity, heat treatment, temper-
ature, and other factors. Notice that silver has the lowest resistivity and is thus
the best conductor (although it is expensive). Copper is close, and much less
expensive, which is why most wires are made of copper. Aluminum, although it
has a higher resistivity, is much less dense than copper; it is thus preferable to
copper in some situations, such as for transmission lines, because its resistance
for the same weight is less than that for copper.†
