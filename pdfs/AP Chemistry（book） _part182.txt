oint should be employed or the number written in 
exponential notation. Thus, 5000. has four significant figures, 
whereas 5.00 * 103 has three.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
An object is determined to have a mass of 0.01080 g. How many 
significant figures are there in this measurement?  
(a) 2 (b) 3 (c) 4 (d) 5 (e) 6
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
How many significant figures are in each of the following  
measurements? (a) 3.549 g, (b) 2.3 * 104 cm, (c) 0.00134 m3.
Significant Figures in Calculations
Apply the following rule when carrying measured quantities through calculations. 
The least certain measurement limits the certainty of the calculated quantity and  
thereby determines the number of significant figures in the final answer. 
The final answer should be reported with only one uncertain digit. To keep track of sig-
nificant figures in calculations, we will make frequent use of two rules: one for addition and 
subtraction, and another for multiplication and division.
1. For addition and su
