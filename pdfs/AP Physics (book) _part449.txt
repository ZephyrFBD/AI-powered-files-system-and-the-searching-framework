oefficients of friction between his shoes
and the wall, and between his
back and the wall, are 0.80 and
0.60, respectively. What is the
minimum normal force he must
exert? Assume the walls are ver-
tical and that the static friction
forces are both at their maximum.
Ignore his grip on the rope.

90. A 28.0-kg block is connected to an empty 2.00-kg bucket
by a cord running over a frictionless pulley (Fig. 4–73).
The coefficient of static friction between the table and 
the block is 0.45 and the coefficient of kinetic friction 
between the table and the block is 0.32. Sand is gradually
added to the bucket until the system just begins to move.
(a) Calculate the mass of sand added to the bucket.
(b) Calculate the acceleration of the system. Ignore mass
of cord.
