s, our 
best guess would be that HCOOH is a weak acid (weak electrolyte), 
which is in fact the case. The remaining molecular compound, 
C2H5OH, is neither an acid nor a base, so it is a nonelectrolyte.
Comment Although ethanol, C2H5OH, has an OH group, it is not 
a metal hydroxide and therefore not a base. Rather, ethanol is a 
member of a class of organic compounds that have CÂ¬ OH bonds,  
which are known as alcohols. 
(Section 2.9) Organic compounds 
containing the COOH group are called carboxylic acids (Chapter 16). 
Molecules that have this group are weak acids.
a great number of water-soluble substances. Table 4.3 summarizes our observations about 
electrolytes. We first ask whether the substance is ionic or molecular. If it is ionic, it is a 
strong electrolyte. If the substance is molecular, we ask whether it is an acid or a base. (It 
is an acid if it either has H first in the chemical formula or contains a COOH group.) If 
it is an acid, we use Table 4.2 to determine whether
