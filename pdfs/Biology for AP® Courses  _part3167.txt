B. Explain the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of key ionic
elements, Na+ and Cl-, on the electric potential of the post-
synaptic membrane.

D. In the 1960s Burnstock and co-workers provided
evidence that ATP is a neurotransmitter. This was received
skeptically and largely rejected until 1984 when a
modified form of ATP that was known to block the
intracellular function of ATP was shown to effect
extracellular signal transmission. Based on the central role
played by ATP in biological systems justify the resistance
within the scientific community to accept a role f
