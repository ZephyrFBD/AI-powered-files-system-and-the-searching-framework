In this section, you will explore the following questions:
•
How do the various components of the cytoskeleton perform their functions?
Connection for AP® Courses
All cells, from simple bacteria to complex eukaryotes, possess a cytoskeleton composed of different types of protein
elements, including microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. The cytoskeleton serves a variety of
purposes: provides rigidity and shape to the cell, facilitates cellular movement, anchors the nucleus and other organelles
in place, moves vesicles through the cell, and pulls replicated chromosomes to the poles of a dividing cell. These protein
elements are also integral to the movement of centrioles, flagella, and cilia.
The information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined
