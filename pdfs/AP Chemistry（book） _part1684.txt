 gas. One potential way 
to reduce the amount of CO2 added to the atmosphere is 
to store it as a compressed gas in underground formations. 
Consider a 1000-megawatt coal-fired power plant that pro-
duces about 6 * 106 tons of CO2 per year. (a) Assuming 
ideal-gas behavior, 1.00 atm, and 27 째C, calculate the vol-
ume of CO2 produced by this power plant. (b) If the CO2 is 
stored underground as a liquid at 10 째C and 120 atm and a 
density of 1.2 g>cm3, what volume does it possess? (c) If it 
is stored underground as a gas at 30 째C and 70 atm, what 
volume does it occupy?
 10.102 Propane, C3H8, liquefies under modest pressure, allowing 
a large amount to be stored in a container. (a) Calculate 
the number of moles of propane gas in a 110-L container at 
3.00 atm and 27 째C. (b) Calculate the number of moles of 
liquid propane that can be stored in the same volume if the 
density of the liquid is 0.590 g>mL. (c) Calculate the ratio 
of the number of moles of liquid to moles of gas. Discuss
