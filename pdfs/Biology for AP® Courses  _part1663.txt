RNA Editing in Trypanosomes
The trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, which causes
sleeping sickness in humans (Figure 15.13). Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have
organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that
express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote
and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to
The Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein.
Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell performs an additional RNA
processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.
Figure 15.13 Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this
pathogen must be modified by the addition of
