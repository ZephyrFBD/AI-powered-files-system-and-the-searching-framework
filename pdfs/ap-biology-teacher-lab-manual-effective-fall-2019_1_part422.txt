 seeds from monocot plants respire at different rates from dicot plants? 
•  Do available nutrients affect the rate of respiration in germinating seeds? 
•  Can the same respirometer system be used to measure the rate of respiration in small 
invertebrates, such as insects or earthworms? 
Step 1 Design an experiment to investigate one of your own questions about cellular 
respiration or one of the questions above using microrespirometers or gas pressure 
sensors. When identifying your design, be sure to address the following: 
•  What is the essential question being addressed? 
•  What assumptions are made about the question(s) being addressed? Can those 
assumptions be verified? 
•  Will the measurements you choose to make provide the necessary data to answer the 
question under study? 
•  Did you include a control in your experiment? 
•  What are possible sources of error in the experiment(s)? 
Step 2 Make a hypothesis, which should include a prediction about the effect of the 
facto
