uct an appropriately labeled graph of the experimental data.
(c) Calculate the average rate of carbon dioxide production per minute at each temperature.
(d) A fourth experimental apparatus is placed in a beaker of water at a temperature of 10° Celsius. Add a line
to your graph from part (b) that predicts the rate of cellular respiration at 10° Celsius. Justify your
prediction.
Answer Explanations
Multiple-Choice
1. (C) Fermentation oxidizes NADH into NAD+ so that NAD+ can be used in glycolysis. Choice (A) is incorrect
because fermentation does not produce ATP. Pyruvate is a reactant used in fermentation, not a product of
fermentation, so choice (B) is incorrect. While carbon dioxide is a product of alcohol fermentation, carbon
dioxide is not always produced by fermentation (for example, lactic acid fermentation does not produce carbon
dioxide). So choice (D) is incorrect.
2. (A) Glycolysis does not produce carbon dioxide. Choices (B), (C), and (D) all produce carbon dioxide, so all
