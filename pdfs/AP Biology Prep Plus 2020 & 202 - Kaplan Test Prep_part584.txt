haploid cells (containing one set of chromosomes, 1N). During
fertilization, a sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell to produce a single cell
called a zygote. (Sexual reproduction can also occur when a
hermaphroditic organism fertilizes its own eggs to form oﬀspring.) The
fusion of one sperm with one egg, both of which are haploid, restores the
diploid number of chromosomes. Since each zygote is genetically
diﬀerent, fertilization increases genetic variation and contributes to the
survival of a species.
Fertilization is the first step in embryogenesis—the process by which an
embryo forms and develops. Aȇer fertilization, the zygote undergoes
cleavage (cell division without an increase in mass) and cellular
diﬀerentiation to form a multicellular organism.
14.1 Describe the process of fertilization and genetic transfer
Fertilization can occur within the body or outside of the body. Internal
fertilization typically occurs in the female reproductive organs of
mammals and birds, while extern
