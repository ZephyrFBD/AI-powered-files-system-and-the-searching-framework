Next consider box B. The force of gravity
pulls downward; and the cord pulls upward with a force 
So we can write
Newton’s second law for box B (taking the downward direction as positive):
[box B]
[Notice that if
then 
is not equal to 
]
We have two unknowns, a and 
and we also have two equations. We solve
the box A equation for 
and substitute this into the box B equation:
Now we solve for a and put in numerical values:
which is the acceleration of box A to the right, and of box B down.
If we wish, we can calculate 
using the third equation up from here:
NOTE Box B is not in free fall. It does not fall at
because an additional
force,
is acting upward on it.
