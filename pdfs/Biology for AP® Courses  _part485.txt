Figure 4.30 A desmosome forms a very strong spot weld between cells. It is created by the linkage of cadherins and
intermediate filaments. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
Gap Junctions
Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that
allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 4.31). Structurally,
however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ.
Figure 4.31 A gap junction is a protein-lined pore that allows water and small molecules to pass between adjacent
animal cells. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
Gap junctions develop when a set of six proteins (called connexins) in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in an
elongated donut-like configuration called a connexon. Wh
