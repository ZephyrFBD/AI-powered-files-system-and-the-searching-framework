11. Hox genes belong to a family of conserved genes that determine
the characteristics of diﬀerent segments of the body. Hox genes
regulate the diﬀerentiation of stem cells during development.
Diﬀerent Hox genes are activated or deactivated based on where
the stem cells are located in the body. For example, in mouse
embryos, Hox10 genes are active in the lower back region, where
there are no ribs, but inactive in the rib cage region. This diﬀerent
pattern of Hox10 gene expressions ensures that ribs develop in
the thorax. Hox genes are also found in snakes, which possess ribs
along their entire body.
Based on this information, which of the following is most
reasonable to conclude about the role of the Hox genes in snakes?
Hox10 genes may be present, but are always active in snakes.
(A)
Hox10 genes may be present, but are always inactive in
snakes.
(B)
Snakes never possessed the Hox10 genes since snakes
evolved before mice.
(C)
Snakes have likely lost all H
