e of death in the United States.
On average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes
occur in people older than 65. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family
history of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to
the emergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not
work if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the
hospital. Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes
intense) physical therapy.
