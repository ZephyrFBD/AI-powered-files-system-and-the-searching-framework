8–2 Constant Angular Acceleration
In Chapter 2, we derived the useful kinematic equations (Eqs. 2–11) that relate
acceleration, velocity, distance, and time for the special case of uniform linear
acceleration. Those equations were derived from the definitions of linear 
velocity and acceleration, assuming constant acceleration. The definitions of
angular velocity and angular acceleration (Eqs. 8–2 and 8–3) are just like those
for their linear counterparts, except that 
replaces the linear displacement x,
replaces v,
and 
replaces a. Therefore,
the angular equations for 
constant angular acceleration will be analogous to Eqs. 2–11 with x replaced
by
v by 
and a by 
and they can be derived in exactly the same way.

We summarize these angular equations here, opposite their linear equivalents,
Eqs. 2–11 (for simplicity we choose
