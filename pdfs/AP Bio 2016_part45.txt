f
how the new disease will affect the two
populations?
(A) The two populations will be equally affected,
because the ability to trigger an immune 
response is randomly distributed among all 
squirrels of that species. 
(B) The larger population will be less affected by 
the disease than will the smaller population, 
because the mutation rate of the larger 
population is higher than the mutation rate 
of the smaller population. 
(C) The smaller population will be more affected 
than will the larger population, because the 
smaller population has less genetic variation 
than the larger population has. 
(D) The smaller population will be less affected 
than will the larger population, because the 
smaller population exhibits more genetic 
drift than the larger population exhibits.

and contain their own DNA and ribosomes that
are similar to those typical of many prokaryotic
cells. Which of the following statements is
