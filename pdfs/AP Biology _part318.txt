he 5′ to the 3′ direction
by moving along the template strand and pushing the replication
fork ahead of it. In humans, the rate of elongation is about 50
nucleotides per second.
DNA polymerase cannot initiate synthesis; it can only add
nucleotides to the 3′ end of a preexisting chain. This preexisting
chain actually consists of RNA and is called RNA primer. An
enzyme called primase makes the primer by joining together RNA
nucleotides.
One of your cells can replicate its entire DNA in a few hours.
DNA polymerase replicates the two original strands of DNA
differently. Although it builds both new strands in the 5′ to 3′
direction, one strand is formed toward the replication fork in an
unbroken, linear fashion. This is called the leading strand. The
other strand, the lagging strand, forms in the direction away from
the replication fork in a series of segments called Okazaki
fragments. Okazaki fragments are about 100–200 nucleotides long
and will be joined into one continuous strand by the
