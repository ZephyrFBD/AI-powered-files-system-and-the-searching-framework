3. Homeotic genes are master genes that specify the developmental patterns of groups of cells. For example, in fruit
flies, these genes drive the formation of basic body structures such as body segments and antennae. Mutant homeotic
genes in fruit flies are responsible for producing body parts in the wrong places, such as legs where antennae should
be. Features of homeotic genes follow.
A homeobox is a 180-nucleotide sequence found in all homeotic genes. It codes for a protein that is 60 amino acids
long.
Hox genes are genes that contain the homeobox and direct the development of a specific body part. The proteins for
which Hox genes code act as transcription factors that control gene expression.
Hox genes occur in clusters. The order of the Hox genes on the DNA dictates the spatial order of their expression.
For example, the order of Hox genes in the fruit fly mirror the spatial order of the body segments for which the
genes code. Thus, the order o
