igations also 
provide suggestions for extending the 
investigation(s) (Where Can Students 
Go from Here?). These suggestions 
appear in both the Teacher Manual and 
Student Manual versions of the labs.
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 3: 
Creating Student-Directed, 
Inquiry-Based Lab Investigations 
Laboratory investigations should engage students, promote critical thinking and active 
learning, and encourage collaboration among students and between student and teacher 
(Johnson 2009). The focus of the laboratory experience is not on students achieving 
predetermined results, but on students making their own observations, raising questions, 
and strategizing how to investigate them. 
The benefits to students of conducting their own investigations outweigh any 
disadvantages. Advantages include more rapid development of thinking processes and 
application skills. The biggest disadvantage is the amount of time that may be required 
for students to conduct their own investigations.
