ely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of YY:Yy:yy genotypes of 1:2:1 (Figure 12.4). Furthermore, because
the YY and Yy offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect
the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green. Indeed, working with large sample sizes, Mendel observed
approximately this ratio in every F2 generation resulting from crosses for individual traits.
Mendel validated these results by performing an F3 cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing
F2 plants. When he self-crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green seeds, confirming that all
green seeds had homozygous genotypes of yy. When he self-crossed the F2 plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that
one-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. In this case,
the true-breeding plants had homozygous (YY) genotypes, w
