ENERGY DYNAMICS
What factors govern energy capture, allocation, 
storage, and transfer between producers and 
consumers in a terrestrial ecosystem?
 
■BACKGROUND
Almost all life on this planet is powered, either directly or indirectly, by sunlight. Energy 
captured from sunlight drives the production of energy-rich organic compounds 
during the process of photosynthesis. These organic compounds create biomass. The net 
amount of energy captured and stored by the producers in a system is the system’s net 
productivity. Gross productivity is a measure of the total energy captured. I
