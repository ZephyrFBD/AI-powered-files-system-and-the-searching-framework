What effect do these changes have on ∆H for a reaction:
(a) Reversing the reaction
(b) Multiplying the coefficients of the equation for the reaction by 2?

Enthalpy
▲ Figure 5.21 Enthalpy diagram for  
combustion of 1 mol of methane. The enthalpy  
change of the one-step reaction equals the sum  
of the enthalpy changes of the reaction run in  
two steps: -890 kJ = -802 kJ + 1-88 kJ2.
The net equation is
CH41g2 + 2 O21g2 ¡  CO21g2 + 2 H2O1l2 ∆H = -890 kJ
Hess’s law states that if a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, ∆H 
for the overall reaction equals the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individ-
ual steps. The overall enthalpy change for the process is independent of 
the number of steps and independent of the path by which the reaction 
is carried out. This law is a consequence of the fact that enthalpy is a st
