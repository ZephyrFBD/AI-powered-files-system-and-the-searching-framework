RNA instead of
DNA and replicate in an unusual way. Following infection of the
host cell, the retrovirus RNA serves as a template for the synthesis
of complementary DNA (cDNA) because it is complementary to
the RNA from which it was copied. Thus, these retroviruses reverse
the usual flow of information from DNA to RNA. This reverse
transcription occurs under the direction of an enzyme called
reverse transcriptase. A retrovirus usually inserts itself into the
host genome, becomes a permanent resident, called a prophage,
and is capable of making multiple copies of the viral genome for
years. 
An 
example 
of 
a 
retrovirus 
is 
HIV 
(human
immunodeficiency virus), which causes AIDS.
TRANSDUCTIONâ€”Phage viruses acquire bits of bacterial DNA as
they infect one cell after another. This process, which leads to
genetic recombination, is called transduction. Two types of
transduction occur: generalized and restricted (specialized).
Generalized transduction moves random pieces of bacterial DNA
