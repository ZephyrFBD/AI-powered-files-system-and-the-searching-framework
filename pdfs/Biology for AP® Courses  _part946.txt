d PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic
electron transport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex. The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed
of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin
(Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to
PSI.
The reaction center of PSII (called P680) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the primary electron
acceptor, and through the electron transport chain (Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI. P680â€™s missing
electron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and PSII is re-reduced after every
photoact. Splitting one H2O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen. Splitting two
molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O2 gas. About 10 percent of the oxygen is used b
