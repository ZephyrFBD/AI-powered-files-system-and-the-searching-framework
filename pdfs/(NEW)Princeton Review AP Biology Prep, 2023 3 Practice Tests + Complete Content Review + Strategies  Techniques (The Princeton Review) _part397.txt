etches of time, these two different populations might change so much that they could no
longer reproduce together. At that point, we would have two different species, and we could say, definitively, that
the moths had evolved. Evolution occurred as a consequence of random mutation and the pressure put on the
population by an environmental change. Catastrophic events can speed up natural selection and adaptation. When
the rules change, sometimes odd variations are selected for. Earth has undergone several mass extinction events. The
tree of life would look much different if these events had not occurred.
Phenotypes Not Genotypes
Remember, it is a phenotype that can be selected for/against. It is not the
genotype. Genotypes are hidden away inside the DNA; only the phenotype will
be exposed to the environmental pressures.
Genetic drift is something that causes a change in the genetics of a population, but it is not natural selection.
Instead, it is caused by random events that drastically
