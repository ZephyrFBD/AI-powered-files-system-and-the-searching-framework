Sample Exercise 14.13
Practice Exercise 2: (a) Rate = k3NO423Br24, (b) No, because 
 
termolecular reactions are very rare.
Sample Exercise 14.14
Practice Exercise 2: Because the rate law conforms to the molecularity 
of the first step, the first step must be the rate-determining step. The 
second step must be much faster than the first one.
