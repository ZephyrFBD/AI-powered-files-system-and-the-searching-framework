thene cannot rotate, so the atoms on either side are locked in place.
Hydrocarbon Rings
So far, the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons, which consist of linear chains of carbon
atoms. Another type of hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbons, consists of closed rings of carbon atoms. Ring structures
are found in hydrocarbons, sometimes with the presence of double bonds, which can be seen by comparing the structure of
cyclohexane to benzene in Figure 2.25. Examples of biological molecules that incorporate the benzene ring include some
amino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone. The benzene ring is also
found in the herbicide 2,4-D. Benzene is a natural component of crude oil and has been classified as a carcinogen. Some
hydrocarbons have both aliphatic and aromatic portions; beta-carotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon.
