of an atom. (Section 6.8)
corrosion Spontaneous redox reactions in which a metal is 
attacked by some substance in its environment and converted to 
an unwanted compound. (Section 20.8)
covalent bond A bond formed between two or more atoms by a 
sharing of electrons. (Chapter 8: Introduction)
covalent-network solids Solids that are held together by an 
extended network of covalent bonds. (Sections 12.1 and 12.7)
critical mass The amount of fissionable material necessary to 
maintain a nuclear chain reaction. (Section 21.7)
critical point The temperature and pressure beyond which the 
liquid and gas phases are indistinguishable from each other. 
(Section 11.6)
critical pressure The pressure at which a gas at its critical 
temperature is converted to a liquid state. (Section 11.4)
critical temperature The highest temperature at which a distinct 
liquid phase can form. The critical temperature increases with an 
increase in the magnitude of intermolecular forces. (Section 11.4)
