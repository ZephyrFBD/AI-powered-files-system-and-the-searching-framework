re is estimated to be 0.8 { 0.1 yr. That is, a collection 
of CH3Br molecules present at any given time will, on aver-
age, be 50% decomposed after 0.8 yr, 75% decomposed 
after 1.6 yr, and so on. A half-life of 0.8 yr, while compara-
tively short, is still sufficiently long so that CH3Br contrib-
utes significantly to the destruction of the ozone layer.
In 1997 an international agreement was reached to 
phase out use of methyl bromide in developed countries 
by 2005. Although exemptions for critical agricultural use 
have been granted, global consumption in 2013 was only 
3% of the levels seen in the early 1990s.
