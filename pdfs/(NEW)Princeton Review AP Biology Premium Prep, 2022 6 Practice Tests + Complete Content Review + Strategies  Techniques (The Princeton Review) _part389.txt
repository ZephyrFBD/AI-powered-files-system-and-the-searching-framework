’s genetic makeup. By about 1950,
the gene pool reached 90 percent dark alleles and only 10 percent light alleles. This occurred because the light moths
didn’t stand a chance in an environment where they were so easy to spot. The dark moths, on the other hand,
multiplied just as fast as they could.
In the southern city, you’ll remember, there was very little pollution. What happened there? Things remained pretty
much the same. The gene pool was unchanged, and the population continued to have roughly equal proportions of
light moths and dark moths.
CAUSES OF EVOLUTION
Natural selection, the evolutionary mechanism that “selects” which members of a population are best suited to
survive and which are not, works both “internally” and “externally”: internally through random mutations and
externally through environmental pressures. Biotic and abiotic factors can fluctuate and this can affect the direction
of evolution. With each generation, different traits might be selected for depending on
