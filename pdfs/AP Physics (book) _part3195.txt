h-speed electrons. Measurement of these
peaks allows determination of inner energy levels of atoms and
determination of atomic number Z.
[ Fluorescence occurs when absorbed UV photons are
followed by emission of visible light, due to the special
arrangement of energy levels of atoms of the material.
Phosphorescent materials have metastable states (long-lived)
that emit light seconds or minutes after absorption of light.]
Lasers
produce a narrow beam of monochromatic
coherent light (light waves in phase).
[*Holograms are images with a 3-dimensional quality,
formed by interference of laser light.]

Summary
Volume or white-light holograms do not require a laser to see the image, but
can be viewed with ordinary white light (preferably a nearly point source, such as
the Sun or a clear bulb with a small bright filament). Such holograms must be
made, however, with a laser. They are made not on thin film, but on a thick emul-
