raw conclusions about the relatedness of species, so rule out (C) and (D).

Heterotrophic zooplankton rapidly deplete the biomass of autotrophic phytoplankton,
which allows the zooplankton to have a larger standing crop. This is sustainable because
phytoplankton can reproduce very quickly to replenish consumed biomass. However,
because the zooplankton are continually grazing down the phytoplankton, the
phytoplankton standing crop population size remains small. (D) is thus correct. (A) is
factually inaccurate: phytoplankton species tend to be much smaller than many
terrestrial plant species. (B) is an oversimplification; aquatic organisms do not
necessarily require less food than terrestrial organisms of comparable size. (C) fails to
answer the question; even if measuring biomass in aquatic systems is more diï¬€icult, it
does not explain the dramatic departure of their biomass pyramids from those of
terrestrial systems.
