 (a) One of these graphs shows data for a liquid crystalline 
material. Which one? (b) In graph A, what process does the 
2–3 line segment correspond to? (c) In graph B, what pro-
cess does the 2–3 line segment correspond to? (d) In graph 
A, what process does the 3–4 line segment correspond to? 
(e) In graph B, what process does the 3–4 line segment cor-
respond to?
 11.69  For a given substance, the liquid crystalline phase tends to 
be more viscous than the liquid phase. Why?
 11.70  Describe how a cholesteric liquid crystal phase differs from 
a nematic phase.
 11.71  It often happens that a substance possessing a smectic liq-
uid crystalline phase just above the melting point passes 
into a nematic liquid crystalline phase at a higher tempera-
ture. Account for this type of behavior.
 11.72  The smectic liquid crystalline phase can be said to be more 
highly ordered than the nematic phase. In what sense is 
this true?
of the fact that the triple point of water 1T = 0.
