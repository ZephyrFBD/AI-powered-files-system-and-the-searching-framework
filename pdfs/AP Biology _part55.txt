ing units called
nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of a phosphate (P), a 5-carbon sugar
—deoxyribose or ribose, and a nitrogen base—adenine (A), cytosine
(C), guanine (G), or either thymine (T) (in DNA) or uracil (U) (in RNA).
The carbon atoms of deoxyribose are numbered from 1 to 5. DNA consists
of two strands that run in opposite directions. One strand runs 5′ to 3′, and
the other runs 3′ to 5′. See Figure 2.15. Nucleic acids are also discussed in
Chapter 8.

Functional Groups
The components of organic molecules that are most often involved in
chemical reactions are known as functional groups. These groups are
attached to the carbon skeleton, replacing one or more hydrogen atoms that
would be present in a hydrocarbon. For example, the difference between
testosterone and estradiol is the functional group attached to the carbon
skeleton. Each functional group behaves in a consistent fashion from one
organic molecule to anothe
