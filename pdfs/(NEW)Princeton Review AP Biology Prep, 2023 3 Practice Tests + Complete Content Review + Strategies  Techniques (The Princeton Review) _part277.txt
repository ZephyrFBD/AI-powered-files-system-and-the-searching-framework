Now the cell has plenty of room to “sort out” the chromosomes. Remember centrioles? During prophase, these
cylindrical bodies found within microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) start to move away from each other,
toward opposite ends of the cell. The centrioles will spin out a system of microtubules known as the spindle fibers.
These spindle fibers will attach to a kinetochore, a structure on each chromatid. The kinetochores are part of the
centromere.
Another name for this MTOC in animal cells is the centrosome.
Stage 2: Metaphase: Middle (chromosomes align in the middle)
The next stage is called metaphase. The chromosomes now begin to line up along the equatorial plane, or the
metaphase plate, of the cell. This happens because spindle fibers are attached to the kinetochore of each chromatid.
Stage 3: Anaphase: Apart (chromatids are pulled apart)
During anaphase, sister chromatids of each chromosome separate at the centromere and migrate to opposite poles.
Chromatids are pulled
