 cell. It should have a signal sequence, but it
should not have a targeting signal or a localization sequence. The only protein that meets these
requirements is K8TE.

B
The electron transport chain in humans occurs in mitochondria. Proteins destined for the mitochondria
should have a localization sequence. The only two proteins that have a localization sequence are NUH8
and LNACT.

B
HAZL2 has none of the sequences or signals represented in the data table. Proteins without these features
would remain in the cytosol where it is assembled, so a scientist would have to collect samples that
contain cytosol.

D
The raccoon population seems steady, with a slight dip in 2008. If raccoons rely on berries as a primary
food source, then it is likely that the berry population would have also remained stable.

B
The cougar population is shown to be decreasing over time. One possible explanation for the decline may
be due to a disappearing food source, so the food source should also sh
