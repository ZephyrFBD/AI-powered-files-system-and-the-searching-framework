hree alleles determine the particular blood-type
protein on the surface of red blood cells. Each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles
for a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the individuals that make up the population. Mendel followed
alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring. In the early twentieth century, biologists in a field of study known
as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic
frequencies.
The allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the proportion of a specific allele within a population, relative to all other alleles
of that gene that are present in the population. Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of
a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, the term evolution
is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. U
