ame organelles and structures seen in animal cells, with several key exceptions.
Plant cells, unlike animal cells, have a protective outer covering called the cell wall (made of cellulose). A cell wall
is a rigid layer just outside the plasma membrane that provides support for the cell. It is found in plants, protists,
fungi, and bacteria. Cell walls are important for protection against osmotic changes as well. In fungi, the cell wall is
usually made of chitin, a modified polysaccharide. Chitin is also a principle component of an arthropodâ€™s
exoskeleton. In addition, plant cells possess chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, the light-capturing
pigment that gives plants their characteristic green color. Because chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis, we
will discuss them in more detail in Chapter 6.
Did You Know?
Chloroplasts are found in plants and photosynthetic algae.
Another difference between plant and animal cells is that most of the cytoplasm within a plant cell is
