etabolic rate
of cells in the body. When thyroxin levels are low, the hypothalamus secretes thyrotropinreleasing hormone (TRH),
which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH). In turn, TSH stimulates the
thyroid gland to secrete more thyroxin, TRH production slows, and homeostasis is established. The following
examples illustrate what happens when the environment or disease interferes with this negative feedback
mechanism.
Goiter is a condition that occurs when iodine is undersupplied in the diet. When iodine is deficient, thyroxin
production declines. In an effort to boost thyroxin production, the hypothalamus secretes more TRH. But this has no
effect on thyroxin production because of the iodine deficiency. Continued efforts to boost production result in an
enlargement of the thyroid gland (and neck). A return of iodine to the diet reverses the symptoms.
Gravesâ€™ disease is an autoimmune condition caused by the overproduction of thyroxin (hyperthy
