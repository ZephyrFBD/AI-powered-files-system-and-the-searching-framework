58. (a) What is the speed v of an electron whose kinetic energy
is 14,000 times its rest energy? You can state the answer as
the difference 
Such speeds are reached in the Stan-
ford Linear Accelerator, SLAC. (b) If the electrons travel
in the lab through a tube 3.0 km long (as at SLAC), how
long is this tube in the electrons’ reference frame? [Hint:
Use the binomial expansion.]
59. What minimum amount of electromagnetic energy is
needed to produce an electron and a positron together?
A positron is a particle with the same mass as an electron,
but has the opposite charge. (Note that electric charge is
conserved in this process. See Section 27–6.)
60. How many grams of matter would have to be totally
destroyed to run a 75-W lightbulb for 1.0 year?
61. A free neutron can decay into a proton, an electron, and a
neutrino. Assume the neutrino’s mass is zer
