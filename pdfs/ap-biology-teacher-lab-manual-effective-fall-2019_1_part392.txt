ers containing only glass beads? Your 
answer should refer to the concepts derived from the general gas law, 
PV = nRT 
2. What happens to the volume of the gas being measured (O2 consumption or 
production) when the temperature or pressure changes during the experiment? 
If pressure and temperature remain constant, will the volume of gas in the 
respirometers increase or decrease? Please explain. Hint: Several tutorials and 
animations explaining the general gas law are available online (e.g.,  
http://www.nclark.net/GasLaws). 
3. Imagine that you are given 25 germinating pea seeds that have been placed in boiling 
water for 5 minutes. You place these seeds in a respirometer and collect data. Predict 
the rate of oxygen consumption (i.e., cellular respiration) for these seeds, and explain 
your reasons. 
4. Imagine that you are asked to measure the rate of respiration for a 25 g reptile and 
a 25 g mammal at 10Â°C. Predict how the results would compare and justify your 
prediction.
