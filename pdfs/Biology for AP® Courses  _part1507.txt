Neanderthal Genome: How Are We Related?
The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published by Richard E. Green et al.
in 2010.
[1] Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have
lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years
ago. Greenâ€™s team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across
the world. Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed
because of the frag
