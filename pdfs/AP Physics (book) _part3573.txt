in the child being pushed backward by the impulse. This is the equiv-
alent of a repulsive force. On the other hand, if the two children exchange pillows
by grabbing them out of the other person’s hand, they will be pulled toward 
each other, as when an attractive force acts.
For the electromagnetic force, it is photons exchanged between two charged
particles that give rise to the force between them. A simple diagram describ-
ing this photon exchange is shown in Fig. 32–8. Such a diagram, called a
Feynman diagram after its inventor, the American physicist Richard Feynman
(1918–1988), is based on the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED).
