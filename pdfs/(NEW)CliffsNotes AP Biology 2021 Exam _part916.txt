 of the cuvettes follows:
Cuvette 1: 0.2 ml succinate added to isolated mitochondria Cuvette 2: 0.1 ml succinate added to isolated
mitochondria Cuvette 3: 0 ml succinate added to isolated mitochondria
Cuvette 4: 0.1 ml succinate added to isolated mitochondria preheated to 100Â°C
 
Transmittance in each cuvette is measured every 10 minutes. The results of the experiment are summarized in the
following graph.
 
26. The results of the experiment indicate that the
respiratory rate increases as
A. the concentration of substrate increases
B. the concentration of DPIP increases
C. the concentration of enzyme increases
D. the time increases
27. Which of the following is true with respect to the availability of electrons from other steps of the Krebs cycle?
A. No other steps of the Krebs cycle are involved in the reduction of electron acceptors.
B. Electrons from other steps could also reduce DPIP, but the substrates for these steps are consumed before
succinate is added.
C. FAD is the only elec
