FIGURE 8;21 Example 8–10.
Additional Example—a bit more challenging
Pulley and bucket. Consider again the pulley in Example 8–10.
But instead of a constant 15.0-N force being exerted on the cord, we now have a
bucket of weight 
(mass 
) hanging from the cord.
See Fig. 8–22a. We assume the cord has negligible mass and does not stretch or slip
on the pulley. Calculate the angular acceleration of the pulley and the linear accel-
eration a of the bucket. Assume the same frictional torque 
acts.
APPROACH This situation looks a lot like Example 8–10, Fig. 8–21. But there is
a big difference: the tension in the cord is now an unknown, and it is no longer
equal to the weight of the bucket if the bucket accelerates. Our system has two
parts: the bucket, which can undergo translational motion (Fig. 8–22b is its free-
body diagram); and the pulley. The pulley does not translate, but it can rotate.
We apply the rotational version of Newton’s second law to the p
