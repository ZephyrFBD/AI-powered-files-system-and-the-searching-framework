to its volume. Therefore, the lungs control
the volume of air by altering the air pressure of the thoracic cavity.
b.
Boyle’s law states the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume. Therefore, the lungs control
air pressure by altering the volume of the thoracic cavity.
c.
Boyle’s law states the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume. Therefore, the lungs control
air pressure by expanding and pushing out the muscles of the thoracic cavity.
d.
Boyle’s law states the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its volume. Therefore, the lungs control air
pressure by controlling the volume of the thoracic cavity, not vice versa.
The Work of Breathing
The number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate. On average, under non-exertion conditions, the human respiratory
rate is 12–15 breaths/minute. The respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation, or how much air moves into
and out of the alveoli. Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon di
