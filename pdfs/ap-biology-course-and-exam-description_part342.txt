n of exposing some mosquitoes to untreated filter paper each time the experiment was performed.
• Exposing mosquitoes to untreated filter paper confirms that any observed mortality is from the 
insecticides rather than from the filter paper itself or any other experimental conditions.

Describe whether mosquitoes from region A or from region B are more likely to exhibit greater 
evolutionary fitness if exposed to permethrin in their native environment over the time period of the 
experiment.
• Mosquitoes from region A are much more likely to survive to reproduce, so the region A mosquitoes will 
have greater evolutionary fitness.

4.B
Describe any significant change in the susceptibility of mosquitoes from region B to each of the two 
insecticides over the two-year period.
• For permethrin, there was little significant change in susceptibility until the June 2010 test, when the 
mosquitoes were significantly less susceptible than they h
