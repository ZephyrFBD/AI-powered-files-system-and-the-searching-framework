endent variable, which is something set by the experimenter. The
dependent variable is the thing that is measured as data. So germination is the independent variable, and
ppt of oxygen is the dependent variable. The temperature is a constant in this instance as every point on
the graph is meant to show germination at that given temperature. Often, temperature will be the
independent variable in an experiment.

The graph shows that oxygen consumed starts at 0 and then increases. In photosynthesis, oxygen is
released. In fermentation, there is no oxygen present. This must be cellular respiration, which requires
oxygen.

The trend over the 4 points that seem to fall on a line averages 0.1 every 2 days. This would increase it to
0.6 on day 7.

D
In its high-energy conformation, myosin is bound to ADP. ATP is hydrolyzed as it enters the high-energy
state, so it should only have ADP bound once it gets there. It will also bind actin.

C
Without a fresh ATP to bind, myosin will
