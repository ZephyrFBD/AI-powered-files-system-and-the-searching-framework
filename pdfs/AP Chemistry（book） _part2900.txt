The climate change threat posed by atmospheric CO2 has sparked considerable 
research into ways of capturing the gas at its largest combustion sources and storing it 
under ground or under the seafloor. There is also much interest in developing new ways 
to use CO2 as a chemical feedstock. However, the approximately 115 million tons of CO2 
used annually by the global chemical industry is but a small fraction of the approxi-
mately 24 billion tons of annual CO2 emissions. The use of CO2 as a raw material will 
probably never be great enough to significantly reduce its atmospheric concentration.
Give It Some Thought
Explain why nighttime temperatures remain higher in locations where there  
is higher humidity.
Although CO2 receives most of the attention, other gases contribute 
to the greenhouse effect, including methane, CH4, hydroﬂuorocar-
bons (HFCs), and chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs).
HFCs have replaced CFCs in a host of applications, including 
refrigerants and air
