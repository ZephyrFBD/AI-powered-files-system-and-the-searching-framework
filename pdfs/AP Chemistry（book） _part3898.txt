2 * 10-3. (a) Why does pyruvic acid have a larger acid-dissociation constant 
than acetic acid? (b) Would you expect pyruvic acid to exist primarily as the neutral acid or as dissociated ions in muscle tissue, 
assuming a pH of 7.4 and an initial acid concentration of 2 * 10-4 M? (c) What would you predict for the solubility properties of 
pyruvic acid? Explain. (d) What is the hybridization of each carbon atom in pyruvic acid? (e) Assuming H atoms as the reducing 
agent, write a balanced chemical equation for the reduction of pyruvic acid to lactic acid (Figure 24.13). (Although H atoms do 
not exist as such in biochemical systems, biochemical reducing agents deliver hydrogen for such reductions.)

Putting Concepts Together
SOLUTION
(a) The acid-dissociation constant for pyruvic acid should be 
somewhat greater than that of acetic acid because the car-
bonyl function on the a@carbon atom of pyruvic acid exerts an 
electron-withdrawing effect on the carboxyl
