 when male and female genitalia are structurally incompatible or when flower
structures select for different pollinators.
5. Gametic isolation occurs when male gametes do not survive in the environment of the female gamete (such as in
internal fertilization) or when female gametes do not recognize male gametes.
The second category, postzygotic isolating mechanisms, consists of mechanisms that prevent the formation of
fertile progeny: 6. Hybrid inviability occurs when the zygote fails to develop properly and aborts, or dies, before
reaching reproductive maturity.
7. Hybrid sterility occurs when hybrids become functional adults, but are reproductively sterile (eggs or sperm are
nonexistent or dysfunctional). The mule, a sterile offspring of a donkey and a horse, is a sterile hybrid.
8. Hybrid breakdown occurs when hybrids produce offspring that have reduced viability or fertility.
Patterns of Evolution
The evolution of species is often categorized into the following four patterns (Figure
