bic meter contains 1000 dm3, 1 m3 =  
1000 dm3. One liter is the same volume 
as one cubic decimeter, 1 L = 1 dm3. 
Each cubic decimeter contains 1000 
cubic centimeters, 1 dm3 = 1000 cm3. 
One cubic centimeter equals one 
milliliter, 1 cm3 = 1 mL.

How many 1-L bottles are required to 
contain 1 m3 of liquid?
 
Sample Exercise 1.3
Converting Units of Temperature
A weather forecaster predicts the temperature will reach 31 °C. What is this temperature (a) in K, (b) in °F?
would be liquid at 525 K (assume samples are protected  
from air): (a) bismuth, Bi; (b) platinum, Pt; (c) selenium, Se;  
(d) calcium, Ca; (e) copper, Cu.
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Ethylene glycol, the major ingredient in antifreeze, freezes  
at -11.5   °C. What is the freezing point in (a) K, (b) °F?
SOLUTION
(a) Equation 1.3, we have K = 31 + 273 = 304 K.
(b) Using Equation 1.4, we have 
°F = 9
51312 + 32 = 56 + 32 = 88 °F.
