. So enzyme levels cannot be used to
monitor the progress of a reaction. Enzymes lower the energy
needed to begin the reaction (the EA), but they do not affect the
temperature of the system. (ENE-1)
(B) The reaction is exergonic because “energy” is on the right side of
the reaction—in other words, the reaction releases energy. Choice A
is not correct because hydrolysis is the breaking down of a molecule,
but, in this example, AB is being built up. Choice C is not correct
because endergonic and endothermic are synonyms for a reaction
that requires or absorbs energy. Choice D is not correct because,
according to the first law of thermodynamics, energy can never be
created or destroyed; it can only be transferred, released, or
absorbed. (ENE-1)
(C) Enzymes lower the energy of activation. (ENE-1)
(D) The potential energy (PE) of the product is the same for both
reactions. (ENE-1)
(A) The key here is that when malonate was added to the system,
succinate appeared in excess and there was a de
