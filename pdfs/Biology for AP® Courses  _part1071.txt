ic head group
cleavage product of PIP2 that is used for signaling within the cell
communication between cells
(also, intracellular receptor) receptor protein that is located in the cytosol of a cell and binds to ligands
that pass through the plasma membrane
(also, second messenger) small molecule that transmits signals within a cell
communication within cells
cell-surface receptor that forms a plasma membrane channel, which opens when a ligand
binds to the extracellular domain (ligand-gated channels)
enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another molecule
molecule produced by a signaling cell that binds with a specific receptor, delivering a signal in the process
signaling molecule secreted by yeast cells to communicate to nearby yeast cells that they are available to
mate and communicating their mating orientation
