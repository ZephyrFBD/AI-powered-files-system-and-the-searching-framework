 to find mates in the future.
More recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and
how this is affected by previous matings (Figure 36.8).
[2] Males were allowed to select between smaller
and larger females. Findings showed that larger females had greater fecundity, producing twice as many
offspring per mating as the smaller females did. Males that had previously mated, and thus had lower
supplies of sperm, were termed “resource-depleted,” while males that had not mated were termed “non-
resource-depleted.” The study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with
larger females, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. Thus,
males with depleted sperm supplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before
they replenished their sperm supply, selected larger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances
for offspring. This study was one of the
