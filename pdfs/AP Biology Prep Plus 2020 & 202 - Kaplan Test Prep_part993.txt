The Porifera are divided into Calcarea and Silicarea.

11. If the scientists who created the morphology-based tree relied
mainly on phenotypic comparisons of adult and developing
organisms, while those who created the molecular-based tree
compared homologous hedgehog genes (a gene important for
development), then which of the following statements would both
teams of scientists most likely agree upon?
As the number of shared features increases so does the
likelihood of independent evolutio
