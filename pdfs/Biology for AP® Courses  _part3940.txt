mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and
esophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts.
The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more
importantly so that it does not attack “self.” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response
to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance. Immune tolerance is crucial
for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that APCs
of the oral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter. Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs
in the liver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of
regulatory T (Treg) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory
immune factors. The combined r
