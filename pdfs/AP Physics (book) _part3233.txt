†The binding energy corresponds not quite to the bottom of the potential-energy curve, but to the
lowest quantum energy state, slightly above the bottom, as shown in Fig. 29–8.

The curve of Fig. 29–9 is much more common than that of Fig. 29–8. The acti-
vation energy often reflects a need to break other bonds, before the one under
discussion can be made. For example, to make water from

molecules must first be broken into H and O atoms by an input of energy; this
is what the activation energy repres
