5. A researcher is interested in studying how biotic and abiotic
factors influence the population of a particular species. Which of
the following experimental designs would most eﬀectively test
whether one abiotic and one biotic factor influenced a
population?
The researcher conducts three experiments. In one, she
manipulates prey density. In a second, she manipulates
population density of the study species. In the third, she
manipulates both prey and study species population density
to examine the e
