from the end of the capillary. Push the plunger in until it reaches the cotton so that any 
excess KOH is removed. 
Step 6 Remove the plunger to add seeds.

Step 7 Add 0.5 mL of germinating seeds to the microrespirometers. Push the plunger 
in to the 1.0 mL mark. This creates a sealed microrespirometer chamber with a 1.0 mL 
volume. 
Step 8 Place three to four washers around the barrel of the microrespirometers. The 
washers provide weight so that the microrespirometers will sink. 
Step 9 Place the microrespirometers in a room temperature (about 20Â°C) water bath. You 
must maintain the temperature of the water bath for the experiment. Adjust the level of 
the water bath so that the capillary tube is sticking out of the water while the barrel of the 
microrespirometers is completely submerged. You will not be able to read the capillary 
tube easily unless it is out of the water. Make sure the top end of the capillary tube is 
open (not sealed).
