Since students learned how to make 
scientific claims in the previous unit, the 
instructional focus of this unit should be 
on gaining proficiency in argumentation 
through supporting claims with evidence. The 
evidence can be from biological principles, 
concepts, processes, and/or data. Students 
should provide reasoning to justify a claim by 
connecting evidence to biological theories.
A key concept in this unit is structure-
function relationships. This should be 
reinforced in context as students proceed 
through the course. It is important that 
students understand rates of enzyme 
reactions and how
