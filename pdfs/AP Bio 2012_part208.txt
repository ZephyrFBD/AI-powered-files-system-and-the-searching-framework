nd 
in transport vesicles for further processing in the Golgi 
apparatus or to other components of the endomembrane 
system. The student may mention that proteins end up 
inside a vacuole or as a digestive enzyme or are stored for 
later use in seed plants. Another possible description is that 
the proteins end up inside the Golgi apparatus. The protein 
will eventually be packed and excreted as a transmembrane 
protein within the cell.
Free ribosome (location and function): 
The student is able to write a coherent paragraph with 
appropriate terminology and elaboration to explain how 
a protein produced on the free ribosome may ultimately 
end up in the cytosol or a vacuole as a structural protein to 
function in the cytoskeleton or as a motor protein in the 
cell. The student may also mention that the proteins in the 
vacuole function as an enzyme that mediates cell processes 
or as a second messenger in a cell signal transduction 
mechanism. Another explanation of the location of a
