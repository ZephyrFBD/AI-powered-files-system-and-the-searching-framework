energy transfer is completely
efficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form.
An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (also known as randomness). The more energy that
is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of
randomness or disorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high disorder and low energy (Figure 6.12). To
better understand entropy, think of a studentâ€™s bedroom. If no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly
become messy. It would exist in a very disordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the system, in the form
of the student doing work and putting everything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order.
This state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a car or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an
ordered state. Left alone, the entropy of the house or
