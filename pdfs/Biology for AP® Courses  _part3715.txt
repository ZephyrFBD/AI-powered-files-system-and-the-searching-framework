 the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other
structures.
The heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. The coronary arteries branch from the aorta
and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown. They diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied
with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium
where the blood will be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit. The heart muscle will die without a steady supply
of blood. Atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques. Because of the size (narrow) of the
coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries. The slowdown
of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known as angina, and
complete blockage of the arteries will cause myocardial infarction:
