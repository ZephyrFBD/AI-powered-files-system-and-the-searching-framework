33. The mechanism of action of many common 
medications involves interfering with the normal 
pathways that cells use to respond to hormone 
signals. Which of the following best describes a 
drug interaction that directly interferes with a 
signal transduction pathway? 
(A) A medication causes the cell to absorb more 
of a particular mineral, eventually poisoning 
the cell. 
(B) A medication enters the target cell and 
inhibits an enzyme that normally 
synthesizes a second messenger. 
(C) A medication enters the target cellâ€™s nucleus 
and acts as a mutagen. 
(D) A medication interrupts the transcription of 
ribosomal RNA genes.
