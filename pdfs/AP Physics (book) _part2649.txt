he light emitted by one lightbulb would have a random
phase with respect to the second bulb, and the screen would be more or less uni-
formly illuminated. Two such sources, whose output waves have phases that bear
no fixed relationship to each other over time, are called incoherent sources.
24–4 The Visible Spectrum and Dispersion
Two of the most important properties of light are readily describable in terms of the
wave theory of light: intensity (or brightness) and color. The intensity of light is the
energy it carries per unit area per unit time, and is related to the square of the ampli-
tude of the wave, as for any wave (see Section 11–9, or Eqs. 22–7 and 22–8). The
color of light is related to the frequency f or wavelength 
of the light. (Recall
Eq. 22–4.) Visible light—that to which our eyes are 
sensitive—consists of frequencies from 
to 
correspond-
ing to wavelengths in air of about 400 nm to 750 nm.† This is the visible spectrum,
and within it lie the different colors from vi
