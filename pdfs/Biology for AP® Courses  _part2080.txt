processes that were still operating.
This was in direct contrast to other scientific thought at the
time, which included well-accepted proposals that
geologic layers were representative of catastrophic events
caused by processes no longer operating in the present
time. Hutton proposed geologic features as the result of
slow and consistent change, such as valleys formed by
rivers wearing through rock. Hutton’s ideas were
incorporated in the work of Charles Lyell, a geologist
working in Darwin’s time. Lyell advocated a principle
called uniformitarianism, the consistency of mechanisms
of change over time. In other words, Lyell argued that the
same geologic processes operating in the present had
operated in the past, and at the same rate.
The ideas of Hutton and Lyell influenced the work of
Charles Darwin. How do Hutton’s and Lyell’s ideas
connect to and provide support for Darwin’s theory of
evolutionary change?

the present also operated
