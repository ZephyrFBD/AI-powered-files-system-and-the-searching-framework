c disease in MFS has
substantially increased the average life expectancy: up to 70 years of
age.
(A)
Increased use of FBN1 genotyping provides more accurate
identification of those with MFS
(B)
Females aﬀected by MFS are able to access prenatal diagnostics and
may elect to abort a fetus with the FBN1 mutation.
(C)
Diagnosis of individuals well into adulthood may indicate that those
with less severe symptoms of MFS are being identified and receiving
appropriate care.
(D)
17. Haploinsuﬀiciency, in diploid organisms, may arise from a de novo or an
inherited loss-of-function mutation in one allele. Marfan syndrome is one
such example of haploinsuﬀiciency. Individuals with and without MFS
have two alleles that encode for the production of fibrillin-1, a protein
responsible for elastic fiber creation and maintenance throughout the
body. Which of the following statements is most in line with the
information provided?
The amount of fibrillin-1 produced by the cells in the people without
MFS is
