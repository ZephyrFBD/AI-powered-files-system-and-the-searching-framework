In Chapter 2 the figures depicting the key experiments that 
led to the discovery of the structure of the atom—Millikan’s Oil 
Drop experiment and Rutherford’s Gold Foil experiment—have 
been enhanced. This is also the first occurrence of the periodic 
table which has been updated throughout the text to reflect the 
acceptance and naming of elements 113 (Nihonium), 115 (Mus-
covium), 117 (Tennessine), and 118 (Oganesson).
Chapter 5 has undergone the most extensive revision 
in the book. Early parts of the chapter have been modified to 
reflect the fact that basic concepts of energy are now introduced 
in Chapter 1. Two new figures have been added. Figure 5.3 quali-
tatively relates electrostatic potential energy to changes in the 
bonding of an ionic solid, while Figure 5.16 provides a real-
world analogy to help students understand the relationship 
between spontaneity and reaction enthalpy. The figure illus-
trating exothermic and endothermic reactions (Figure 5.8) has
