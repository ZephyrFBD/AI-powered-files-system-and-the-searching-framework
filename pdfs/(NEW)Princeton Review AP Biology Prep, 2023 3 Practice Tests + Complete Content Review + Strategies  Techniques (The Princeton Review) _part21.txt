the following could explain this?
(A) The new organisms were hypotonic compared to the tank and they lost water via osmosis.
(B) The new organisms expelled waste products that increased the tank’s osmolality.
(C) The new organism competed with organism 1 for food and caused it to become active.
(D) The new organism ingested large amounts of fluid and the tank fluid level decreased.
Questions 6–9 refer to the following passage.
The active site of the enzyme Ritzolinine (RZN45) contains three positively charged lysine
residues. When ascorbic acid is present, binding of JB-76, the substrate of RZN45, decreases. The
reaction rate is affected by the presence of ascorbic acid as shown in the figure below. It is
thought that a daily supplement of Vitamin C might aid those suffering from Ritzolierre’s
Disease, which is caused by elevated levels of RZN45.

6. Which of the following is likely true?
(A) RZN45 and JB-76 have similarly charged amino aci
