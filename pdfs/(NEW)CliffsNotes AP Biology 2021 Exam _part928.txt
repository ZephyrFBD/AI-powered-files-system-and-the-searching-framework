e antibiotic tetracycline.
To determine the success of the procedure, she prepares two batches of bacteria: one with untreated bacteria, the
other with bacteria that have been treated with the recombinant gene. She also prepares two kinds of agar plates: one
with tetracycline and one without. She transfers the two kinds of bacteria to the two kinds of agar plates.
The results of the experiment are shown here, with the number of bacterial colonies indicated.
 
Use the following answer choices for questions 60-63:
A. Only the treated bacteria are resistant to tetracycline.
B. Some untreated bacteria are resistant to tetracycline.
C. Both normal and treated bacteria are able to grow in the absence of
tetracycline.
 
D. Not all treated bacteria absorbed the recombinant plasmid.
60. What does a comparison of results I and II indicate?
61. What does a comparison of results III and IV indicate?
62. Why is the number of colonies on the tetracycline agar for the treated bacteria limited to 15 i
