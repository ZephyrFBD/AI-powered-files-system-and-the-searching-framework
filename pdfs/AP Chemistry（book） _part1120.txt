it is, with the very high melting 
point of 2485 °C.
(b) In compounds, scandium has a 3+ charge, Sc3+, and the oxide 
ion is O2-. Consequently, the formula of scandium oxide is 
Sc2O3. Metal oxides tend to be basic and, therefore, to react 
with acids to form a salt plus water. In this case, the salt is 
scandium nitrate, Sc1NO323:
Sc2O31s2 + 6 HNO31aq2 ¡ 2 Sc1NO3231aq2 + 3 H2O1l2
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Suppose that a metal oxide of formula M2O3 were soluble in 
water. What would be the major product or products of dis-
solving the substance in water?
(a) MH31aq2 + O21g2 
(b) M1s2 + H21g2 + O21g2
(c) M3 +1aq2 + H2O21aq2 
(d) M1OH221aq2
(e) M1OH231aq2
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction be-
tween copper(II) oxide and sulfuric acid.
Even metal oxides that are insoluble in water demonstrate their basicity by reacting 
with acids to form a salt plus water, as illustrated in Figure 7.16:
Metal oxide + acid ¡ salt + water
 
NiO1s2 + 2 HNO31aq2 ¡ Ni1NO
