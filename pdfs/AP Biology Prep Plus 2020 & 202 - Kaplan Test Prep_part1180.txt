evels), so A to C to B to D.
(c) Calculate the transfer eﬀiciency between trophic level D and trophic
level B for the desert ecosystem. Explain why ecosystems rarely have
more than 4 or 5 trophic levels. (2 points maximum)
Calculation/Explanation (1 point each)
Here is one possible response that would earn full credit:
The transfer efficiency is the efficiency of energy transfer from one trophic
level to the next level up. The table shows for desert ecosystem, the amount
of energy at trophic level D and B is 212 and 22, respectively. Energy flows
from D to B. Thus, the transfer efficiency is 22 divided by 212, which is
approximately 0.10 or 10%. Ecosystems rarely have more than 4 of 5 trophic
levels because about 90% of the energy is lost between trophic levels via
respiration and heat. The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states that in every
energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable and
increases entropy.

level D and tro
