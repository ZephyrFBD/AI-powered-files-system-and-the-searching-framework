14. (II) Digital bits on a 12.0-cm diameter audio CD are encoded
along an outward spiraling path that starts at radius
and finishes at radius
The 
distance between the centers of neighboring spiral-
windings is 
(a) Determine the
total length of the spiraling path. [Hint: Imagine “unwinding”
the spiral into a straight path of width 
and note
that the original spiral and the straight path both occupy
the same area.] (b) To read information, a CD player
adjusts the rotation of the CD so that the player’s readout
laser moves along th
