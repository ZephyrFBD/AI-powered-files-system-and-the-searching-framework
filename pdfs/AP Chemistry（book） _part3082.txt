to gas. For (b), we need to analyze Equation 19.19 at equilibrium 
1∆G = 02, and for (c) we can use Equation 19.12 to calculate T 
when ∆G = 0.

Sample Exercise 19.10 
Relating ∆G to a Phase Change at Equilibrium
(b) At equilibrium, ∆G = 0. In any normal boiling-point equilib-
rium, both liquid and vapor are in their standard state of pure 
liquid and vapor at 1 atm (Table 19.2). Consequently, Q = 1, 
ln Q = 0, and ∆G = ∆G 
° for this process. We conclude that 
∆G° = 0 for the equilibrium representing the normal boiling 
point of any liquid. (We would also ﬁnd that ∆G° = 0 for 
the equilibria relevant to normal melting points and normal 
sublimation points.)

When the concentrations of reactants and products are nonstandard, we must calcu-
late Q in order to determine ∆G. We illustrate how this is done in Sample Exercise 19.11.
