has not occurred, because the
frequency of the heterozygotes is different 5
years later as in the original population.
c.
Evolution has not occurred, because the
frequency of the heterozygotes is the same 5
years later as in the original population.
d.
Evolution has occurred, because the frequency
of the heterozygotes is different 5 years later
compared with the original population.
34. Heterozygote advantage is a condition in which
heterozygotes are favored by natural selection. How would
the value of 2pq likely change if the population was
undergoing heterozygote advantage?
a.
It would remain in equilibrium because the value
of p and q would remain the same.
b.
It would remain in equilibrium because the value
of 2pq would remain the same.
c.
It would not remain in equilibrium because the
value of 2pq would likely increase.
d.
It would not remain in equilibrium because the
value of 2pq would likely decrease.
35. The graph below shows the change in gene frequency
of the two alleles of
