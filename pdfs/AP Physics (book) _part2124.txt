Voltage reading vs. true voltage. An electronic circuit has
two 
resistors,
and 
connected in series, Fig.19–34a. The battery voltage 
is 8.0 V and it has negligible internal resistance. A voltmeter has resistance 
of 
on the 5.0-V scale. What voltage does the meter read when connected
across 
Fig. 19–34b, and what error is caused by the meter’s finite resistance?
APPROACH The meter acts as a resistor in parallel with 
We use parallel
and series resistor analyses and Ohm’s law to find currents and voltages.
SOLUTION The voltmeter resistance of 
is in parallel with 
Fig. 19–34b. The net resistance 
of these two is 
so 
This
is in series with
so the total
resistance is now 
(not the original 
). Hence the current from
the battery is
Then the voltage drop across 
which is the same as that across the voltmeter,
is 
[The voltage drop across 
is
for a total of 8.0 V
.] If we assume the meter is
accurate, it reads 3.5 V. In the original circuit, without the meter,
so the
voltage across 
is
