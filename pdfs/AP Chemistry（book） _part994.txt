â–² Figure 6.31 Outer-shell electron configurations of the elements.
The elements Ni, Pd, and Pt are all in the same group. By examining the electron 
configurations for these elements in Figure 6.31, what can you conclude about the 
relative energies of the nd and 1n + 12s orbitals for this group?
Give It Some Thought
might expect. Similarly, the configuration of copper (element 29) is 3Ar43d104s1 
instead of 3Ar43d94s2.
This anomalous behavior is largely a consequence of the closeness of the 3d and 
4s orbital energies. It frequently occurs when there are enough electrons to form pre-
cisely half-filled sets of degenerate orbitals (as in chromium) or a completely filled 
d subshell (as in copper). There are a few similar cases among the heavier transition 
metals (those with partially filled 4d or 5d orbitals) and among the f-block metals. 
Although these minor departures from the expected are interesting, they are not of 
great chemical significance.
