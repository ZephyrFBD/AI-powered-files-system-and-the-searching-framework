 because it is filled with a highly conductive 
salt solution and uses DC current at a voltage strong enough to cause a small shock. 
Always turn the power supply switch “OFF” and wait 10 seconds before making any 
connection. Connect both supply leads to the power supply (black to black and red to

After use, turn off the power supply, then disconnect both leads from the power supply. 
Remember, power supply on last … and off first. 
■ ALIGNMENT TO THE AP BIOLOGY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK 
This investigation can be conducted during the study of concepts pertaining to the 
storage, retrieval, and transmission of genetic information (big idea 3), with connections 
to evolution (e.g., gene sequencing and measuring genetic variation, which is key to 
natural selection and evolution). As always, it is important to make connections between 
big ideas and enduring understandings, regardless of where in the curr
