roximately 650 skeletal muscles in the human body, each of which is composed of muscle fibers. (The body
also contains specialized smooth and cardiac muscle tissue.) In addition to the collection of organelles typical of eukaryotic
cells, each muscle fiber contains myofibrils, which, in turn, consist of arrangements of protein filaments called actin and
myosin. In the sliding filament model of muscle contraction, the thicker myosin filaments have cross-bridges that attach and
detach to thinner actin filaments. The binding of myosin to actin causes the actin filaments to slide, shortening the muscle
fiber. ATP produced in cellular respiration provides the energy needed for contraction. However, contraction requires a
signal from the nervous system (excitation-contraction coupling).
Nerve impulses traveling down motor neurons cause the release of the acetylcholine from vesicles in the axon terminus
into the synapse between the neuron and the muscle fiber. Acetylcholine binds to receptors
