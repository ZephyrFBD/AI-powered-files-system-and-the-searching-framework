perimental conditions.
An experiment was performed using catalase extracted from potatoes, with varying concentrations of H2O2.
Multiple trials were conducted, and the means and the standard errors of the mean are shown in the following table:
Concentration of H2O2
Mean Time for Disks to Float (seconds)
Standard Error of the Mean (seconds)

1. Which of the following would be a suitable control for this experiment?
(A) changing the temperature of the H2O2 in one of the beakers
(B) changing the solution the paper disk is soaked in from catalase to water in one of the beakers
(C) changing the source of the catalase from potato to liver
(D) changing the pH of the H2O2 in one of the beakers
2. Predict what would happen if the catalase solution was boiled before performing the experiment, and justify
your prediction.
(A) The average time for the disks to float would increase because boiling denatured the enzymes.
(B) The average time for the disks to float
