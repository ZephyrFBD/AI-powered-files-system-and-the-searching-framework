began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years
is far greater than previously predicted by climate models.
Finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water.
Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will
disappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation
mountains—a cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for centuries—will also be jeopardized. This could result
in an overabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh water.
