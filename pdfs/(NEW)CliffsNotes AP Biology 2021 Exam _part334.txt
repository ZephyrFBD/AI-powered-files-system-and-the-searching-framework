C) carrying the amino acid methionine attaches to the mRNA at the start codon
AUG. (You can remember that the start codon is AUG because school often starts in Aug ust.)
3. The large ribosomal subunit attaches to the mRNA with the tRNA (bearing a methionine), occupying the middle
of three binding sites (the P site). The ribosome is now completely assembled with the mRNA and one tRNA.
4. Elongation occurs as additional tRNAs arrive bearing their amino acids. A newly arriving tRNA attaches to the
first binding site (the A site), always with the anticodon of the tRNA appropriately base-pairing with the codon of
the mRNA.
5. The amino acid on the tRNA in the second binding site is transferred to the amino acid on the newly arrived
tRNA in the first binding site. In Figure 9-6, several amino acids of the growing polypeptide chain are transferred
because the figure shows elongation after several tRNAs have delivered amino acids.
6. Translocation occurs as the ribosome moves over one binding
