21. What are the differences between internal receptors
and cell-surface receptors?
a.
Internal receptors bind to ligands that are
hydrophobic and the ligand-receptor complex
directly enters the nucleus, initiating
transcription and translation. Cell surface
receptors bind to hydrophilic ligands and initiate
a signaling cascade that indirectly influences the
making of a functional protein.
