FIGURE 5;12 Race car heading
into a curve. From the tire marks 
we see that most cars experienced a
sufficient friction force to give them
the needed centripetal acceleration
for rounding the curve safely. But,
we also see tire tracks of cars on
which there was not sufficient
force—and which unfortunately 
followed more nearly straight-line
paths.
The banking of curves can redu
