hoice (A) is
incorrect because the 95% confidence interval for the data from Sacramento overlaps with the 95% confidence
interval for the data from Oakville (the upper limit for Sacramento of 19.6 is greater than the lower limit for
Oakville of 15.1). Similarly, the 95% confidence intervals for data from San Rafael and Oak Valley overlap (the
upper limit for San Rafael of 37.3 is greater than the lower limit for Oak Valley of 30.1), so choice (C) is
incorrect. Choice (D) is incorrect because the 95% confidence intervals for data from San Rafael and Oakville
overlap (the upper limit for Oakville of 25.1 is greater than the lower limit for San Rafael of 20.1).
10. (D) The upper limit of a 95% confidence interval is determined by adding two times the standard error of the
mean to the mean of the data set, which is represented by choice (D). The lower limit of the 95% confidence
interval is determined by subtracting two times the standard error of the mean from the mean of the data set.
