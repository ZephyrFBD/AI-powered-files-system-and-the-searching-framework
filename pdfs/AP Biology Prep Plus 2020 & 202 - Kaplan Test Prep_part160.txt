to see an osmosis question in one form or another on the exam. It may be
in the multiple-choice section or it may be a free-response question.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Two key skills of the diﬀusion and osmosis lab are:
A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration than
another solution (think hypo = “below” and hyper = “above”).
The first skill uses experimental methods to obtain results. Even if you
know how osmosis works, it is important to know how to measure it. You
can’t really watch water molecules or sugar and starch molecules move
because they’re too small. In this investigation, you learn how to measure
things you don’t see by observing things you can. To obtain results, the
weight change of a dialysis bag or a piece of potato can be measured. An
indicator color will appear if glucose or starch occurs in a solution. If a
bag or piece of potato increased in weight, it gained water and had a
more negative water potential than (was hypertonic to) the solution it
was placed
