diments. The data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature changes and drivers of climate change: before
the Industrial Era (pre-1780), there were three drivers of climate change that were not related to human activity or
atmospheric gases. The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles. The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight
changes in the Earth’s orbit on Earth’s climate. The length of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000
years. In other words, one could expect to see some predictable changes in the Earth’s climate associated with changes in
the Earth’s orbit at a minimum of every 19,000 years.
The variation in the sun’s intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change. Solar intensity is the amount
of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time. There is a direct relationship between solar intensity and
temperature. As solar intensity increases (or decreases), the Earth’s temperature correspondin
