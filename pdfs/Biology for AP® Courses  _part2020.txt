onse to natural selection based on specific
food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. The seed-eating bird
has a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers
to reach the nectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin’s
finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.
