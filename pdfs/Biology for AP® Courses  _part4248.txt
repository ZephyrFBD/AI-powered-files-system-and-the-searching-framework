Climate and Weather
A common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular region (for
example, a very cool week in June in central Indiana) is evidence of global climate change. However, a cold week in June is
a weather-related event and not a climate-related one. These misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms
climate and weather.
Climate refers to the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area. The climate of a biome is
characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges. Climate does not address the amount of rain that
fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. In contrast, weather
refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. Weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour
cycles. Long-range weather forecasts are available but can be unreliable.
