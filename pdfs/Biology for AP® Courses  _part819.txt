enerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is produced in the process.

Why is the mitochondria considered the powerhouse of the cell?
a.
Glycolysis takes place in mitochondria which extract energy by glucose breakdown for cellular metabolism.
b.
Most of the ATP is produced in mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation.
c.
All the pathways involved in ATP production take place in the mitochondria.
d.
The outer membrane of mitochondria is loaded with proteins involved in electron transfer and ATP synthesis.
Products of the Citric Acid Cycle
Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one
glucose molecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily
contain the most recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually
