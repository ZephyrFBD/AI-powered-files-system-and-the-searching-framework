he building blocks of
biological molecules. This theory is supported by evidence from the Miller-Urey experiment, in which a
model of Earth’s early atmosphere was constructed in a lab, and after a few weeks, amino acids and other
components of biological molecules were found.
2. Another theory is that meteorites may have transported organic molecules (that are needed for life) to Earth.
It is thought that early Earth was bombarded with meteorites. Evidence for this theory includes the
Murchison meteorite (found in Australia in 1969), which contained sugars and over 70 different amino acids.
The common ancestor for all eukaryotic life is thought to have evolved about 2.7 billion years ago. Evidence for
a common ancestor of all eukaryotes includes:
■Membrane-bound organelles in all eukaryotes
■Linear chromosomes in all eukaryotes
■All eukaryotes have genes that contain introns
None of these shared characteristics of all eukaryotes are present in prokaryotes, indicating that there was a
