 21.71  The table to the right gives the number of protons (p) 
and neutrons (n) for four isotopes. (a) Write the sym-
bol for each of the isotopes. (b) Which of the isotopes 
is most likely to be unstable? (c) Which of the isotopes 
involves a magic number of protons and/or neutrons?

 21.72  Radon-222 decays to a stable nucleus by a series of three 
alpha emissions and two beta emissions. What is the stable 
nucleus that is formed?
 21.73  Equation 21.28 is the nuclear reaction responsible for 
much of the helium-4 production in our Sun. How much 
energy is released in this reaction?
 21.74  Chlorine has two stable nuclides, 35Cl and 37Cl. In contrast, 
36Cl is a radioactive nuclide that decays by beta emission. 
(a) What is the product of decay of 36Cl? (b) Based on the 
empirical rules about nuclear stability, explain why the 
nucleus of 36Cl is less stable tha
