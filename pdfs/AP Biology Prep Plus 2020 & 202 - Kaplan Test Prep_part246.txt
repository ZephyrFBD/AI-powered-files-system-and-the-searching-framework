iration is
probably a smaller plant and therefore has less transpiration
under any conditions than the plant that had a larger change.
(B)
The plant that responded dramatically does not normally live
in a dry environment. In contrast, the plant that had a smaller
change in transpiration may be a xerophyte, a plant that is
adapted to a dry environment.
(C)
The plant that responded dramatically is probably from a hot
climate, whereas the plant that responded only slightly is
probably from a cold climate.

Plant Vascular and Leaf Systems
PLANT STRUCTURE
Plants with vascular tissues usually have three types of structures, or
organs: leaves, roots, and branches. The leaves provide most of the
photosynthesis of the plant; the roots provide support in the soil, along
with water and minerals; and the branches hold the leaves up to light
and convey nutrients and water between the leaves and the roots. Each
of these structures can be specialized in many ways.
Plants with taproots have long ro
