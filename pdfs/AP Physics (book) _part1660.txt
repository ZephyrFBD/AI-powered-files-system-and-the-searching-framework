erature, no work can be
obtained from them. With regard to being able to do useful work, order has gone
to disorder in this process.
The same can be said about a falling rock that comes to rest upon striking the
ground. Before hitting the ground, all the kinetic energy of the rock could have
been used to do useful work. But once the rock’s mechanical kinetic energy
becomes thermal energy, doing useful work is no longer possible.
Both these examples illustrate another important aspect of the second law of
thermodynamics:
in any natural process, some energy becomes unavailable to do useful work.
In any process, no energy is ever lost (it is always conserved). Rather, energy becomes
less useful—it can do less useful work. As time goes on, energy is degraded, in a
sense. It goes from more orderly forms (such as mechanical) eventually to the
least orderly form: internal, or thermal, energy. Entropy is a factor here because
the amount of energy that becomes unavailable to do work is proporti
