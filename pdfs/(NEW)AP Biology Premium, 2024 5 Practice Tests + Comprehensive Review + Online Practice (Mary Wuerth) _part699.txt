er disk in distilled water
(C) reducing the temperature of the hydrogen peroxide
(D) pureeing the potatoes with a pH 3 buffer instead of water
14. Based on the data obtained, there is least likely to be a statistically significant difference between which two
concentrations of hydrogen peroxide?
(A) 1% and 3%
(B) 3% and 6%
(C) 6% and 9%
(D) 1% and 6%
15. What is the most likely explanation for the relationship between time for the disk to float and concentration of
hydrogen peroxide?
(A) Higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations generate more heat, causing disks to rise faster.
(B) Increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide changes the active site on the catalase, increasing its
reaction rate.
(C) The increasing levels of oxygen produced in the reaction functioned as an allosteric inhibitor of the
enzyme.
(D) More substrate was available to the enzyme.
16. In a follow-up experiment, the student placed the enzyme in a boiling water bath for one minute before
saturating the paper di
