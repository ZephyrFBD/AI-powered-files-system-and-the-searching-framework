nlarged breasts,
and reduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five X
chromosomes. In all types, every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic
dosage. This can be seen as several Barr bodies in each cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype
(i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in
the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.
Duplications and Deletions
In addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may be duplicated or lost. Duplications
and deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal
segments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French for “cry of the cat”)
is a syndrome associated with nervous system abnor
