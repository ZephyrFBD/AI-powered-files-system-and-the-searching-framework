nd anything dissolved in it) will climb up a thin tube or move
through the spaces of a porous material until it is overcome by gravity. It
is as if each water molecule drags along the one behind it, as well as any
nutrients dissolved in the water. Capillary action plays an important role
in moving nutrients and other metabolites through living things. Plant
roots, for example, take in water from the soil, full of minerals and
dissolved nutrients; capillary action draws the water and its load through
the plant against gravity.
AP EXPERT NOTE
Water expands rather than contracts when it freezes. One
consequence of this is that solid ice floats on liquid water.
Second, the polar nature of water makes it a good solvent. Capillary
action would be a lot less useful if water lacked this property. Fortunately,
water molecules are happy to surround positive and negative ions and
readily dissolve other polar compounds. In addition, hydrogen bonds can
form between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of
