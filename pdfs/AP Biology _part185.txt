s a noncompetitive inhibitor of SDH because it
increased the efficiency of SDH and resulted in a decrease in
the formation of fumarate.
Malonate caused a conformational change in succinate that
increased its efficiency, resulting in an increase in SDH.
Which of the following diagrams most accurately represents the
reaction between malonate and SDH according to what the
researcher discovered?

15. Enzymes are specific. They only bind to specific substrates. Below
are two illustrations, A and B, that show an enzyme binding to a
substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate complex.

Which of the following statements correctly pairs the illustration
with the appropriate explanation of how enzymes and substrates
bind?
Illustration A is correct because it shows that the substrate and
enzyme fit exactly, like a lock and key.
Illustration B is correct because it shows that the sub
