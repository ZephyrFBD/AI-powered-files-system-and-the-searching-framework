 of gasoline measures its 
resistance to knocking when burned in an engine. The octane rating of 
the gasoline in the foreground is 89.

oxidizing agents. Their low chemical reactivity, as noted in Section 24.1, is due primarily 
to the strength and lack of polarity of C ¬C and C ¬H bonds.
Alkanes are not completely inert, however. One of their most commercially import-
ant reactions is combustion in air, which is the basis of their use as fuels. 
 (Section 3.2) 
For example, the complete combustion of ethane proceeds according to this highly exo-
thermic reaction:
 
2 C2H61g2 + 7 O21g2 ¡ 4 CO21g2 + 6 H2O1l2  ∆H ° = -2855 kJ

Hydrocarbons
Because alkanes have only single bonds, they contain the largest possible number of 
hydrogen atoms per carbon atom. As a result, they are called saturated hydrocarbons.
