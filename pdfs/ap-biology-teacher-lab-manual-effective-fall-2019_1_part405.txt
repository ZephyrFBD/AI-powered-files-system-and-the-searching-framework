respirometers are sensitive to changes in gas volume, they are also sensitive to changes 
in temperature and air pressure; thus, you need to use a control respirometer. What 
would be a good control for this procedure? Talk with another student for a minute, and 
come up with at least one possible control you could use. 
As you work through Procedures, think about this question: What factors can affect 
the rate of cellular respiration? In Designing and Conducting Your Investigation, you 
will design and conduct an experiment(s) to investigate at least one of your responses 
to this question or some other question you have. Your exploration will likely generate 
even more questions about cellular respiration. 
The investigation also provides an opportunity for you to apply and review concepts 
that you have studied previously, including the relationship between cell structure and 
function (mitochondria); enzymatic activity; strategies for capture, storage, and use of
