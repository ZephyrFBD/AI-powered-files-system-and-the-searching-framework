s polymerase to stall.
d.
Rho-dependent termination is controlled by rho
protein and the polymerase stalls near the end of
the gene at a run of G nucleotides on the DNA
template. In rho-independent termination, when
the polymerase encounters a region rich in A-T
nucleotides, the mRNA creates a hairpin loop
that causes polymerase to stall.
33. What is the main structure that differentiates between
ρ -dependent and ρ -independent termination in
prokaryotes?
a.
Rho-independent termination involves the
formation of a hairpin.
b.
Rho-dependent termination involves the
formation of a hairpin.
c.
Rho-dependent termination stalls when the
polymerase begins to transcribe a region rich in
A-T nucleotides.
d.
Rho-independent termination stalls when the
polymerase begins to transcribe a region rich in
G nucleotides.
34. Which step in the transcription of eukaryotic RNA
differs the most from its prokaryotic counterpart?
