roteins are ever attached to any receptor embedded in any cell
membrane, you would also find that no such evidence exists. If you were to look for a video
or documented evidence of the intact virus injecting its genetic material into the body of the
cell, reproducing itself and then emerging victorious by budding off the cell membrane, you
would find that no such evidence exists.
The closest thing you would find is electron micrograph pictures of cellular particles, possibly
attached to cell debris, both of which to be seen were stained by heavy metals, a process that
completely distorts their architecture within the living organism. This is like finding bits of
paper stuck to the blown-up bricks, thereby proving the paper emerged by taking pieces of the
bricks on its way out.
The Enders baloney
Cowan describes the ‘Covid’ story as being just as make-believe as
his paper story and he charts back this fantasy to a Nobel Prize
winner called John Enders (1897-1985), an American biomedical
