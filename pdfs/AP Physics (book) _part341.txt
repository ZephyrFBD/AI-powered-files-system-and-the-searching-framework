led the newton (N).
One newton is the force required to impart an acceleration of 
to a 
mass of 1 kg. Thus  
In cgs units, the unit of mass is the gram† (g). The unit of force is the dyne, which
is defined as the net force needed to impart an acceleration of 
to a mass
of 1 g. Thus  
Because  
and  
then  
In the British system, which we rarely use, the unit of force is the pound
(abbreviated lb), where  
The unit of mass is the slug,
which is defined as that mass which will undergo an acceleration of 
when 
a force of 1 lb is applied to it. Thus  
Table 4–1 summarizes the
units in the different systems.
It is very important that only one set of units be used in a given calculation 
or Problem, with the SI being what we almost always use. If the force is given in,
say, newtons, and the mass in grams, then before attempting to solve for the
acceleration in SI units, we must change the mass to kilograms. For example, if the
force is given as 2.0 N along the x axis and the mass is 500 g,
