 
 McCourt, what are you doin’ in your grandmother’s dress? and you 
 
 have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain 
 
 how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for 
 
 all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother’s 
 
 dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was 
 
 brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she 
 
 drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you’ll take off this dress 
 
 as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to 
 
 go through life in your dead grandmother’s dress. 
 
 Now Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the 
 
 cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, 
 
 Mammy,wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard 
 
 in his dead grandmother’s dress.You know that once Kathleen Purcell 
 
 gets a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning
