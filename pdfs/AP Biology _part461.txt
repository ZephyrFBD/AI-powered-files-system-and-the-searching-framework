for chemical reactions. Scientists have tried to mimic this early atmosphere
to determine how the first organic molecules and earliest life developed.
Here is a synopsis of those classic experiments.
A. I. Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane, in the 1920s, hypothesized
separately that under the conditions of early Earth, organic molecules
could form. Without corrosively reactive molecular oxygen present to
react with and degrade them, organic molecules could form and remain.

Chemical experiments have shown that it is possible to form complex organic
molecules from inorganic ones in the absence of life.
Stanley Miller and Harold Urey, in the 1950s, tested the Oparin-
Haldane hypothesis and proved that almost any energy source would have
converted the molecules in the early atmosphere into a variety of organic
molecules, including amino acids. They used electricity to mimic
lightning and UV light that must have been present in great amounts
