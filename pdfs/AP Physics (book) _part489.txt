rce exerted on them,
a force we call the force of gravity. Whenever an object has a force exerted on it,
that force is exerted by some other object. But what exerts the force of gravity?
Every object on the surface of the Earth feels the force of gravity 
and no 
matter where the object is, the force is directed toward the center of the Earth
(Fig. 5–16). Newton concluded that it must be the Earth itself that exerts the
gravitational force on objects at its surface.
According to legend, Newton noticed an apple drop from a tree. He is said to
have been struck with a sudden inspiration: If gravity acts at the tops of trees, and
even at the tops of mountains, then perhaps it acts all the way to the Moon! With
this idea that it is the Earth’s gravity that holds the Moon in its orbit, Newton
developed his great theory of gravitation. But there was controversy at the time.
Many thinkers had trouble accepting the idea of a force “acting at a distance.”
Typical forces act through contact—your
