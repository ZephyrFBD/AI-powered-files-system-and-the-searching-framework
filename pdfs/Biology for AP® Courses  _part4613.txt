A food web is unable to be produced because very less amount of basal energy source is available for
consumers to obtain energy from.
Two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem. A grazing food web (such as the
Lake Ontario food web in Figure 37.6) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base, followed by herbivores
and various carnivores. A detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead
organisms), called decomposers or detritivores. These organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material
back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms. As all ecosystems require
a method to recycle material from dead organisms, most grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web. For
example, in a meadow ecosystem, plants may support a grazing food web of different organi
