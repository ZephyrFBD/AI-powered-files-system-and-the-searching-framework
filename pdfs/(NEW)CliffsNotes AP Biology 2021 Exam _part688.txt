erial for their
source of energy. Each of the following groups represents a trophic level that reflects its main energy source:
1. Primary producers are photoautotrophs that convert sun energy into
chemical energy. They include plants, photosynthetic protists, and cyanobacteria. Primary producers can also be
represented by chemoautotrophs when the sources of energy are inorganic substances.
2. Primary consumers, or herbivores, are heterotrophs that eat the primary producers.
 
3. Secondary consumers, or primary carnivores, are heterotrophs that eat the primary consumers.
 
4. Tertiary consumers, or secondary carnivores, are heterotrophs that eat the secondary consumers.
5. Detritivores are heterotrophs that obtain their energy by consuming dead plants and animals (detritus). The
smallest detritivores, called decomposers, include fungi and bacteria. Other detritivores include nematodes,
earthworms, insects, and scavengers such as crabs, vultures, and jackals.
Chemoautotrophs are the pri
