 the "trunk" of the tree, one can discover that species' ancestors, as
well as where lineages share a common ancestry. In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms.
Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information.
For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the
evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other.
Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these
disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life.” Information is used to organize and
classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics. Data may be collected from
fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combin
