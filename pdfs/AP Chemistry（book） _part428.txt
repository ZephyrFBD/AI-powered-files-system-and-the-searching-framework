▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following samples contains the fewest sodium atoms? 
(a) 1 mol sodium oxide (b) 45 g sodium fluoride  
(c) 50 g sodium chloride (d) 1 mol sodium nitrate
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Without using a calculator, arrange these samples in order 
of increasing numbers of O atoms: 1 mol H2O, 1 mol CO2, 
3 * 1023 molecules of O3.
SOLUTION
Analyze We are given amounts of three substances expressed in 
grams, moles, and number of molecules and asked to arrange the 
samples in order of increasing numbers of C atoms.
Plan To determine the number of C atoms in each sample, we 
must convert 12 g 12C, 1 mol C2H2, and 9 * 1023 molecules CO2 to 
numbers of C atoms. To make these conversions, we use the defi-
nition of mole and Avogadro’s number.
Solve One mole is defined as the amount of matter that 
contains as many units of the matter as there are C atoms
