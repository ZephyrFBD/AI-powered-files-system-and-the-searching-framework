 notice 
where the last actual measurement was made and use their own judgment about the 
extrapolated part. Perhaps the extrapolated part fits quite well with the reader’s own 
experience of this or a similar reaction, and he or she is quite willing to go along with the 
author’s extrapolation. On the other hand, the reader may be interested only in the early 
part of the graph and be indifferent to what the author does with the rest of it. It may 
also be that the reader knows that the graph begins to flatten out after 3 hours and so 
disagrees with the author. The point is that we, the readers, must be aware of what part 
of the graph is extrapolated, that is, predicted, from the shape of the graph up to the time 
when the measurements were stopped. Hence, you must clearly indicate on a line graph 
the points that you actually measured. Regardless of what predictions or conclusions you 
want to make about the graph, you must give the reader the liberty of disagreeing with 
you. Ther
