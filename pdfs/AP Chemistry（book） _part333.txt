SECTION 2.8   
Naming Inorganic Compounds 
69
3. Ionic Compounds
Names of ionic compounds consist of the cation name followed by the anion name:
CaCl2
calcium chloride
Al1NO323
aluminum nitrate
Cu1ClO422
copper(II) perchlorate (or cupric perchlorate)
In the chemical formulas for aluminum nitrate and copper(II) perchlorate, parentheses 
followed by the appropriate subscript are used because the compounds contain two 
or more polyatomic ions.
