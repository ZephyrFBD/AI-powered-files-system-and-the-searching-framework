on islands off
the coast of South America are more similar to species found in South America than to species found in
North America.
■Observations of evolution in current species—When repeatedly exposed to antibiotics, bacteria
populations evolve resistance over time. Mosquito populations have evolved resistance to pesticides like
DDT.

Natural Selection
One of the most important things to remember about evolution is that individuals do not evolve; populations evolve.
Charles Darwin was not the first person to propose that populations evolve, but he was the first to explain a
mechanism for evolution, natural selection, that was supported by evidence for how populations evolve.
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was also an early proponent of the idea that biological evolution occurs. Lamarck’s theory of inheritance of acquired
characteristics emphasized changes to individual organisms during the
