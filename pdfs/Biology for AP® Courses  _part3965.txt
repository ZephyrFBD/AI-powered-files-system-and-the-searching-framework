imultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen
interaction.
Antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes
on different antigens. Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino
acids), it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short
regions. Cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but
to a different antigen.
Cross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been
exposed to or vaccinated against one of them. For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface
structures of various Gram-negative bacteria. Conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that
resemble self
