ency of
each allele is described in the equation below. The allele must be either R or r. Let “p“ represent the frequency of the
R allele and “q“ represent the frequency of the r allele in the population.
p + q = 1
This sum of the frequencies must add up to one. If you know the value of one of the alleles, then you’ll also know
the value of the other allele. This makes sense because Hardy-Weinberg works ONLY for populations with 2 alleles
that have normal dominant-recessive behavior. So, if you know there are only 2 alleles possible and you know that
70% are the dominant allele, then the remaining 30% must be the recessive allele.
We can also determine the frequency of the genotypes in a population using the following equation.
p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
In this equation, p2 represents the homozygous dominants, 2pq represents the heterozygotes, and q2 represents the
homozygous recessives.
Don’t Forget the Heterozygotes!
Remember that the number of individuals with the dominant phenotype
include
