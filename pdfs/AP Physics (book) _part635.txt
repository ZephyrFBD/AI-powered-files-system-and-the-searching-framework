uals
the (reduced) final mechanical energy of the car plus the energy transformed by
friction into thermal energy.
Equations 6–16 can be seen to be Eq. 6–13 modified to include nonconserva-
tive forces such as friction. As such, they are statements of conservation of
energy. When other forms of energy are involved, such as chemical or electrical
energy, the total amount of energy is always found to be conserved. Hence the
law of conservation of energy is believed to be universally valid.

Choosing the system
†The force the spring exerts on the block, and the force the block exerts back on the spring, are not
“external” forces—they are within the system.
