Notice that we have accounted for a total of 18 electrons—6 in the 
three N ¬O s bonds, and 12 as nonbonding pairs on the O atoms. 
The remaining six electrons will reside in the p system of the ion.
The four p orbitals ¬ one on each of the four atoms ¬ are used 
to build the p system. For any one of the three resonance struc-
tures shown, we might imagine a single localized N ¬ O p bond 
formed by the overlap of the p orbital on N and a p orbital on one 
of the O atoms. The remaining two O atoms have nonbonding 
pairs in their p orbitals. Thus, for each of the resonance struc-
tures, we have the situation shown in Figure 9.27. Because each 
resonance structure contributes equally to the observed struc-
ture of NO3
-, however, we represent the p bonding as delocalized 
over the three
