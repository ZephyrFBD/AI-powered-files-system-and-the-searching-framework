sity in the size and shape of neurons throughout the nervous system. Examples include
(a) a pyramidal cell from the cerebral cortex, (b) a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar cortex, and (c) olfactory cells from
the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb.
While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar,
multipolar, and pseudounipolar. Figure 26.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one
structure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they
stimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of
a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and
transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of
neuron. Each multipo
