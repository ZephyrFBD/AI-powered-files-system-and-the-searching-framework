 I overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother 
 
 said I have standing up,North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up 
 
 my First Communion breakfast.Now Grandma says she has God in her 
 
 backyard and what should she do. 
 
 The priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy 
 
 breathing and the choking sounds. 
 
 Ah . . . ah . . . tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little 
 
 water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. 
 
 Say a prayer for me and God bless you,my child. 
 
 Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. 
 
 Grandma said,Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession 
 
 box? If ’tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I’ll 
 
 tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in 
 
  
  
 me backyard? 
 
 He said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. 
 
 Holy water or ordinary water? 
 
 He didn’t say, Grandma. 
 
 Well, go back
