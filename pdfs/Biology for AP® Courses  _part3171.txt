 the supply of
oxygen and nutrients during “fight or flight” or restful
conditions, justify the claim that this broadening
demonstrates that the coordination of events must be
regulated.
E. To stop a beating heart during open-heart surgery a
solution of KCl is injected into the cardiac muscle.
Explain the effect of a large dose of extracellular K+ on
the transmission of the action potential in the sarcolemma.
38. The brain integrates new information through the
formation of memories and by learning. Alternative
explanations of the ability of the brain to remodel in
response to experience, called plasticity, are given. This
item explores those explanations.
Consider the interaction of these three cell types that
integrate information to produce a response to external
cues:

A. Use the figure to construct a representation of the
direction of information flow.
The central body of a neuron is elaborated by tree-like
structures called dendrites. These allow the neuron to
integra
