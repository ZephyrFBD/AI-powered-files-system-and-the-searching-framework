ts about formal charge is true? 
(a) Formal charge is the same as oxidation number. (b) To 
draw the best Lewis structure, you should minimize formal 
charge. (c) Formal charge takes into account the different 
electronegativities of the atoms in a molecule. (d) Formal 
charge is most useful for ionic compounds. (e) Formal charge 
is used in calculating the dipole moment of a diatomic 
molecule.
 8.50 (a) Draw the dominant Lewis structure for the phosphorus 
trifluoride molecule, PF3. (b) Determine the oxidation num-
bers of the P and F atoms. (c) Determine the formal charges 
of the P and F atoms.
 8.51 Write Lewis structures that obey the octet rule for each of the 
following, and assign oxidation numbers and formal charges 
to each atom: (a) OCS, (b) SOCl2 (S is the central atom), 
 
(c) BrO3
