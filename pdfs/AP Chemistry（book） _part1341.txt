 8.64 Draw the Lewis structures for each of the following mole-
cules or ions. Identify instances where the octet rule is not 
obeyed; state which atom in each compound does not follow 
the octet rule; and state how many electrons surround these 
atoms: (a) NO, (b) BF3, (c) ICl2
-, (d) OPBr3 (the P is the cen-
tral atom), (e) XeF4.
 8.65 In the vapor phase, BeCl2 exists as a discrete molecule. 
 
(a) Draw the Lewis structure of this molecule, using only 
single bonds. Does this Lewis structure satisfy the octet 
rule? (b) What other resonance structures are possible 
that satisfy the octet rule? (c) On the basis of the formal 
charges, which Lewis structure is expected to be dominant 
for BeCl2?
 8.66 (a) Describe the molecule xenon trioxide, XeO3, using 
four possible Lewis structures, one each with zero, one, 
two, or three XeÂ¬ O double bonds. (b) Do any of these 
resonance structures satisfy the octet rule for every atom 
in the molecule? (c) Do any of the four Lewis structure
