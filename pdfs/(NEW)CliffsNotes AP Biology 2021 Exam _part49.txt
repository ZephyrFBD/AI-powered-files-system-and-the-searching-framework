ng, a
water molecule is lost. Thus, when glucose and fructose link to form sucrose, the formula is C12H22On (not
C12H24O12) (Figure 2-5). This type of chemical
reaction, where a small molecule is lost, is generally called a condensation reaction (or specifically, a dehydration
reaction, if the lost molecule is water). The reverse reaction, where one molecule is split to form two molecules by
the addition of water, is called hydrolysis. The formation of some common disaccharides with their dehydration
reactions follows:
glucose + fructose = H2O + sucrose (common table sugar)
 glucose + galactose = H2O + lactose (the sugar in milk)
 glucose + glucose = H2O + maltose (a product of the breakdown of starch)
3. A polysaccharide consists of a series of connected monosaccharides. Thus, a polysaccharide is a polymer
because it consists of repeating units of a monosaccharide. The following examples of polysaccharides may contain
thousands of glucose monomers (Figure 2-5):
Starch is a polymer of
