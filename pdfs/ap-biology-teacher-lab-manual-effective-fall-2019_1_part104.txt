cross. 
1. A one locus-three alleles model similar to the ABO blood type inheritance pattern. 
The Punnett squares in Figure 5 and Figure 6 display the results of this model.

2. A two locus-two alleles model (a more typical dihybrid cross). What if the two 
parents were Aabb and aaBb (using a different notation)? If they are crossed, they 
would have generated four genotypes (AaBb, Aabb, aaBb, and aabb) in a one-to-one­
to-one-to-one ratio. 
There is a problem — both hypotheses (1 and 2) can account for the data. How could
