a.
Vestigial structures are the result of convergent
evolution, so they are good evidence that natural
selection act similarly in similar environmental
conditions.
b.
Vestigial structures are the result of common
ancestry, so they are good evidence that different
populations of organisms evolved from a
common point.
c.
Vestigial structures are the result of convergent
evolution, so they are good evidence for an end
goal to evolution.
d.
Vestigial structures are the result of common
ancestry, so they are good evidence for a
common origin of all life.
29. Reproduction in sexually-reproducing organisms

adaptations for reproduction occur in humans, based on
the fact that we are land-based animals.
