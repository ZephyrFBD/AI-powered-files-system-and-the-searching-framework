likely that a common ancestor led to a shared trait in groups f, g, and
h than that the same unusual trait would evolve independently for
group e and for the common ancestor of a and c. (A) is thus correct. (B)
is incorrect because a cladogram shows phylogenetic relationships but
does not necessarily reflect morphological similarities. (C) is incorrect
because cladograms do not represent “progress”; the organisms in
group x were likely just as well adapted to their environment as any of
the later organisms. (D) is incorrect because not all traits are preserved
in the descendants of particular groups.

According to the cladogram, Serpentes and Iguania share a relatively
recent common ancestor (the point labeled Toxicofera), while the
common ancestor between Gekkota and Serpentes is only found at the
first branching of the tree. (A) is thus correct. (B) is incorrect because
Scincidae is monophyletic, deriving not from multiple ancestors but
from a single comm
