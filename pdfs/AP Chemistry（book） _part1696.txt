consumed. After the reac-
tion is complete, the temperature in the flask is 125 °C.  
(a) What is the partial pressure of IF5 in the flask? (b) What 
is the mole fraction of IF5 in the flask (c) Draw the Lewis 
structure of IF5. (d) What is the total mass of reactants and 
products in the flask?

A 6.53-g sample of a mixture of magnesium carbon-
ate and calcium carbonate is treated with excess 
 
hydrochloric acid. The resulting reaction produces 1.72 L 
of carbon dioxide gas at 28 °C and 743 torr pressure. 
 
(a) Write balanced chemical equations for the reactions 
that occur between hydrochloric acid and each compo-
nent of the mixture. (b) Calculate the total number of 
moles of carbon dioxide that forms from these reactions. 
 
(c) Assuming that the reactions are complete, calculate 
the percentage by mass of magnesium carbonate in the 
mixture.
