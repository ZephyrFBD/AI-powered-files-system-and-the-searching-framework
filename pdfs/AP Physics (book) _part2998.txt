 in a toaster. At temperatures above 2000 K, objects glow with
a yellow or whitish color, such as white-hot iron and the filament of a lightbulb.
The light emitted contains a continuous range of wavelengths or frequencies, and
the spectrum is a plot of intensity vs. wavelength or frequency. As the temperature
increases, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects not only increases in
total intensity but has its peak intensity at higher and higher frequencies.
The spectrum of light emitted by a hot dense object is shown in Fig. 27–4 for
an idealized blackbody. A blackbody is a body that, when cool, would absorb all
the radiation falling on it (and so would appear black under reflection when
illuminated by other sources). The radiation such an idealized blackbody would
emit when hot and luminous, called blackbody radiation (though not necessarily
black in color), approximates that from many real objects. The 6000-K curve in
