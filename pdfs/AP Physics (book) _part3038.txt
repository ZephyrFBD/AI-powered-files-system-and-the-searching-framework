In both types, the objective and eyepiece lenses are actually magnetic fields that
exert forces on the electrons to bring them to a focus. The fields are produced by
carefully designed current-carrying coils of wire. Photographs using each type are
shown in Fig. 27–16. EMs measure the intensity of electrons, producing mono-
chromatic photos. Color is often added artificially to highlight.
As discussed in Sections 25–7 and 25–8, the maximum resolution of details
on an object is about the size of the wavelength of the radiation used to view it.
