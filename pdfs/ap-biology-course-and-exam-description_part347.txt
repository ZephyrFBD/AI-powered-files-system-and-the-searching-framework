ed between nonsister chromatids in each 
homologous pair. Thus each chromosome formed and passed on to individual 16 contains DNA from 
both 1 and 2.

(d)
Explain whether the inheritance pattern of the condition is sex-linked or autosomal and dominant  
or recessive.
• The disease phenotype is recessive and is autosomal/not sex-linked. It cannot be dominant because 
individuals 3 and 4 do not have it, but their offspring 14 does. It is not sex-linked because if it was 
Y-linked, all male offspring of males with the disease phenotype would have the trait, and they do not.
