particles, such as electrons, are another matter. Since
the mass m appears in the denominator of Eq. 27–8, a very small mass should
have a much larger wavelength.
Wavelength of an electron. Determine the wavelength
of an electron that has been accelerated through a potential difference of 100 V.
APPROACH If the kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy, we can use
the classical formula,
(see end of Section 26–9). For an electron,
We then apply conservation of energy: the kinetic energy
acquired by the electron equals its loss in potential energy. After solving for v,
we use Eq. 27–8 to find the de Broglie wavelength.
SOLUTION The gain in kinetic energy equals the loss in potential energy:
Thus 
so 
The ratio 
so relativity is not needed. Thus
and
Then
or 0.12 nm.
EXERCISE E As a particle travels faster, does its de Broglie wavelength decrease,
increase, or remain the same?
