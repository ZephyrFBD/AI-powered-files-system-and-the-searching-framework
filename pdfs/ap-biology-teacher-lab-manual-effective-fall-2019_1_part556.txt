lications, it is important to transform as many cells 
as possible. For example, in some forms of gene therapy, cells are collected from the 
patient, transformed in the laboratory, and then put back into the patient. The more cells 
that are transformed to produce the needed protein, the more likely the therapy will 
work. 
Calculating transformation efficiency gives you an indication of how effective you 
were in getting plasmids carrying new information into host bacterial cells. In this 
example, transformation efficiency is a number that represents the total number of 
bacterial cells that express the gene for ampicillin resistance divided by the amount of 
DNA plasmid used in the experiment. The transformation efficiency is calculated using 
the following formula. 
Transformation efficiency = Total number of colonies growing on the agar plate 
Amount of DNA spread on the agar plate (in Î¼g)
