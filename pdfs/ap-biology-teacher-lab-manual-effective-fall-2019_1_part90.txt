uitive to most students to add one mL of media to 9 mL of water to get 
a 1-to-10 dilution. Or, if they compound two successive serial dilutions by adding 10 mL 
to 1 mL, mix, remove a 1 mL aliquot, and then dilute with 10 mL of water, students will 
get a 1-to-121 dilution instead of the 1-to-100 dilution they were anticipating. 
The point is to emphasize that mathematics underlies almost every biological 
experiment performed, even before any analysis of results. Too often, laboratory 
investigations are designed and implemented in a manner where most of these 
preliminary calculations are done for the student. By having the students work through 
these skills, you are laying the foundation for further work.

N = MC/R, where N = estimate of total population size, M = total number of animals captured 
and marked on the first visit, C = total number of animals captured on the second visit, and  
R = number of animals captured on the first visit that were then recaptured on the seco
