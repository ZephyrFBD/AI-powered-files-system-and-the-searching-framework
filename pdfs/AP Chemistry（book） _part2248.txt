action mechanism describes the order in 
which bonds are broken and formed and the changes in relative positions of the atoms 
in the course of the reaction.
Elementary Reactions
We have seen that reactions take place because of collisions between reacting molecules. 
For example, the collisions between molecules of methyl isonitrile 1CH3NC2 can provide 
the energy to allow the CH3NC to rearrange to acetonitrile:
H3C
H3C
H3C
N

Similarly, the reaction of NO and O3 to form NO2 and O2 appears to occur as a result 
of a single collision involving suitably oriented and sufficiently energetic NO and O3 
molecules:
 
NO1g2 + O31g2 ยก NO21g2 + O21g2 
[14.24]
Both reactions occur in a single event or step and are called elementary reactions.
The number of molecules that participate as reactants in an elementary reaction 
defines the molecularity of the reaction. If a single molecule is involved, the reaction 
is unimolecular. The rearrangement of methyl isonitrile is a unimolecular pro
