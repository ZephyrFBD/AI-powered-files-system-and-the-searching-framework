 polymer of glucose,
plant foods with high cellulose content, such as celery, do not
provide many calories when eaten by humans. Which statement
best explains why humans cannot eﬀectively extract energy from
cellulose, despite it being a polymer of glucose?
The glucose monomers in cellulose are connected by
diﬀerent bonds than those in glycogen and starch. Human
digestive enzymes cannot break down these bonds.
(A)
The monomers in glycogen, starch, and cellulose diﬀer
slightly. Humans cannot break down the form of glucose
found in cellulose.
(B)
Cellulose is structured in a way that makes it impossible for
mammals to digest.
(C)
Cellulose is a larger polymer than glycogen and starch, with
more associated water molecules that protect it from
digestion.
(D)
4. Glycogen and triacylglycerols are both used by animals to store
energy. If scientists were examining a sample of storage
molecules, what is the best way to distinguish whether those
molecules consisted of glycogen or triacylglycerol
