role of the helicopter in this example of projectile motion.
Where does the apple land? A child sits
upright in a wagon which is moving to the right at constant speed as shown in
Fig. 3–21. The child extends her hand and throws an apple straight upward
(from her own point of view, Fig. 3–21a), while the wagon continues to travel
forward at constant speed. If air resistance is neglected, will the apple land
(a) behind the wagon, (b) in the wagon, or (c) in front of the wagon?
RESPONSE The child throws the apple straight up from her own reference frame
with initial velocity 
(Fig. 3–21a). But when viewed by someone on the ground,
the apple also has an initial horizontal component of velocity equal to the speed of
the wagon,
Thus, to a person on the ground, the apple will follow the path of
a projectile as shown in Fig. 3–21b. The apple experiences no horizontal accel-
eration, so
