1NO322 and water Figure 4.12 Two. Each O atom becomes an O2- 
ion. Figure 4.13 One, based on the reaction stoichiometry.  
Figure 4.14 Because the Cu(II) ion produces a blue color in aqueous 
solution. Figure 4.18 The volume needed to reach the end point 
if Ba1OH221aq2 were used would be one-half the volume needed for 
titration with NaOH1aq2, because there are two hydroxide ions for 
every barium ion.

Figure 5.2 The electrostatic potential energy of two oppositely 
charged particles is negative (Equation 5.2). As the particles become 
closer, the electrostatic potential energy becomes even more 
negativeâ€”that is, it decreases. Figure 5.3 Attractions between 
oppositely charged ions would cause the ions to move closer 
together reducing the potential energy of the system. The lost 
potential energy is converted to kinetic energy needed to move the 
ions. Figure 5.4 The number of molecules will change because 
three reactant molecules 12 H2 and 1 O22 are needed to make two
