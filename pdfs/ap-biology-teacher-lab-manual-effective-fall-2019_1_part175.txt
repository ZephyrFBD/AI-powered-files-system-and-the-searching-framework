tural crops 
or inadvertent natural selection, such as antibiotic resistance and pesticide resistance. 
Through questioning, focus on the common features of these events: extreme selection, 
rapid changes in populations, and preexisting variation in the population. Use questions 
to help students recognize appropriate quantitative traits in plants that are growing in the 
classroom. Likely youâ€™ll need to ask questions to help students develop an understanding 
of quantitative traits that are polygenic. They usually have little problem coming up with 
a design for a selection experiment once they have an appropriate trait selected. In Fast 
Plants, appropriate traits include number of trichomes, amount of purple anthocyanin, 
and plant height.  
Logistically, the first part of the lab requires quite a bit of coordination and sharing of 
duties among all students in the class. Artificial selection experiments require a relatively 
large population of plants with ample phenotypic variatio
