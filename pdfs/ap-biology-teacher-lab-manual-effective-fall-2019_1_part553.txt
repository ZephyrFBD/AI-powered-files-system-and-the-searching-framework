pensions onto the appropriate 
LB and LB/Amp plates. Be sure to use a separate pipette for each of the four transfers. 
Step 16 Using a new sterile inoculation loop for each plate, spread the suspensions evenly 
around the surface of the agar by quickly “skating” the flat surface of the sterile loop 
back and forth across the plate surface (Figure 3). Do not poke or make gashes in the 
agar! Your teacher might suggest that you use small sterile glass beads to spread the 
suspensions by gently rocking the beads across the surface of the agar. Allow the plates to 
set for 10 minutes.

Step 17 Stack your plates and tape them together. Place the stack upside down in the 37°C 
incubator for 24 hours or as per instructed by your teacher.
