K-selected and r-selected Species
By the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of K- and r-selected species was used extensively and successfully
to study populations. The concept relates not only reproductive strategies, but also to a species’ habitat and behavior,
especially in the way that they obtain resources and care for their young. It includes length of life and survivorship
factors as well. For this analysis, population biologists have grouped species into the two large categories—K-selected and
r-selected—although they are really two ends of a continuum.
K-selected species are species selected by stable, predictable environments. Populations of K-selected species tend to exist
close to their carrying capacity (hence the term K-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. These species have few,
large offspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table B45_04_01). While larger
in size when born, the offspring are relati
