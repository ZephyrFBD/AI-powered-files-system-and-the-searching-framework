r K, to yield an expression that allows us to calcu-
late K if we know the value of ∆G°:
ln K = ∆G°
-RT
K = e-∆G°>RT 
[19.21]
As usual, we must be careful in our choice of units. In Equations 19.20 and 19.21 
we again express ∆G° in kJ>mol. In the equilibrium-constant expression, we use atmo-
spheres for gas pressures, molarities for solutions; and solids, liquids, and solvents do not 
appear in the expression. 
 (Section 15.4) Thus, the equilibrium constant is Kp for gas-
phase reactions and Kc for reactions in solution. 
 (Section 15.2)
From Equation 19.20 we see that if ∆G° is negative, ln K must be positive, which 
means K 7 1. Therefore, the more negative ∆G° is, the larger K is. Conversely, if ∆G° is 
positive, ln K is negative, which means K 6 1. Finally, if ∆G° is zero, K = 1.
Comment We see that ∆G becomes more negative as the pressures 
of N2, H2, and NH3 are changed from 1.0 atm (standard condi-
tions, ∆G°) to 1.0 atm, 3.0 atm, and 0.50 atm, respectively. The
