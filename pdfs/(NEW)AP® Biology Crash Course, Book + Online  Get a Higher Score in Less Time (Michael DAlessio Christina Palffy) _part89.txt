production of RNA
during transcription.
C. DNA replication is a semi-conservative process that produces two new DNA molecules, each of which
consists of one old strand and one newly synthesized complementary strand, and which are checked for
errors by proofreading and repair processes.
II.
Discovery of DNA as the Genetic Material
A. Transformation Experiments of Griffith, Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod.
1. Smooth (contains capsule) living Streptococcus pneumonia injected into a live mouse; it resulted in a
dead mouse.
2. Rough (no capsule) living Streptococcus pneumonia injected into a live mouse; it resulted in a healthy
mouse.
3. Heat-killed smooth (capsule destroyed) Streptococcus pneumonia injected into a live mouse; it
resulted in a healthy mouse.
4. Heat-killed smooth (contains capsule) mixed with living rough (no capsule) Streptococcus pneumonia
injected into a live mouse; it resulted in a dead mouse.
5. Interpretation of the experiment—DNA from the heat-killed smooth cells “transf
