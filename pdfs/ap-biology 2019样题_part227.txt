 grow, and reproduce—
a. Organisms use different strategies to 
regulate body temperature and metabolism.
 i.	 Endotherms use thermal energy 
generated by metabolism to maintain 
homeostatic body temperatures.
ii.	 Ectotherms lack efficient internal 
mechanisms for maintaining body 
temperature, though they may regulate 
their temperature behaviorally by moving 
into the sun or shade or by aggregating 
with other individuals.
b.	
c.	There is a relationship between metabolic 
rate per unit body mass and the size of 
multicellular organisms—generally, the 
smaller the organism, the higher the 
metabolic rate.
d. A net gain in energy results in energy 
storage or the growth of an organism.
e.	A net loss of energy results in loss of mass 
and, ultimately, the death of an organism.
