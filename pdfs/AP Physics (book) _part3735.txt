With 
light-years, the time required for the galaxies to
arrive at their present separations would be approximately (starting with
and using Hubble’s law, Eq. 33–4),
or 14 billion years. The age of the universe calculated in this way is called the
characteristic expansion time or “Hubble age.” It is a very rough estimate and
assumes the rate of expansion of the universe was constant (which today we are
quite sure is not true). Today’s best measurements give the age of the universe as
about 
in remarkable agreement with the rough Hubble age estimate.
Steady-State Model
Before discussing the Big Bang in detail, we mention one alternative to the Big
Bang—the steady-state model—which assumed that the universe is infinitely old
and on average looks the same now as it always has. (This assumed uniformity in
time as well as space was called the perfect cosmological principle.) According to
the steady-state model, no large-scale changes have taken place in the universe
as a whole, particula
