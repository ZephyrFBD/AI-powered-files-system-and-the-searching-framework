ry, there are many axioms and theorems we take for granted, such as that
the sum of the angles of any triangle is 180°. Non-Euclidean geometries, which
involve curved space, have also been imagined by mathematicians. It is hard
enough to imagine three-dimensional curved space, much less curved four-
dimensional space-time. So let us try to understand the idea of curved space by
using two-dimensional surfaces.
Consider, for example, the two-dimensional surface of a sphere. It is clearly
curved, Fig. 33–16, at least to us who view it from the outside—from our three-
dimensional world. But how would hypothetical two-dimensional creatures
determine whether their two-dimensional space was flat (a plane) or curved?
One way would be to measure the sum of the angles of a triangle. If the surface is
a plane, the sum of the angles is 180°, as we learn in plane geometry. But if the
space is curved, and a sufficiently large triangle is constructed, the sum of the
angles will not be 180°. To constr
