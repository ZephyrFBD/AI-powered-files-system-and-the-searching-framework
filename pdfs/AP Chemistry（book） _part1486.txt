Electron domains from nonbonding pairs exert slightly greater 
repulsions than those from bonding pairs, which leads to certain pre-
ferred positions for nonbonding pairs and to the departure of bond 
angles from idealized values. Electron domains from multiple bonds 
exert slightly greater repulsions than those from single bonds. The 
arrangement of electron domains around a central atom is called 
the electron-domain geometry; the arrangement of atoms is called the 
 
molecular geometry.
MOLECULAR POLARITY (SECTION 9.3) The dipole moment of 
a polyatomic molecule depends on the vector sum of the dipole 
moments associated with the individual bonds, called the bond 
 
dipoles. Certain molecular shapes, such as linear AB2 and trigonal pla-
nar AB3, lead to cancellation of the bond dipoles, producing a non-
polar molecule, which is one whose overall dipole moment is zero. In 
other shapes, such as bent AB2 and trigonal pyramidal AB3, the bond 
dipoles do not cancel and the molec
