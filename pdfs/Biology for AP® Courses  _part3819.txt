nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic balance?
•
How do insects use Malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance?
Connection for AP® Courses
The information in this section is not within the scope for AP® other than to appreciate that other organisms, including
microorganisms and invertebrate animals, use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of metabolic waste and
maintain osmotic balance. For example, contractile vacuoles are common in microorganisms; flame cells and nephridia in
certain species and worms, and Malpighian tubules in insects are other examples of excretory systems. Osmoregulation is
vital for all organisms to maintain homeostasis.

Contractile Vacuoles in Microorganisms
The most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. In other words, a cell is the simplest
