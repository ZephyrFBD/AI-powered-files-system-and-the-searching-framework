s have been implicated in certain
forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If
many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed
in cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of
hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa.

Infertility can sometimes be explained by chromosome translocations. Explain how chromosome translocations can
cause infertility. Are there times when a chromosome translocation might not result in infertility?
