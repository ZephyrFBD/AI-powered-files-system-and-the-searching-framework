rait. In pea plants, for example, there is a gene that codes for stem length.
2. An allele is one of several varieties of a gene. In pea plants, there are two alleles of the gene for stem lengthâ€”the
tall allele, which codes for tall plants, and the dwarf allele, which codes for dwarf plants.
3. A locus refers to the location on a chromosome where a gene is located. Every gene has a unique locus on a
particular chromosome.
4. Homologous chromosomes refer to a pair of chromosomes (a homologous pair) that contains the same genetic
information, gene for gene. Each parent contributed one of the chromosomes in the pair (Figure 8-1). At any one
particular locus, the two genes on a pair of homologous chromosomes (a gene pair) might represent two different
alleles for that gene because they originated from different parents. For example, the allele for stem length on one
pea plant chromosome (inherited from one parent) might code for tall plants, whereas the allele on the homologue of
that chro
