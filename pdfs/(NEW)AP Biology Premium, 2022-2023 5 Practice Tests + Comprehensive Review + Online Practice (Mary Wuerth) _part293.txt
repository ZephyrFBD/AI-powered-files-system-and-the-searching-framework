metes would typically each have a haploid number of three.
(c) Two cells would have three chromosomes each, one cell would have four chromosomes, and one cell would
have two chromosomes.
(d) If the nondisjunction event occurred during anaphase II, the result would be as shown in the following
figure because the sister chromatids of the chromosome would not separate. Both chromatids would end up
in the same cell instead of in two separate cells. This would result in an extra chromosome in the cell that
received both chromatids and a missing chromosome in the cell that did not receive either chromatid.
Long Free-Response
13. (a) Genetic recombination occurs during the prophase I stage of meiosis. During prophase I, homologous
chromosomes synapse (pair up) to form tetrads. These tetrads can then exchange genetic information.
(b) The independent variable is exposure to UV light. The dependent variable is the percentage of recombinant
gametes produced.
(c) Cells that were exposed to UV ligh
