apart by the microtubules, which begin to shorten. Each half of a pair of sister chromatids
now moves to opposite poles of the cell. Non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the cell.
Stage 4: Telophase: Two (the cell completes splitting in two)
The final phase of mitosis is telophase. A nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes and the nucleoli
reappear.
The nuclear membrane is ready to divide. Now it’s time to split the cytoplasm in a process known as cytokinesis.
Look at the figure below and you’ll notice that the cell has begun to split along a cleavage furrow (which is
produced by actin microfilaments).
A cell membrane forms around each cell, and the cell splits into two distinct daughter cells. The division of the
cytoplasm yields two daughter cells.
Here’s one thing to remember: cytokinesis occurs differently in plant cells. The cell doesn’t form a cleavage furrow.
Instead, a partition called a cell plate forms down the middle region.
Stage 5: Interphase
Once daughter c
