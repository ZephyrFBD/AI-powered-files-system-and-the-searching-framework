(d) Draw the Lewis dot structures for the three hydro-
carbons. Which of these hydrocarbons possess p bonds? 
Based on their solubilities, would you say p bonds are 
more or less polarizable than s bonds? (e) Explain why 
NO is more soluble in water than either N2 or O2. (f) H2
S is more water-soluble than almost all the other gases 
in table. What intermolecular forces is H2S likely to have 
with water? (g) SO2 is by far the most water-soluble gas 
in table. What intermolecular forces is SO2 likely to have 
with water?

A small cube of lithium 1density = 0.535 g/cm32 measur-
ing 1.0 mm on each edge is added to 0.500 L of water. The 
following reaction occurs:
2 Li1s2 + 2 H2O1l2 ¡ 2 LiOH1aq2 + H21g2
 
 What is the freezing point of the resulting solution, as-
suming that the reaction goes to completion?
