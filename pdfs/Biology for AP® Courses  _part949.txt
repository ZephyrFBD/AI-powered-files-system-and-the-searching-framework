e through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by
the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP
(Figure 8.16). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an
area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.

What role do electrons play in the formation of NADPH?
a.
Electrons from PS I cause the reduction of NADPH to NADP+ .
b.
Electrons from PSII cause the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.
c.
Electrons from PS I cause the reduction of NADP+
to NADPH.
d.
Electrons are gained which causes the oxidation of NADP+ .
