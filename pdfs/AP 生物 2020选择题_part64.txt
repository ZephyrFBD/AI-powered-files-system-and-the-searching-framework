nmental temperature above the optimum 
temperature range of the enzyme. 
(b) Using the template in the space provided for your response, construct an appropriately labeled graph to 
represent the data in Table 1. Determine whether there is a statistical difference in the amount of CO2 fixed by 
rubisco at 30째C and 40째C. 
(c) Based on the data, identify the temperature range at which the soybean leaves are producing the lowest 
amount of carbohydrate. 
(d) Increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are correlated with increased global surface 
temperatures. Based on the data, predict how a surface temperature that continues to rise above 40째C most 
likely affects the amount of energy available to primary consumers in an ecosystem. Provide reasoning to 
justify your prediction. One model predicts that an increase in greenhouse gases will lead to a 째

increase in 
average surface temperature on Earth. Based on the data from the experiment and the prediction of an increase
