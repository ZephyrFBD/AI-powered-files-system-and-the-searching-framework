 answer to one decimal place. Based on your calculations, 
identify the plant life stage at which the insects have the greatest impact on the life cycle of the 
plant. Justify your answer. Describe the most likely interaction between the insects and the plants.

Seed maturation 
Between immature seeds and mature seeds 
Justification (1 point) 
Seed maturation time point is the only one with large difference in the percent remaining 
between treatment groups 
Number of mature seeds remaining in water only treatment is much less than number of 
mature seeds remaining in insecticide spray
