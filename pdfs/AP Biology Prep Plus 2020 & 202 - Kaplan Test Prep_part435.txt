gonic. (C) is incorrect
because cellular respiration consumes glucose to make ATP.

DPIP acts as a substitute for NADP+ in photosynthesis. During
TEST WHAT YOU LEARNED
photosynthesis, DPIP is reduced and becomes colorless, which results
in an increase in light transmittance. According to the data, an increase
in light transmittance over time is found for the tube exposed to light
only, making (C) correct. (A) is incorrect because DPIP changes from
blue to clear when reduced during photosynthesis. (B) is incorrect
because the tube exposed to light only had the highest rate of
photosynthesis (highest percent transmittance). (D) is incorrect
because the solution in all four tubes was blue at time 0.

Aerobic phases of cellular respiration in eukaryotes occur in
mitochondria, which synthesize ATP from ADP. Higher than normal
levels of ADP suggest that the transgenic mice are unable to convert
ADP to ATP as eﬀiciently because the mut
