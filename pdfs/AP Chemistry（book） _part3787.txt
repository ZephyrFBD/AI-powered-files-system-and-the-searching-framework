t form stable +3 ions in the first place). Suggest an 
explanation, keeping in mind the Lewis acid–base nature 
of the metal–ligand bond.
 23.90  Many trace metal ions exist in the blood complexed with 
amino acids or small peptides. The anion of the amino acid 
glycine (gly),
H2NCH2C
O−
O
 
 can act as a bidentate ligand, coordinating to the metal 
through nitrogen and oxygen atoms. How many isomers 
are possible for (a) 3Zn(gly)24 (tetrahedral), (b) 3Pt(gly)24 
(square planar), (c) 3Co(gly)34 (octahedral)? Sketch all pos-
sible isomers. Use the symbol tt to represent the ligand.
 23.91  The coordination complex 3Cr(CO)64 forms colorless, 
diamagnetic crystals that melt at 90 °C. (a) What is the 
oxidation number of chromium in this compound? 
 
(b) Given that 3Cr(CO)64 is diamagnetic, what is the 
electron configuration of chromium in this compound? 
 
(c) Given that 3Cr(CO)64 is colorless, would you expect 
CO to be a weak-field or strong-field ligand? (d) Write the 
name for 3Cr(CO
