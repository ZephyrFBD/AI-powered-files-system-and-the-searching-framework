c plankton, it could either support 20,000 J of
energy to people or to animal plankton. That 20,000 J of animal
plankton in turn could either support 2,000 J of energy to people or to
small fish. That 2000 J of small fish could either support 200 J of
energy to people or to tuna fish. That 200 J of tuna fish could support
20 J of energy to people. As a result, (B), (C), and (D) are not correct.

Increasing the number of photosynthetic plankton would lead to an
increase in energy available at every successive trophic level, making
(D) correct. Removing mercury, as (A) suggests, would make the tuna
healthier, but that action would not necessarily aﬀect the energy
available. Harvesting any organisms from the lower trophic levels
would make less energy available to support tuna fish. Therefore, (B)
and (C) would lead to a decrease in the number of tuna fish that could
be harvested.
