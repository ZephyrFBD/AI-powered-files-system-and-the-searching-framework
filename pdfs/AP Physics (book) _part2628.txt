articles of the medium 
do not travel these distances. In view of this, what can we say about the nature of
light: does light travel as a stream of particles away from its source, or does light
travel in the form of waves that spread outward from the source?
Historically, this question has turned out to be a difficult one. For one thing,
light does not reveal itself in any obvious way as being made up of tiny particles;
nor do we see tiny light waves passing by as we do water waves. The evidence
seemed to favor first one side and then the other until about 1830, when most
physicists had accepted the wave theory. By the end of the nineteenth century,
light was considered to be an electromagnetic wave (Chapter 22). In the early twen-
tieth century, light was shown to have a particle nature as well, as we shall discuss
in Chapter 27. We now speak of the waveâ€“particle duality of light. The wave theory
of light remains valid and has proved very successful. In this Chapter we investi-
