The symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function f is called an 
independent variable.

The symbol that represents a number in the range of f is called a dependent variable. 
So if we write y = f (x), then x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. 
It is helpful to think of a function as a machine. 
 
If x is in the domain of the function f, then when x enters the machine, it is accepted as an 
input and the machine produces an output f (x) according to the rule of the function. 
Another way to picture a function f is by an arrow diagram. 
 
Each arrow associates an input from A to the corresponding output in B.  
 
Example 1 
A function f  is defined by the formula f(x) = x2 +4. 
(a) Express in words how f acts on the input x to produce the output  f (x).
