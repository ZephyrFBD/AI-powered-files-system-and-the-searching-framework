rowth
in each flask lessened after some time, which statement
explains why?
a.
Because the endospores formed 100 years ago,
before the marsh was polluted, they would
evolve resistance to the pollutant fairly quickly.
The bacteria in flask B would then grow more
prolifically, and the difference in population size
of each flask would lessen.
b.
Because the endospores formed 20 years ago
would lose their resistance to the pollutant. The
bacteria in flask A would die, and the difference
in population size of each flask would lessen.
c.
Because the endospores formed 100 years ago,
before the marsh was polluted, they would lose
their resistance to the pollutant. The bacteria in
flask B would then grow more prolifically, and
the difference in population size of each flask
would lessen.
d.
Because the endospores formed 20 years ago
would evolve resistance to the pollutant fairly
quickly. The bacteria in flask A would die, and
the difference in population size of each flask
would lessen.
