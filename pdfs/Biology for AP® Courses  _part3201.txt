Ruffini endings, which are also known as bulbous corpuscles. They are
found in both glabrous and hairy skin. These are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch
and deformations within joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and
movement. Thus, they also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia. Ruffini endings also detect warmth. Note that these

warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors. It is not surprising, then, that humans detect
cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli.
Pacinian corpuscles (seen in Figure 27.7) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are
structurally similar to Meissnerâ€™s corpuscles; they are found in the bone periosteum, joint capsules, pancreas and other
viscera, breast, and genitals. They are rapid
