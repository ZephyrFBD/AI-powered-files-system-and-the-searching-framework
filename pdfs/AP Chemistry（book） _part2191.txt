of these rates are the same.
Table 14.2 shows that changing the initial concentration of either reactant changes 
the initial reaction rate. If we double 3NH4
+4 while holding 3NO2
-4 constant, the rate 
doubles (compare experiments 1 and 2). If we increase 3NH4
+4 by a factor of 4 but 
*Equation 14.4 does not hold true if substances other than C and D are formed in significant 
amounts. For example, sometimes intermediate substances build in concentration before form-
ing the final products. In that case, the relationship between the rate of disappearance of reac-
tants and the rate of appearance of products is not given by Equation 14.4. All reactions whose 
rates we consider in this chapter obey Equation 14.4.
When we speak of the rate of a reaction without specifying a particular reactant or 
product, we utilize the definition in Equation 14.4.*
(a) How is the rate at which ozone disappears related to the rate at which oxygen appears in the reaction 2 O31g2 ยก 3 O21g2?
(b) If the ra
