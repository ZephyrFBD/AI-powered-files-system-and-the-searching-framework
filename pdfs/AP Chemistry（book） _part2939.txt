a liquid. 
 (Section 11.4) Water and carbon dioxide are the two most pop-
ular choices as supercritical fluid solvents. One recently developed industrial process, 
for example, replaces chlorofluorocarbon solvents with liquid or supercritical CO2 in 
the production of polytetrafluoroethylene 13CF2CF24n, sold as Teflon®2. Though CO2 is 
a greenhouse gas, no new CO2 need be manufactured for use as a supercritical fluid 
solvent.
As a further example, para-xylene is oxidized to form terephthalic acid, which is used 
to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic and polyester fiber

This commercial process requires pressurization and a relatively high temperature. Oxy-
gen is the oxidizing agent, and acetic acid 1CH3COOH2 is the solvent. An alternative 
route employs supercritical water as the solvent and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. 
This alternative process h
