re acidic). Thus, the lower plot, representing a more acidic (than normal) blood, corresponds with tissues where
respiration is higher. The lower plot indicates a lower hemoglobin saturation. So this graph supports the hypothesis
that more oxygen is released in tissues where respiration is high.
44. D. Pure water, with no solutes, has a water potential of zero. The presence of solutes in water or in the water of
the potato cells decreases the water potential (makes it more negative). The potato, with central vacuoles filled with
water containing solutes, has a negative water potential.
45. B. Water moves across a selectively permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of
lower water potential. Because pure water has a water potential of zero and the potato has a water potential of less
than zero, water moves into the potato across the plasma membrane. Plasmolysis would only occur if water moved
in the opposite direction, out of the potato cells. When plasmoly
