O2 and eliminates CO2. Without this elaborate series of equilibrium 
shifts and pH changes, the O2 in tissues would be rapidly depleted, 
making further activity impossible. Under such conditions, the buff-
ering capacity of the blood and the exhalation of CO2 through the 
lungs are essential to keep the pH from dropping too low, thereby 
triggering acidosis.

17.3 ∣ Acid–Base Titrations
Titrations are procedures in which one reactant is slowly added into a solution of another 
reactant, while equilibrium concentrations along the way are monitored. 
 (Section 4.6) 
There are two main reasons to do titrations:
t
to determine the concentration of one of the reactants
t to determine the equilibrium constant for the reaction
