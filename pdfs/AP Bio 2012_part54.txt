ry flower is often one of 
the first flowers seen in the spring in some regions 
of the United States. The flower is normally blue, 
but sometimes a white or pink flower variation is 
found. 
  The following data were obtained after several 
crosses.

  Which of the following statements best explains 
the data? 
(A) The appearance of blue in the F1 generation 
of the pink and white cross demonstrates 
that flower color is not an inherited trait but 
is determined by the environment. 
(B) Flower color depends on stages of flower 
development, and young flowers are white, 
advancing to pink and then blue. 
(C) Since the F1 and F2 phenotypes of the pink 
and white cross do not fit the expected 
genotypic and phenotypic ratios, blue-eyed 
Mary must reproduce by vegetative 
propagation. 
(D) Flower color is an inherited trait, and the F1 
and F2
