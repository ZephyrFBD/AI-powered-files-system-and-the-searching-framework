gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage. After activation, they
become inactivated for a brief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.
This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/resting_neuron) discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.
Resting Membrane Potential
A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside
(âˆ’70 mV, note that this number varies by neuron type and by species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential;
it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable
to all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot
simply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in
Table 26.1. The difference in the number of positively charge
