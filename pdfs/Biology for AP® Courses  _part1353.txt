ratios, characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and
considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F2 generation offspring
would be round, and one quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three
quarters of the F2 offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color
are independent events, so we can apply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F2 offspring is

expected to be (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16.
These proportions are identical to those obtained using a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can
also be calculated using the product rule, as each of these genotypes includes o
