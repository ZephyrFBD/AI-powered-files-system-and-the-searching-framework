uilibrium-constant expressions include terms only for reactants and products whose 
concentrations can change during a chemical reaction, the concentrations of pure solids 
and pure liquids are omitted.
The omission can also be rationalized in a second way. Recall from Section 15.2 that 
what is substituted into a thermodynamic equilibrium expression is the activity of each 
substance, which is a ratio of the concentration to a reference value. For a pure substance, 
the reference value is the concentration of the pure substance, so that the activity of any 
pure solid or liquid is always 1.
Give It Some Thought
Write the equilibrium-constant expression for the evaporation of water, 
H2O1l2 ∆ H2O1g2, in terms of partial pressures.
Decomposition of calcium carbonate is another example of a heterogeneous 
reaction:
 
CaCO31s2 ∆ CaO1s2 + CO21g2 
Omitting the concentrations of the solids from the equilibrium-constant expression gives
 
Kc = 3CO24 and Kp = P
CO2 
These equations tell us tha
