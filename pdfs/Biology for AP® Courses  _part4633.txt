Photoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the worldâ€™s
ecosystems. These ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs. Photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the
sun by converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP (and NADP). The energy stored in ATP is used to synthesize
complex organic molecules, such as glucose.
Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in
those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean (Figure 37.9). Many chemoautotrophs
in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy. This
allows chemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies
energy to the rest of the ecosystem.
