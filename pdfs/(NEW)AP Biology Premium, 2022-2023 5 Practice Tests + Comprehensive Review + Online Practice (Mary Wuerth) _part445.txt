hick-walled seeds, while finches with smaller beaks eat thin-walled seeds. During a
drought from 1981 to 1987, the number of plants that produced thin-walled seeds decreased. It was determined that
the average beak size (both length and mass) of finches increased dramatically during the drought.
1. Which type of selection most likely led to the change in beak size during the drought?
(A) directional selection
(B) disruptive selection
(C) stabilizing selection
(D) sexual selection
2. During the years 1988 to 1995, the average beak size of the finches decreased. Which of the following is the
most likely explanation for this change?
(A) Female finches prefer to mate with males with smaller beaks.
(B) The drought ended, and the average rainfall returned to predrought levels.
(C) Predator populations increased.
(D) Finches with larger beaks were more susceptible to diseases.
3. Which of the following would best determine whether two species of birds have a recent common ancestor?
(A) DNA se
