Conservation of linear momentum is another great conservation law of physics.
Collisions, such as between billiard or pool balls, illustrate this law very nicely: the 
total vector momentum just before the collision equals the total vector momentum 
just after the collision. In this photo, the moving cue ball makes a glancing collision with 
the 11 ball which is initially at rest. After the collision, both balls move at angles, but the 
sum of their vector momenta equals the initial vector momentum of the incoming cue ball.
We will consider both elastic collisions (where kinetic energy is also conserved) 
and inelastic
