(shortest line) are the most recently evolved animals. Choice A is
incorrect because, although all of the animals on this phylogenetic
tree are tetrapods, two of the animals (the lungfish and the
amphibians) do not have amnions. Choice C is incorrect because
amphibians and mammals both have digit-bearing limbs, but
lungfish do not. Choice D is incorrect because amphibians do not lay
amniotic eggs; mammals, lizards and snakes, crocodiles, ostriches,
and hawks and other birds do lay amniotic eggs.
(C) These fish clearly exhibited geographic isolation because the
two populations lived in different ponds with different selective
factors. The pressure for selection came from the predatory fish.
After years of being separated, the two fish populations could no
longer mate. Therefore, geographic isolation brought about
reproductive isolation.
(B) Prior to translocation, the greater prairie chickens had become
inbred, diversity had decreased, and fertility had declined. You can
