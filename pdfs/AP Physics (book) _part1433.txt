The time 
between collisions with a wall is very small, so the number of colli-
sions per second is very large. Thus the average force—averaged over many
collisions—will be equal to the momentum change during one collision divided
by the time between collisions (Newton’s second law, Eq. 7–2):
[due to one molecule]
During its passage back and forth across the container, the molecule may collide
with the tops and sides of the container, but this does not alter its x component of
momentum and thus does not alter our result. [It may also collide with other
molecules, which may change its 
However, any loss (or gain) of momentum is
acquired by other molecules, and because we will eventually sum over all the
molecules, this effect will be included. So our result above is not altered.]
The actual force due to one molecule is intermittent, but because a huge num-
ber of molecules are striking the wall per second, the force is,
