ghter noble gases, the bonding 
atomic radii must be estimated because there are no known  
compounds of these elements.
The atomic radii in Figure 7.7 allows us to estimate bond lengths in molecules. For 
example, the bonding atomic radii for C and Cl are 0.76 Å and 1.02 Å, respectively. In CCl4 
the measured length of the C ¬Cl bond is 1.77 Å, very close to the sum 10.76 + 1.02 A

of the bonding atomic radii of Cl and C.

Nuclei cannot get any closer to 
each other due to repulsion 
between core electrons on 
neighboring atoms.

*Remember: The angstrom 11 A
° = 10-10 m2 is a convenient metric unit for atomic measure-
ments of length. It is not an SI unit. The most commonly used SI unit for atomic measurements is 
the picometer 11 pm = 10-12 m; 1 A
° = 100 pm2.
