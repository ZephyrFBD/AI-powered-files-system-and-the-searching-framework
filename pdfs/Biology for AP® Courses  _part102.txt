h each other and the
environment. Then, using similarities and differences among the organisms make a hypothesis about their
relatedness.
Consider the levels of organization of the biological world and create a diagram to place these items in order
from the smallest level of organization to the most encompassing: skin cell, planet Earth, elephant, tropical
rainforest, water molecule, liver, wolf pack, and oxygen atom. Justify the reason why you placed the items
in the hierarchy that you did.
Think About It
Homeostasis—the ability to “stay the same”—is a feature shared by all living organisms. You go for a long
walk on a hot day. Describe how homeostasis keeps your body healthy even though you are sweating
profusely. Then describe an example of an adaptation that evolved in a desert plant or animal that allows
them to survive in extreme temperatures.
Levels of Organization of Living Things
Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a
