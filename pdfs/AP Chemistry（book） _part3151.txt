to part (b)?
design an Experiment
You are measuring the equilibrium constant for a drug candidate 
binding to its DNA target over a series of different temperatures. 
You chose your drug candidate based on computer-aided molecu-
lar modeling, which indicates that the drug molecule likely would 
make many hydrogen bonds and favorable dipole–dipole interac-
tions with the DNA site. You perform a set of experiments in buffer 
solution for the drug–DNA complex and generate a table of K’s at dif-
ferent T’s. (a) Derive an equation that relates equilibrium constant to 
standard enthalpy and entropy changes. (Hint: equilibrium constant, 
enthalpy and entropy are all related to free energy). (b) Show how you 
can graph your K and T data to calculate the standard entropy and 
enthalpy changes for the drug candidate + DNA binding interac-
tion. (c) You are surprised to learn that the e
