horus compounds are those in which the element 
is combined with oxygen. Phosphorus(III) oxide 1P4O62 is obtained by allowing white 
phosphorus to oxidize in a limited supply of oxygen. When oxidation takes place in the 
presence of excess oxygen, phosphorus(V) oxide 1P4O102 forms. This compound is also 
readily formed by oxidation of P4O6. These two oxides represent the two most common 
oxidation states for phosphorus, +3 and +5. The structural relationship between P4O6 
and P4O10 is shown in Figure 22.26. Notice the resemblance these molecules have to the 
P4 molecule (Figure 22.26); all three substances have a P4 core.
Phosphorus(V) oxide is the anhydride of phosphoric acid 1H3PO42, a weak triprotic 
acid. In fact, P4O10 has a very high affinity for water and is consequently used as a dry-
ing agent. Phosphorus(III) oxide is the anhydride of phosphorous acid 1H3PO32, a weak 
diprotic acid (Figure 22.27).*
One characteristic of phosphoric and phosphorous acids is their tendency to
