 7.108  We will see in Chapter 12 that semiconductors are materials 
that conduct electricity better than nonmetals but not as well 
as metals. The only two elements in the periodic table that are 
technologically useful semiconductors are silicon and germa-
nium. Integrated circuits in computer chips today are based on 
silicon. Compound semiconductors are also used in the elec-
tronics industry. Examples are gallium arsenide, GaAs; gallium 
phosphide, GaP; cadmium sulﬁde, CdS; and cadmium selenide, 
CdSe. (a) What is the relationship between the compound 
semiconductors’ compositions and the positions of their ele-
ments on the periodic table relative to Si and Ge? (b) Workers in 
the semiconductor industry refer to “II–VI” and “III–V” materi-
als, using Roman numerals. Can you identify which compound 
semiconductors are II–VI and which are III–V? (c) Suggest other 
compositions of compound semiconductors based on the po
