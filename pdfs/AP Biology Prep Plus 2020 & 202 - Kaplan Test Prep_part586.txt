and increase
metabolic fitness. Otherwise, cells would not be able to obtain enough
resources to stay alive.
GENE REGULATION AND EXPRESSION
Regulatory systems in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes consist of genes
that encode proteins (repressors and activators), which interact with
DNA sequences to control gene expression via negative and positive
control mechanisms. In negative control, genes are expressed until they
are switched oﬀ by a repressor; in positive control, genes are expressed
when they are turned on by an activator. Thus, repressors decrease

14.3 Explain how gene regulation results in gene expression
14.4 Explain how gene expression leads to cell specialization
expression and activators increase expression. Inducers, which bind to
repressors and activators, increase gene expression by disabling
repressors and enabling activators.
Prokaryotic cells generally control gene expression at the transcriptional
level, whil
