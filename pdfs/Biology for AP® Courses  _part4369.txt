ery individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal
chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources,

whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.
In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better
adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition between population members of the same species
for resources is termed intraspecific competition (intra- = “within”; -specific = “species”). Intraspecific competition for
resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity—resources are plentiful and all individuals
can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation
of waste products can red
