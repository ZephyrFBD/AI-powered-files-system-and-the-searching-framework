st metals to undergo 
thermal expansion, which means the volume of the metal 
increases upon heating. How does thermal expansion affect 
the unit cell length? What is the effect of an increase in tem-
perature on the density of a metal?
Metallic Bonding (Section 12.4)
12.49  State whether each sentence is true or false:
(a) Metals have high electrical conductivities because the 
electrons in the metal are delocalized.
(b) Metals have high electrical conductivities because they 
are denser than other solids.
(c) Metals have large thermal conductivities because they 
expand when heated.
(d) Metals have small thermal conductivities because the 
delocalized electrons cannot easily transfer the kinetic 
energy imparted to the metal from heat.
12.50  Imagine that you have a metal bar sitting half in the sun 
and half in the dark. On a sunny day, the part of the metal 
that has been sitting in the sun feels hot. If you touch the 
part of the metal bar that has been sitting in the dark, will
