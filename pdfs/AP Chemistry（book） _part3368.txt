a proton, is accelerated through 
a series of tubes of increasing length. 
The electrical charge on the tubes is 
changed from positive to negative, so 
that the particle is always attracted to 
the tube it is approaching and repelled 
by the one it is leaving. As a result, the 
particle accelerates until it has suffi-
cient kinetic energy to smash into a 
target nucleus. Figure 21.4(b) shows the 
Write the balanced nuclear equation for the process summarized as 27
13Al1n, a224
11Na.
Sample Exercise 21.4 
Writing a Balanced Nuclear Equation
SOLUTION
Analyze We must go from the condensed descriptive form of the 
reaction to the balanced nuclear equation.
Plan We arrive at the balanced equation by writing n and a, each 
with its associated subscripts and superscripts.
Solve The n is the abbreviation for a neutron 11
0n2, and a represents 
an alpha particle 14
2He2. The neutron is the bombarding particle, and 
the alpha particle is a product. Therefore, the nuclear equation is
27
13Al + 1
