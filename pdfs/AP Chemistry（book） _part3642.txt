The importance of transition metals such as iron and cop-
per, is not limited to biology and medicine. Transition metals 
and their alloys are used as structural materials to make coins 
and jewelry, and as electronic conductors in wires and elec-
tronic devices. The presence of partially filled d-orbitals allows 
transition metal compounds to act as catalysts, magnets, and 
pigments. In this chapter, we take a closer look at this fascinat-
ing group of elements.
In earlier chapters, we saw that metal ions can function as 
Lewis acids, forming covalent bonds with molecules and ions 
that act as Lewis bases. 
 (Section 16.11) We have encountered 
many ions and compounds that result from such interactions, 
such as 3Ag(NH3)24+ in 
 Section 17.5 and hemoglobin in 
 
Section 13.6. In this chapter, we focus on the rich and important 
chemistry associated with s
