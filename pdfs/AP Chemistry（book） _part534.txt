 What observation or experimental 
technique would you use to determine the identity of the reaction 
product(s)? Could differences in the physical properties of SO2 and 
SO3 be used to help identify the product(s)? Have any instruments 
been described in Chapters 1–3  that would allow you to identify 
the product(s)? (e) What experiments would you conduct to deter-
mine if the product(s) of this reaction (either SO2 or SO3 or a mix-
ture of the two) can be controlled by varying the ratio of sulfur and 
oxygen that are added to the reaction vessel? What ratio(s) of S to O2 
would you test to answer this question?

◀ WATER IS THE MOST ABUNDANT liquid on our planet. The 
composition of seawater closely matches the composition of the body 
fluids of almost all life forms, suggesting that life arose in the seas.
