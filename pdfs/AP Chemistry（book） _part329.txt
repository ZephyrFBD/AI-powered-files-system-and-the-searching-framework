▲ Figure 2.23 Procedure for naming anions. Here the simple anion and polyatomic oxyanions  
derived from chlorine are used as an example.
Go Figure 
Name the anion obtained by removing one oxygen atom from the 
perbromate ion, BrO4
-.
Figure 2.24 can help you remember the charge and number of oxygen atoms in the 
various oxyanions. Notice that C and N, both period 2 elements, have only three O 
atoms each, whereas the period 3 elements P
, S, and Cl have four O atoms each. Begin-
ning at the lower right in Figure 2.24, note that ionic charge increases from right to left, 
from 1-  for ClO4
- to 3-  for PO4
3-. In the second period the charges also increase from
