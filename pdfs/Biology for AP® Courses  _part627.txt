 inversely proportional to
molecular movement. Greater distance speeds up
the diffusion.
d.
Larger molecules move slower than lighter
molecules. Increasing or decreasing temperature
increases or decreases the energy in the medium,
affecting molecular movement. Density is
inversely proportional to the molecular
movement. Greater distance speeds up the
diffusion.
22. Both of the regular intravenous solutions administered
in medicine, normal saline and lactated Ringerâ€™s solution,
are isotonic. Why is this important?
a.
Isotonic solutions maintain equilibrium and
avoid the exchange of materials to or from the
blood.
b.
Isotonic solutions disrupt equilibrium and allow
better exchange of materials in the blood.
c.
Isotonic solutions increase the pH of blood and
allow better absorption of saline in blood.
d.
Isotonic solutions decrease the pH of the blood
and avoid the exchange of materials to or from
the blood.
23. If a doctor injected a patient with what was labeled as
an isotonic saline so
