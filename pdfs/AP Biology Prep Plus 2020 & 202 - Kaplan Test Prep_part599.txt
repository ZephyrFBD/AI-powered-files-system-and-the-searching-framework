alization because it is expressed at a relatively
constant level throughout the stages shown.
(B)
The abd-A gene is probably the most important for worker
hindlimb specialization because it increases more
dramatically in workers than in queens at the white-eyed
pupa stage.
(C)
The dll gene is probably the most important for worker
hindlimb specialization because its expression dramatically
drops aȇer the L4 stage in workers but drops less in queens.

5. All of the cells shown in the diagram below were produced by
mitosis and cell division from the same individual. Which of the
following best explains how cells with these diverse shapes and
functions resulted?
Each of the diﬀerent types of cells has diﬀerent DNA that
directs the shape the cell takes.
(A)
Each of the diﬀerent types of cells expresses a diﬀerent set of
transcription factors. These turn on the specific genes
necessary in the cell that has them.
(B)
These shapes are random. Cells take the shape of the space
they have.
(C
