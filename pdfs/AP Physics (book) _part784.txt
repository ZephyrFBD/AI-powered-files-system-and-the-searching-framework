he meteor’s kinetic energy was trans-
formed to kinetic energy of the Earth? (c) By how much did
the Earth’s kinetic energy change as a result of this collision?
75. A 28-g bullet strikes and becomes embedded in a 1.35-kg
block of wood placed on a horizontal surface just in front
of the gun. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the
block and the surface is 0.28, and the impact drives the
block a distance of 8.5 m before it comes to rest, what was
the muzzle speed of the bullet?
76. You are the design engineer in charge of the crashworthiness
of new automobile models. Cars are tested by smashing them
into fixed, massive barriers at 
A new model of mass
1500 kg takes 0.15 s from the time of impact until it is brought
to rest. (a) Calculate the average force exerted on the car by
the barrier. (b) Calculate the average deceleration of the car
in g’s.
77. A 0.25-kg skeet (clay target) is fired at an angle of 28° to
the horizontal with a speed of
