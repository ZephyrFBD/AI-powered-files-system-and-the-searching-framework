23. Use a Punnett square to predict the offspring in a cross
between a dwarf pea plant (homozygous recessive) and a
tall pea plant (heterozygous). What is the phenotypic ratio
of the offspring?
a.
1 Tall : 1 dwarf
b.
1 tall : 2 dwarf
c.
3 tall : 1 dwarf
d.
1 dwarf : 4 tall
24. Can a human male be a carrier of red-green color
blindness?
a.
Yes, males can be the carriers of red-green color
blindness, as color blindness is autosomal
dominant.
b.
No, males cannot be the carriers of red-green
color blindness, as color blindness is X-linked.
c.
No, males cannot be the carriers of red-green
color blindness, as color blindness is Y-linked.
d.
Yes, males can be the carriers of red-green color
blindness, as color blindness is autosomal
recessive.
25. Use the probability method to calculate the genotypes
and genotypic proportions of a cross between AABBCc
and Aabbcc parents.
a.
Possible genotypes are AABBcc, AaBbCc,
AaBbcc and the ratio 1 : 2 : 1 .
b.
Possible genotypes are AABbcc,
