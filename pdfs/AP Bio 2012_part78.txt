 6. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) with a wild-type phenotype have gray bodies and red eyes. Certain 
mutations can cause changes to these traits. Mutant flies may have a black body and/or cinnabar eyes. To study 
the genetics of these traits, a researcher crossed a true-breeding wild-type male fly (with gray body and red eyes) 
with a true-breeding female fly with a black body and cinnabar eyes. All of the F1 progeny displayed a wild-type 
phenotype.  
  Female flies from the F1 generation were crossed with true-breeding male flies with black b
