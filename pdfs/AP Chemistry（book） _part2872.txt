cle in the stratosphere is 
responsible for the rise in temperature that reaches its maximum at the strato-
pause (Figure 18.1).
Give It Some Thought
Based on its Lewis structure, which molecule will have stronger oxygen-
oxygen bonds, O2 or O3?
The reactions of the ozone cycle account for some, but not all, of the facts 
about the ozone layer. Many chemical reactions occur that involve substances 
other than oxygen. We must also consider the effects of turbulence and winds 
that mix up the stratosphere. A complicated picture results. The overall result 
of ozone formation and removal reactions, coupled with atmospheric tur-
bulence and other factors, is to produce the upper-atmosphere ozone profile shown in 
 
Figure 18.5, with a maximum ozone concentration occurring at an altitude of about 25 
km. This band of relatively high ozone concentration is referred to as the “ozone layer” 
or the “ozone shield.”
Photons with wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm are energetic enough to
