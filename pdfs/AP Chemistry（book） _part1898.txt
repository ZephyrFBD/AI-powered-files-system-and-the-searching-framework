cell edge, we can cube it to determine its volume.

(a) The crystal structure of rubidium iodide looks just like NaCl 
with Rb+ ions replacing Na+ and I- ions replacing Cl-. From 
the views of the NaCl structure in Figures 12.25 and 12.26, we 
see that there is an anion at each corner of the unit cell and at 
the center of each face. From Table 12.1 we see that the ions 
sitting on the corners are equally shared by eight unit cells  
( 1
8 ion per unit cell), while those ions sitting on the faces are 
equally shared by two unit cells ( 1
2 ion per unit cell). A cube 
has eight corners and six faces, so the total number of I- ions 
is 8 11
82 + 6 11
22 = 4 per unit cell.
(b) Using the same approach for the rubidium cations, we see 
that there is a rubidium ion on each edge and one at the cen-
ter of the unit cell. Using Table 12.1 again, we see that the ions 
sitting on the edges are equally shared by four unit cells (1/4 
ion per unit cell), whereas the cation at the center of the
