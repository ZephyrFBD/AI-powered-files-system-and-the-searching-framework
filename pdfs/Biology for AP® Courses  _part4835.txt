miles east of the coast of Africa, from which it separated
165 million years ago. It is characterized by a large
number of endemic species. What are the main reasons
that Madagascar is a hotspot of endemic biodiversity?
a.
Madagascar has a climate that is more conducive
to evolution than the larger African continent.
b.
Madagascar is close to the tropics of Africa and
consequently has a large number of species.
c.
Madagascar shows species diversity of both
temperate and tropical regions.
d.
Madagascar has been isolated geographically
and species evolved there without interaction
with outside influences.
