erged from the butterfly eggs but died within a few
hours. Repeated attempts at interbreeding have failed.
Which statement best explains why the two populations of grizzled
skipper butterflies cannot produce viable oﬀspring?
The Boundary Waters grizzled skipper males are sterile due to the
founder eﬀect.
(A)
The Boundary Waters grizzled skipper has adapted to its wilderness
home, and any oﬀspring due to interbreeding with the Superior
National Forest population results in progeny unable to survive the
cold weather. 
(B)
The Boundary Waters grizzled skipper is not able to produce viable
oﬀspring because interbreeding with the Superior National Forest
population would increase the frequency of harmful mutations.
(C)
The Boundary Waters grizzled skipper was reproductively isolated
from the Superior National Forest population and has developed
into an incompatible species.
(D)

complicated this relationship. While bermud
