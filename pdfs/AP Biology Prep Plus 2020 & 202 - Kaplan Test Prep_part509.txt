Thermoregulation
Thermoregulation is one aspect of homeostasis that is commonly
featured in the AP Biology exam. The hypothalamus is the brain region
that acts to control the body temperature of an organism that is able to
set its internal temperature. Mammals fall into this category. Hormones
such as adrenaline and the thyroid hormones can increase metabolic
rate and, subsequently, heat production. Muscles can generate heat by
contracting rapidly (shivering). Heat loss is regulated through the
contraction or relaxation of precapillary sphincters. 
Alternative mechanisms are used by some mammals to regulate body
temperature. Panting is a cooling mechanism that results in the
evaporation of water from the respiratory passages. Sweating is also
important in increasing evaporative heat loss so that the body cools. Fur
is used to trap heat, and hibernation during the winter conserves energy
