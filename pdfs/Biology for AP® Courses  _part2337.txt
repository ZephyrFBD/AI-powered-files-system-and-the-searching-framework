 polymerase enzymes
are more likely to make copying errors than DNA polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription. For
this reason, mutations in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This causes them to change and adapt
more rapidly to their host. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include hepatitis C, measles, and rabies.
Virus Classification
To understand the features shared among different groups of viruses, a classification scheme is necessary. As most viruses
are not thought to have evolved from a common ancestor, however, the methods that scientists use to classify living things
are not very useful. Biologists have used several classification systems in the past, based on the morphology and genetics
of the different viruses. However, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, based on which features
of the virus they were using to classify them. The most commonly used classification method today is called the Baltimo
