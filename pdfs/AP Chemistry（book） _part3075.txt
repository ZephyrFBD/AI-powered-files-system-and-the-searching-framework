positive enthalpy term dominates, and ∆G is positive. This positive value of ∆G means 
that ice melting is not spontaneous at T 6 0 °C, just as our everyday experience tells us; 
rather, the reverse process, the freezing of liquid water into ice, is spontaneous at these 
temperatures.
What happens at temperatures greater than 0 °C? As T increases, so does the magni-
tude of -T∆S. When T 7 0 °C, the magnitude of -T∆S is greater than the magnitude of 
∆H, which means that the -T∆S term dominates and ∆G is negative. The negative value 
of ∆G tells us that ice melting is spontaneous at T 7 0 °C.
At the normal melting point of water, T = 0 °C, the two phases are in equilibrium. 
Recall that ∆G = 0 at equilibrium; at T = 0 °C, ∆H and -T∆S are equal in magnitude 
and opposite in sign, so they cancel and give ∆G = 0
