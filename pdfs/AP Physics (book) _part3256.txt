29–5 Bonding in Solids
Quantum mechanics has been a great tool for understanding the structure 
of solids. This active field of research today is called solid-state physics, or
condensed-matter physics so as to include liquids as well. The rest of this Chapter
is devoted to this subject, and we begin with a brief look at the structure of solids
and the bonds that hold them together.
Although some solid materials are amorphous in structure (such as glass), in
that the atoms and molecules show no long-range order, we are interested here
in the large class of crystalline substances whose atoms, ions, or molecules are
generally accepted to form an orderly array known as a lattice. Figure 29–19
shows thre
