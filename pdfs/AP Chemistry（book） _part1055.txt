nces in properties 
arise from the fundamental characteristics 
of atoms, particularly ionization energy. 
Metalloids display properties that are 
intermediate between those of metals and 
those of nonmetals.
 
7.7 ▶ Trends for Group 1A and Group 
2A Metals Examine some periodic trends 
in the chemical and physical properties of 
metals belonging to groups 1A and 2A.
 
7.8 ▶ Trends for Selected Nonmetals  
Investigate some of the periodic trends in 
the chemical and physical properties of 
hydrogen and the elements in groups 6A, 
7A, and 8A.
WHAT’S AHEAD
The periodic table is a powerful 
tool for understanding and predicting the physical 
and chemical properties of elements. Typically, 
elements share common characteristics with 
neighbors that occupy the same column of the 
periodic table. Sodium, potassium, and rubidium 
are soft metals that react violently when they come 
in contact with water. Neon, argon, and krypton are 
colorless, chemically inert gases. Copper, silver, 
and gol
