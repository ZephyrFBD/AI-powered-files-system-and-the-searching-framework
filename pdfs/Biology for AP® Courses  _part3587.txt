ung volumes and capacities are shown. The total lung capacity of the adult male is six liters.
Tidal volume is the volume of air inhaled in a single, normal breath. Inspiratory capacity is the amount of air taken in
during a deep breath, and residual volume is the amount of air left in the lungs after forceful respiration.
