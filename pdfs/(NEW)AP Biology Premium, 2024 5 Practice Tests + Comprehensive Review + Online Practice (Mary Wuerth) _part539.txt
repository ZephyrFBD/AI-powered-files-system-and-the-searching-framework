umed, and
the biomass of the producers (the grass) would most likely increase. The foxes feed on the kangaroo rats, so the
elimination of the kangaroo rats would result in less food for the foxes. In that case, the number of foxes would
likely decrease, not increase, so choice (B) is incorrect. Choice (C) is incorrect because fewer kangaroo rats
would mean more grass for the antelopes, not less. Mountain lions do not eat eagles in this food web, so choice
(D) is incorrect.
3. (B) On average, 90% of the energy at a given trophic level is used in metabolic processes at that level or is lost
as heat and is not transferred to the next trophic level. Choice (A) is incorrect because most nutrients are
transferred to the next trophic level when food is consumed. Decomposers break down dead organic matter,
regardless of the number of trophic levels, so choice (C) is incorrect. The biomass at the producer level must be
larger than the biomass at the primary consumer level, so choice (D) is inco
