g ideas covered in the AP Biology course (this page), as they are
reflected in many free-response questions. Understanding these ideas and being able to articulate them will help
you craft your responses.
Okay, now it’s time for some practice. Take about 25 minutes and try to write a long free-response to the following
question. This is an example of Long Question #2.
The regulation of the expression of gene products is crucial to the development of an embryo and the
maintenance of homeostasis. The table below illustrates the mRNA levels, total protein levels, and total
enzyme activity levels for three different enzymes. These enzymes are encoded by genes A, B, and C after
being expressed in both the absence and presence of “Protein X” or “Protein Y.”
a. Describe differences in maintaining homeostasis in unicellular and multicellular organisms.
b. Construct a graph of the Total Enzyme Levels for each of the 3 genes. Be sure to show the results in the
presence and absence of Protein X a
