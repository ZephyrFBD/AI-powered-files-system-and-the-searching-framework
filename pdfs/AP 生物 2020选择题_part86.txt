D) 
Incorrect. The error bars for the temperature treatments on day 0 
overlap. Therefore, the symbiont density was not statistically greater at 
27°C than it was at 32°C through the entire experiment.

Topic
6.D: Explain the relationship 
between experimental results 
and larger biological concepts, 
processes, or theories.
ENE-1.O: Explain how the 
activities of autotrophs and 
heterotrophs enable the 
flow of energy within an 
ecosystem.
Energy Flow 
through 
Ecosystems
(A) 
Incorrect. The corals are less, not more, photosynthetically active at 
higher temperatures. Even if higher temperatures are a function of more 
sunlight availability, the algae are expelled from the coral and therefore 
not able to provide energy.
(B) 
Incorrect. The corals are less, not more, photosynthetically active at 
higher temperatures. The graphs do not indicate algae efficiency.
(C) 
Correct. The corals and algae have less photosynthetic ability at higher 
temperatur
