dium channel on the surface of a skeletal muscle cell at the neuromuscular
junction. This channel opens in response to acetylcholine, and a massive influx of sodium depolarizes the
muscle cell and causes it to contract.
2. Catalytic (enzyme-linked) receptors have an enzymatic active site on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.
Enzyme activity is initiated by ligand binding at the extracellular surface. The insulin receptor is an example of
an enzyme-linked receptor. After binding insulin, enzymatic activity initiates a complex signaling pathway that
allows the cell to grow, synthesize lipids, and import glucose.
3. A G-protein-linked receptor does not act as an enzyme, but instead will bind a different version of a G-protein
(often GTP or GDP) on the intracellular side when a ligand is bound extracellularly. This causes activation of
secondary messengers within the cell. One important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). It is known as a
“universal hunger signal” because it is the s
