their populations will increase while nonresistant bacteria die out.
This is exactly what is happening today as an increasing number of
populations of pathogenic bacteria, such as the one that causes
tuberculosis, are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is cause for
serious concern in the health community.
The Operon
The operon was discovered in the bacterium E. coli by Jacob and Monod
in the 1940s. Although it is found only in bacteria, it is an important model
of gene regulation. An operon is essentially a set of genes and the
switches that control the expression of those genes. There are two types of
operons: the repressible (tryptophan) operon and the inducible (lac)
operon.
REMEMBER
If a free-response question on the AP exam is about regulation, the operon is a perfect
example.
THE TRYPTOPHAN OPERON
The tryptophan operon consists of a promoter and five adjacent
