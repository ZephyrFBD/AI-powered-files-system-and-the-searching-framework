n bonds between water continually
break and form anew. This allows for the overall temperature to remain stable, although energy is added to the system.
Water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization, which is key to how organisms cool themselves by the evaporation of
sweat. Waterâ€™s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension, whereas its adhesive properties are seen as water
rises inside capillary tubes. The pH value is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is one of many
chemical characteristics that is highly regulated in living organisms through homeostasis. Acids and bases can change pH
values, but buffers tend to moderate the changes they cause. These properties of water are intimately connected to the
biochemical and physical processes performed by living organisms, and life would be very different if these properties
were altered, if it could exist at all.
