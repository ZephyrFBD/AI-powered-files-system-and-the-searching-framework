ons of DNA.
For instance, Jacobsen Syndrome—which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding
defects—is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations,
which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another
chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome.
During Mendel’s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could only be inferred by performing
crosses and observing the traits expressed by offspring. By observing a karyogram, today’s geneticists can
actually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities
in offspring, even before birth.
Disorders in Chromosome Number
Of all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most obviously identifiable from a
karyogram. Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in
th
