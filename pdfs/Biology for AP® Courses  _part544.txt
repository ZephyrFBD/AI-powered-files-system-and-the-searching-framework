y or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these recognition sites on HIV change at a
rapid rate because of mutations, making the production of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult,
as the virus evolves and adapts. A person infected with HIV will quickly develop different populations, or
variants, of the virus that are distinguished by differences in these recognition sites. This rapid change of
surface markers decreases the effectiveness of the personâ€™s immune system in attacking the virus, because
the antibodies will not recognize the new variations of the surface patterns. In the case of HIV, the problem
is compounded by the fact that the virus specifically infects and destroys cells involved in the immune
response, further incapacitating the host.
