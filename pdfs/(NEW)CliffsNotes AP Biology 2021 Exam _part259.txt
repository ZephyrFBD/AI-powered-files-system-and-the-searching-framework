ted in two spaces at the top of
the diagram (t and t in in 3). The gametes of the second parent are represented at the left side (T and t in Figure 8-3).
In the middle are four boxes, each box combining the allele found at the top with the allele found to the left. The
four boxes represent all of the possibilities of combining the two gametes from one parent with the two gametes
from the second parent. In Figure 8-3, the results of the cross Tt × tt are ½ Tt and ½ tt. These results represent the
genotypic frequencies of the offspring. The phenotypic results are ½ tall and ½ dwarf plants. Results can be given as
frequencies (fractions), as percents (½ = 50%), or as ratios. The ratio of dwarf to tall plants is 1:1.
Suppose that you were asked to find the frequencies of the F2generation for
 
the cross TT × tt. Following the procedures above, all of the F1progeny
 
would have the genotype Tt.
 
To find the F2generation, cross the F1offspring with themselves, Tt × Tt
( Figure 8-4). The gen
