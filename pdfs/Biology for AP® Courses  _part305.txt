mensional configurations. Most enzymes are of tertiary configuration. If a
protein is denatured, loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional. Environmental conditions such as
temperature and pH can denature proteins. Some proteins, such as hemoglobin, are formed from several polypeptides, and
the interactions of these subunits form the quaternary structure of proteins.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section, support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in
Big Idea 4 of the AP® Biology Curriculum Framework. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework
provide a transparent foundation for the AP® Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional
activities, and AP® exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more of the seven science
practices.
Big Idea 4
Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions possess complex
properties.
