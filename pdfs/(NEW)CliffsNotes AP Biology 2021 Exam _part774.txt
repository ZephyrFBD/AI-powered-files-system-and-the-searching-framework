Now, the water potential of the sucrose solution and the cell can be calculated using Ψs = −iCRT.
Ψ (potato cell) = Ψs(isotonic solution) = −iCRT Note that the pressure potential (Ψp) of the potato cell is not equal
to zero due to the turgor pressure exerted by the contents of the water on the cell wall. Thus, the individual values of
Ψsand Ψpof the potato cell remain unknown. Only the sum, Ψ, can be determined in this investigation.
In some alternative forms of this investigation, you may not be given any information about the sucrose
concentrations of the four solutions. One way of dealing with this is to mix your own solutions, observe their effects,
and compare them to the unknown solutions. Plotting the weight changes (Ψs. concentrations) for both your
solutions and the unknown solutions together on the same graph will reveal approximations for the unknown
concentrations.
