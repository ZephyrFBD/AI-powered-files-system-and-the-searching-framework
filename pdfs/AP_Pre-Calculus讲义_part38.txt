The domain of a rational function consists of all real numbers x except those for which the 
denominator is zero. 
 
Example 1 
Graph the rational function f(x) =1/x and state the domain and range. 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Asymptotes of Rational Functions 
The line x = a is a vertical asymptote of the function y = f (x) if y approaches ±∞ as x 
approaches a from the right or left. 
 
The line y = b is a horizontal asymptote of the function y = (x) if y approaches b as x 
approaches ± ∞.

To graph more complicated ones, we need to take a closer look at the behavior of a 
rational function near its vertical and horizontal asymptotes. 
In general, if r(x) =P(x) / Q(x) and the degrees of P and Q are the same (both n, say), then 
the horizontal asymptote is 
leading coefficient of
