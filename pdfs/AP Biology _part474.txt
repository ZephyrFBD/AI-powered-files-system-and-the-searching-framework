provides selective pressure from the environment responsible for an

that caused them to become resistant to methicillin.
Changes in the DNA of resistant S. aureus have caused them to
become less resistant.
There is excessive use of antibiotics in humans and animals.
There was a change in the drug methicillin that weakened it.
