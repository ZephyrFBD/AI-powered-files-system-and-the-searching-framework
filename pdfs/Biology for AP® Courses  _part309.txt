dered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its
substrate amylose, a component of starch.
Hormones are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to
control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For
example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level. The primary types and functions of
proteins are listed in Table 3.1.
