 position of a codon will often code for the same amino acid. (This results
from the wobble of the third position of the tRNA anticodon.) The inherited disorder sickle-cell disease is caused by
the replacement of one amino acid by another in two chains of the hemoglobin protein, severely reducing the
effectiveness of hemoglobin in carrying oxygen. However, a frameshift in the mRNA coding for hemoglobin would
certainly make it entirely ineffective.
9. C. In a DNA double helix, thymine base-pairs with adenine. 10. D. During transcription of DNA, the uracil RNA
nucleotide basepairs with the adenine DNA nucleotide.
 
11. C. During transcription of DNA, the adenine RNA nucleotide basepairs with the thymine DNA nucleotide.
 
12. B. Guanine base-pairs with cytosine.
13. D. When base-pairing occurs between the anticodon nucleotides of the tRNA and the codon nucleotides of the
mRNA, a uracil nucleotide base-pairs with an adenine nucleotide.
14. D. This is the same base-pair as in Question 13.
