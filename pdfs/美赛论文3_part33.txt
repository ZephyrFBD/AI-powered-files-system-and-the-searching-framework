4. Model 3: Comprehensive evaluation model
4.1 Data processing
Due to the various types of data we calculate, such as the ‘even time’, the
‘suffering degree’ and the ‘wasting water’, which are all in different quantities and
units, we need a consistent index to evaluate the strategy.
Since all the data is quantitative, we transfer it into index that belongs to [0, 1].
Different data has different influences on the final evaluation. For example, some
factors are positive while some are negative. Considering our three main indexes, they
all have negative impacts on t
