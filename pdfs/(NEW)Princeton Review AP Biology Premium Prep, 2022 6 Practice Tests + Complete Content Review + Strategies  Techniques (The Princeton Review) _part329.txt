The DNA strands are linked by hydrogen bonds. Two hydrogen bonds hold adenine and thymine together, and
three hydrogen bonds hold cytosine and guanine together.
Before we go any further, let’s review the base pairing in DNA:
Adenine pairs up with thymine (A–T or T–A) by forming two hydrogen bonds.
Cytosine pairs up with guanine (G–C or C–G) by forming three hydrogen bonds.
GENOME STRUCTURE
The order of the four base pairs in a DNA strand is the genetic code. Like a special alphabet in our cells, these four
nucleotides spell out thousands of recipes. Each recipe is called a gene. The human genome has around 20,000
genes.
The recipes of the genes are spread out among the millions of nucleotides of DNA, and all of the DNA for a species
is called its genome. Each separate chunk of DNA in a genome is called a chromosome.
Humans have 23 different chromosomes and they have two copies of each, so
each human cell has 46 linear chromosome segments in the nucleus.
Prokaryotes have one circula
