 the G1, S, and G2 phases, which are nearly identical to the phases
preceding mitosis. The G1 phase, which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase and is focused
on cell growth. The S phase is the second phase of interphase, during which the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated.
Finally, the G2 phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell
undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.
During DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies, called sister
chromatids, that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins. Cohesin holds the chromatids together until

anaphase II. The centrosomes, which are the structures that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate.
This prepares the cell to enter prophase I, the first meiotic phase.

Early in prophase I, before
