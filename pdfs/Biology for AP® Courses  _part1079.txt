membrane,
directly influencing gene expression upon
receptor binding.
2. The secretion of hormones by the pituitary gland is an
example of which type of signaling?
a.
autocrine signaling
b.
direct signaling across gap junctions
c.
endocrine signaling
d.
paracrine signaling
3. Why are ion channels necessary to transport ions into or
out of a cell?
a.
Ions are too large to diffuse through the
membrane.
b.
Ions are charged particles and cannot diffuse
through the hydrophobic interior of the
membrane.
c.
Ions bind to hydrophobic molecules within the
ion channels.
d.
Ions bind to carrier proteins in the bloodstream,
which must be removed before transport into the
cell.
4. Why are endocrine signals transmitted more slowly than
paracrine signals?
a.
The ligands are transported through the
bloodstream and travel greater distances.
b.
The target and signaling cells are close together.
c.
The ligands are degraded rapidly.
d.
The ligands do not bind to carrier proteins
during transport.
