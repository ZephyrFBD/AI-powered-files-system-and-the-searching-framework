d sodium chloride, in which the outermost sodium electron is completely trans-
ferred to a chlorine atom (Figure 2.21):

By contrast, molecular hydrogen reacts with chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride 
gas, which consists of HCl molecules:

Hydrogen readily forms molecular compounds with other nonmetals, such as the 
formation of water, H2O1l2; ammonia, NH31g2; and methane, CH41g2. The ability of 
hydrogen to form bonds with carbon is one of the most important aspects of organic 
chemistry, as will see in later chapters.
We have seen that, particularly in the presence of water, hydrogen does readily form 
H+ ions in which the hydrogen atom has lost its electron. 
 (Section 4.3) For example, 
HCl(g) dissolves in H2O to form a solution of hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), in which the
