Eq. 11–6b,
We solve for k:
(b) The total mass is now
We could substi-
tute
into Eq. 11–6b. Instead, we notice that the frequency
decreases with the square root of the mass. Since the new mass is 4/3 times 
the first mass, the frequency changes by a factor of
Thus
NOTE Check this result by direct substitution of k, found in part (a), and the
new mass m into Eq. 11–6b.

ESTIMATE
A vibrating floor. A large motor in a factory
causes the floor to vibrate up and down at a frequency of 10 Hz. The amplitude
of the floor’s motion near the motor is about 3.0 mm. Estimate the maximum
acceleration of the floor near the motor.
APPROACH Assuming the motion of the floor is roughly SHM, we can make
an estimate for the maximum acceleration using
and Eq. 11–6b.
SOLUTION The maximum acceleration occurs when the force
is
largest
