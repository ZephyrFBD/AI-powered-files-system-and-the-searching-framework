First law in isobaric and isovolumetric processes. An
ideal gas is slowly compressed at a constant pressure of 2.0 atm from 10.0 L to
2.0 L. This process is represented in Fig. 15–8 as the path B to D. (In this process,
some heat flows out of the gas and the temperature drops.) Heat is then added to
the gas, holding the volume constant, and the pressure and temperature are
allowed to rise (line DA) until the temperature reaches its original value
In the process BDA, calculate (a) the total work done by the gas, and
(b) the total heat flow into the gas.
APPROACH (a) Work is done only in the compression process BD. In process DA,
the volume is constant so
and no work is done (Eq. 15–3). (b) We use
the first law of thermodynamics, Eq. 15–1.
SOLUTION (a) During the compression BD, the pressure is 
and the work done is
The total work done by the gas is 
where the minus sign means that
of work is done on the gas.
(b) Because the temperature at the beginning and at the end
