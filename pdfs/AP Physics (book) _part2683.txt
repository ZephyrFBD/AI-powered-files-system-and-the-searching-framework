gs will be separated by dark bands which
occur when the path difference BCD in Fig. 24–31a is equal to an integral number
of wavelengths.)
Returning for a moment to Fig. 24–30, the light reflecting at both interfaces,
air–oil and oil–water, each underwent a phase shift of 180° equivalent to a path
difference of
since we assumed
Because the two phase
shifts were equal, they didn’t affect our analysis.
Thin film of air, wedge-shaped. A very fine wire
in diameter is placed between two flat glass plates as in 
Fig. 24–33a. Light whose wavelength in air is 600 nm falls (and is viewed) per-
pendicular to the plates and a series of bright and dark bands is seen, Fig. 24–33b.
How many light and dark bands will there be in this case? Will the area next to
the wire be bright or dark?
APPROACH We need to consider two effects: (1) path differences for rays
reflecting from the two close surfaces (thin wedge of air between the two glass
plates), and (2) the 
phase shift at the lower surface (point E
