Give It Some Thought
If a reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, will the amount of product 
present at equilibrium increase, decrease, or stay the same?
At temperatures near 800 °C, steam passed over hot coke (a form of carbon obtained from coal) reacts to form CO and H2:
C1s2 + H2O1g2 ∆ CO1g2 + H21g2
The mixture of gases that results is an important industrial fuel called water gas. (a) At 800 °C the equilibrium constant for this 
reaction is Kp = 14.1. What are the equilibrium partial pressures of H2O, CO, and H2 in the equilibrium mixture at this tempera-
ture if we start with solid carbon and 0.100 mol of H2O in a 1.00-L vessel? (b) What is the minimum amount of carbon required 
to achieve equilibrium under these conditions? (c) What is t
