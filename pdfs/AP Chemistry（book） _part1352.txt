ormula but different arrangements of atoms. Use Table 8.3 
to estimate ∆H for each of the following gas-phase isomer-
ization reactions and indicate which isomer has the lower 
enthalpy.
 8.98 The Ti2 +  ion is isoelectronic with the Ca atom. (a) Write the 
electron configurations of Ti2 +  and Ca. (b) Calculate the 
number of unpaired electrons for Ca and for Ti2 +. (c) What 
charge would Ti have to be isoelectronic with Ca2 +?
 8.99 (a) Draw the Lewis structure for hydrogen peroxide, H2O2. 
(b) What is the weakest bond in hydrogen peroxide? (c) Hydro-
gen peroxide is sold commercially as an aqueous solution in 
brown bottles to protect it from light. Calculate the longest 
wavelength of light that has sufficient energy to break the 
weakest bond in hydrogen peroxide.
 
 (a) Using formal charges, which of these three resonance 
forms is likely to be the most important? (b) The N ¬ N bond 
length in N2O is 1.12 Å, slightly longer than a typical N ‚ N 
bond; and the N ¬O bond length is
