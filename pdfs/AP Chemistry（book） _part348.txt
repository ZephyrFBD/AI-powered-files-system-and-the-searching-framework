If a multiple-choice question involves a calculation, do the 
calculation, check your work, and only then compare your an-
swer with the choices. Keep in mind, though, that your instruc-

solving a given problem and has probably listed the incorrect 
answers resulting from those errors. Always double-check your 
reasoning and use dimensional analysis to arrive at the correct 
numeric  
answer and the correct units.
In multiple-choice questions that do not involve calcula-
