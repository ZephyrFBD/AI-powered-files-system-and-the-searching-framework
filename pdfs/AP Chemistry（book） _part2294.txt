(e) We first calculate the overall change in energy, ∆H° 
 (Sec-
tion 5.7 and Appendix C), as in
 
∆H° = ∆Hf°1CO21g22 + ∆Hf°1H21g22 - ∆Hf°1HCOOH1g22
 = -393.5 kJ>mol + 0 - 1-378.6 kJ>mol2
 = -14.9 kJ>mol
From this and the given value for Ea, we can draw an approximate 
energy profile for the reaction, in analogy to Figure 14.16.
