om period 5 transition metals to 
period 6. Thus, the period 5 and period 6 transition metals in each group have very similar 
radii and chemical properties. For example, the group 4B metals zirconium (period 5) and 
hafnium (period 6) always occur together in nature and are very difficult to separate.
Electron Configurations and Oxidation States
Transition metals owe their location in the periodic table to the filling of the d subshells, as 
you saw in Figure 6.31. Many of the chemical and physical properties of transition metals 
result from the unique characteristics of the d orbitals. For a given transition-metal atom, 
the valence (n - 1)d orbitals are smaller than the corresponding valence ns and np orbitals. 
In quantum mechanical terms, the (n - 1)d orbital wave functions drop off more rapidly as 
we move away from the nucleus than do the ns and np orbital wave functions. This charac-
teristic feature of the d orbitals limits their interaction with orbitals on neighboring atoms
