e, trumpet, and
pipe organ. We have already seen that the pitch of a pure sound is determined 
by the frequency. Typical frequencies for musical notes on the “equally tempered
chromatic scale” are given in Table 12–3 for the octave beginning with middle C.
Note that one octave corresponds to a doubling of frequency. For example, middle C
has frequency of 262 Hz whereas 
(C above middle C) has twice that frequency,
524 Hz. [Middle C is the C or “do” note at the middle of a piano keyboard.]
