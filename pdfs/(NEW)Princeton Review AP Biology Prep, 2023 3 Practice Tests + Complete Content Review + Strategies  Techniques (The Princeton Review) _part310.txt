in the nucleus, there is also genetic material in
the mitochondria. The mitochondria are always provided by the egg during sexual reproduction, so
mitochondrial inheritance is always through the maternal line, not the male line. In plants the mitochondria are
provided by the ovule and are maternally inherited. Chloroplasts also contain DNA, in the form of one circular
double-stranded molecule. Both chloroplasts and mitochondria assort randomly into daughter cells and gametes.
Pedigrees
One way to study genetic inheritance is by looking at a special family tree called a pedigree. A pedigree shows
which family members have a particular trait and it can help determine if a trait is recessive or dominant and if it is
sex-linked. Traits that skip generations are usually recessive. Traits that appear more in one sex than the other are
usually sex-linked. In a pedigree chart, the males are squares and the females are circles. Matings are drawn with
horizontal lines and the offspring are shown
