Figure 26.18 Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity:
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly
stimulated. This stimulation causes a calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of
more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell,
it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD
occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic
neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase
1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the posts
