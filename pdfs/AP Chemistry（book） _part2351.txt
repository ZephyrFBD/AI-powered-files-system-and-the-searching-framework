[14.113] Platinum nanoparticles of diameter ∼2 nm are import-
ant catalysts in carbon monoxide oxidation to carbon 
dioxide. Platinum crystallizes in a face-centered cubic 
arrangement with an edge length of 3.924 Å. (a) Esti-
mate how many platinum atoms would ﬁt into a 2.0-nm 
sphere; the volume of a sphere is 14>32pr3. Recall that 
1 A
° = 1 * 10-10 m and 1 nm = 1 * 10-9 m. (b) Estimate 
how many platinum atoms are on the surface of a 2.0-nm 
Pt sphere, using the surface area of a sphere 14pr22 and 
assuming that the “footprint” of one Pt atom can be es-
timated from its atomic diameter of 2.8 A
° . (c) U
