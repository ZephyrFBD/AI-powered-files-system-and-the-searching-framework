have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves from animal immune
systems. One way a pathogen escapes our immune system is by changing
how it appears to its potential host. For example, the parasite that causes
African trypanosomiasis (“sleeping sickness”) periodically switches at
random, among 1,000 different versions of the protein that it displays on
its surface. This ability of a pathogen to alter its biochemical appearance is
called antigenic variation.
This antigenic variability is also the reason that the flu (influenza) virus
is a slightly different form every year or every few years. As the flu virus
infects and replicates in one person after another, it undergoes frequent
mutations. The accumulation of these mutations enables the virus to
change its surface proteins, thus making it less vulnerable to our immune
systems.
In addition, the human influenza virus can exchange genes with other
