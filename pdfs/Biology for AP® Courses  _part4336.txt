Demography
While population size and density describe a population at one particular point in time, scientists must use demography to
study the dynamics of a population. Demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death
rates, and life expectancies. Each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics
described above. For example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive
individuals are present. In contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition,
disease, and the accumulation of waste. Similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in
more potential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. Lastly, a female-biased sex ratio
(the ratio of males to females) or age structure (the proportion of population members at specific age
