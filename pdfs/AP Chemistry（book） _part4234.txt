Figure 19.1 Yes, the potential energy of the eggs decreases as 
they fall. Figure 19.2 The freezing of liquid water to form ice is 
exothermic. Figure 19.3 To be truly reversible, the temperature 
change dT must be infinitesimally small. Figure 19.5 Because 
the final volume would be less than twice the volume of Flask A, the 
final pressure would be greater than 0.5 atm. Figure 19.8 There 
are two other independent rotational motions of the H2O molecule:

molecules due to the formation of new bonds. Figure 19.12 Dur-
