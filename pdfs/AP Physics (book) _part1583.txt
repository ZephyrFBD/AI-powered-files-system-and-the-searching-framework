nd the final temperature of the whole system is 53.5°C.
23. (II) Determine the energy content of 100 g of Karen’s fudge
cookies from the following measurements. A 10-g sample
of a cookie is allowed to dry before putting it in a bomb
calorimeter (page 396). The aluminum bomb has a mass of
0.615 kg and is placed in 2.00 kg of water contained in an
aluminum calorimeter cup of mass 0.524 kg. The initial
temperature of the system is 15.0°C, and its temperature
after ignition is 36.0°C.

17. (II) When a 290-g piece of iron at 180°C is placed in a 95-g
aluminum calorimeter cup containing 250 g of glycerin at
10°C, the final temperature is observed to be 38°C. Esti-
mate the specific heat of glycerin.
18. (II) The heat capacity, C, of an object is defined as the amount
of heat needed to raise its temperature by 1 C°. Thus, to
raise the temperature by 
requires heat Q given by
(a) Write the heat capacity C in terms of the specific heat, c,
of the material. (b) What is th
