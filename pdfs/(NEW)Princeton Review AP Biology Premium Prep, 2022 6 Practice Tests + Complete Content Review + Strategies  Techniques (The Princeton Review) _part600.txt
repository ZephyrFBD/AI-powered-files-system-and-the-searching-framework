e species is likely to decrease the biodiversity of the ecosystem.
d. Justify your prediction.
Since invasive species are unlikely to have a natural predator, they will likely increase in number and consume a large
portion of the resources leading to other organisms being unable to consume those numbers and decreasing in number.
Therefore, a greater percentage of the organisms would be made up of the invasive species, while fewer would be made
up of the original species, decreasing the biodiversity.
Question 5
a. Explain how it is possible for a person to have two rare unlinked genetic diseases at the same time.
Everybody has thousands of genes, and it is possible for a person to have mutations in more than one gene. This
causes them to have a phenotype that is the combination of all their genes. If a person has the bad luck to have more
than one mutated gene, then they could have more than one genetic disease at the same time.
b. Calculate the ratios of affected males and affected fem
