rnal environment 
of the cell from the external environment.
ENE-2.C.3
Selective permeability is a direct consequence 
of membrane structure, as described by the 
fluid mosaic model.
ENE-2.C.4
Small nonpolar molecules, includingN_2, O_2 and C O_2O
 freely pass across the membrane. Hydrophilic 
substances, such as large polar molecules and ions, 
move across the membrane through embedded 
channel and transport proteins.
ENE-2.C.5
Polar uncharged molecules, including H2O, 
pass through the membrane in small amounts.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ENE-2
Cells have membranes that allow them to establish and maintain internal 
environments that are different from their external environments.
TOPIC 2.5
Membrane Permeability
ENE-2.D
Describe the role of the 
cell wall in maintaining cell 
structure and function.
ENE-2.D.1
Cell walls provide a structural boundary, as well 
as a permeability barrier for some substances 
to the internal environments.
ENE-2.D.2
Cell walls of plants, prokaryotes, and fung
