16.3 Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation
In eukaryotic cells, the first stage of gene expression control occurs at the epigenetic level. Epigenetic mechanisms control
access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to be turned on or off. These mechanisms control how DNA is packed
into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the DNA is wound around histone proteins. The addition or removal of
chemical modifications (or flags) to histone proteins or DNA signals to the cell to open or close a chromosomal region.
Therefore, eukaryotic cells can control whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to transcription factors and
the binding of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.
16.4 Eukaryotic Transcriptional Gene Regulation
To start transcription, general transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIH, and others, must first bind to the TATA box and
recruit RNA polymerase to that
