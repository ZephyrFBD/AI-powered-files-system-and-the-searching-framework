mnant of this cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human nose. Hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends
of long bones, reducing friction and cushioning the articulations of these bones.
Figure 24.14 Hyaline cartilage consists of a matrix with cells called chondrocytes embedded in it. The chondrocytes
exist in cavities in the matrix called lacunae.
Elastic cartilage has a large amount of elastic fibers, giving it tremendous flexibility. The ears of most vertebrate animals
contain this cartilage as do portions of the larynx, or voice box. Fibrocartilage contains a large amount of collagen fibers,
giving the tissue tremendous strength. Fibrocartilage comprises the intervertebral discs in vertebrate animals. Hyaline
cartilage found in movable joints such as the knee and shoulder becomes damaged as a result of age or trauma. Damaged
hyaline cartilage is replaced by fibrocartilage and results in the joints becoming “stiff.”
