t grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests. The soils of the
temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients. This is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors. As
this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. The leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground,
and provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly, Armadillidium vulgare) and their predators, such
as the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus).
Boreal Forests
The boreal forest, also known as taiga or coniferous forest, is found south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada,
Alaska, Russia, and northern Europe (Figure 35.12). This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The
annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.7â€“39 in) and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs
because of the cold temperatures.
The long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of c
