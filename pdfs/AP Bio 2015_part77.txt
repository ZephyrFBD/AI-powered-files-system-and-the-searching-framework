ntracellular 
levels of iron are higher than in individuals with 
iron-poor diets. Which of the following best 
explains how organisms regulate ferritin protein 
levels in response to available iron? 
(A) Translation of ferritin mRNA is inhibited in 
the presence of iron. 
(B) Translation of ferritin mRNA is stimulated by 
iron. 
(C) Ferritin protein is more stable in the presence 
of iron. 
(D) Ferritin protein is less stable in the presence 
of iron. 
42. 
 The data can best be used to support which of the 
following claims about the mechanism for 
regulating ferritin gene expression? 
(A) Iron increases ribosome binding to ferritin 
mRNA. 
(B) Iron causes the ferritin mRNA to be  
degraded.  
(C) Iron increases the effect of actinomycin D on 
RNA polymerase. 
(D) Iron decreases the ability of ferritin mRNA to 
bind to ribosomes.

 The gene sequences responsible for the iron -
mediated changes in ferritin protein levels are 
highly conserved and are called iron response
