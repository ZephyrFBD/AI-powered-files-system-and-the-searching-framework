t determined in 
part (a)? (c) If the sled slides back down, what is its speed
when it returns to its starting point?
mk = 0.25.
2.3 ms.
79. An airplane pilot fell 370 m after jumping from an aircraft
without his parachute opening. He landed in a snowbank,
creating a crater 1.1 m deep, but survived with only minor
injuries. Assuming the pilot’s mass was 88 kg and his speed
at impact was 
estimate: (a) the work done by the
snow in bringing him to rest; (b) the average force exerted
on him by the snow to stop him; and (c) the work done on
him by air resistance as he fell. Model him as a particle.
80. Many cars have “
bumpers”that are designed
to compress and rebound elastically without any physical
damage at speeds below 
If the material of the
bumpers permanently deforms after a compression of
1.5 cm, but remains like an elastic spring up to that point,
what must be the effective spring constant of the bumper
material, assuming the car has a mass of 1050 kg and is
tested by ramming int
