iosis, the chromosomes line up side-by-side
with their counterparts (homologs). This event is known as synapsis.
Synapsis involves two sets of chromosomes that come together to form a tetrad (a bivalent). A tetrad consists of
four chromatids. Synapsis is followed by crossing-over, the exchange of segments between homologous
chromosomes.
What’s unique in prophase I is that pieces of chromosomes are exchanged between homologous partners. This is one
of the ways organisms produce genetic variation. By the end of prophase I, chromosomes will have exchanged
regions containing several alleles, or different forms of the same gene. This means that each chromosome will have
a different mix of alleles than it began with. Remember, the two homologous chromosomes are versions that came
from the person’s mother and father. So, a chromosome that has experienced crossing-over will now be a mix of
alleles from the mother and father versions.
