omosomes in the oﬀspring,
providing increased genetic diversity in the species.
(A)
It allows for the best genes from each mating type to be
combined into one chromosome, providing increased fitness
in the oﬀspring.
(B)
It enables the mating types to replace regions of DNA that
have been damaged in some way with each others’ normal
DNA.
(C)
It involves the random recombination of DNA , providing
increased genetic diversity among oﬀspring.
(D)
9. A certain type of fungus maintains a commensalistic relationship
with a species of drought-tolerant oak tree known to grow in
northern Nebraska. Recent changes in logging practices in the
area have led many local loggers to cut down many of these oak
trees. In response, the fungi begin to reproduce rapidly, in an
attempt to ensure their continued survival. Which of the following
provides the most likely method of reproduction that the fungi
uses in these circumstances?
Budding, because it allows the fungi to reproduce quickly in
response to the
