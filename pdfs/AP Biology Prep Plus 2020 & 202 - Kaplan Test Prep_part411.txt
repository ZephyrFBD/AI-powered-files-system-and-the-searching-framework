H2 to the phosphorylation of
ADP. The coupling agent for these two processes is a proton gradient
across the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintained by the ETC. As
NADH and FADH2 pass their electrons to the ETC, hydrogen ions (H+) are
pumped out of the matrix, across the inner mitochondrial membrane,
and into the intermembrane space at each of the three protein
complexes. The continuous translocation of H+ creates a positively
charged, acidic environment in the intermembrane space. This
electrochemical gradient generates a proton-motive force, which drives
H+ back across the inner membrane and into the matrix. However, to pass
through the membrane (which is impermeable to ions), the H+ must flow
through specialized channels provided by enzyme complexes called ATP
synthetases. As the H+ pass through the ATP synthetases, enough energy
is released to allow for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The coupling
of the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 with the phosphorylation of ADP is
called oxid
