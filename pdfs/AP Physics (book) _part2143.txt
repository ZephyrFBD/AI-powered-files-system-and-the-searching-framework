he resistance of the wires?
3. (II) What is the internal resistance of a 12.0-V car battery
whose terminal voltage drops to 8.8 V when the starter
motor draws 95 A? What is the resistance of the starter?
19–2 Resistors in Series and Parallel
[In these Problems neglect the internal resistance of a battery
unless the Problem refers to it.]
4. (I) A 
and an 
resistor are connected in series
with a 12-V battery. What is the voltage across the 
resistor?
5. (I) Three 
lightbulbs and three 
lightbulbs are
connected in series. (a) What is the total resistance of the
circuit? (b) What is the total resistance if all six are wired
in parallel?
6. (II) Suppose that you have a 
a 
and a 
resistor. What is (a) the maximum, and (b) the minimum
resistance you can obtain by combining these?
7. (II) How many 
resistors must be connected in series
to give an equivalent resistance to five 
resistors con-
nected in parallel?
8. (II) Design a “voltage divider” (see Example 19–3) that
would provide one-fift
