s, and 
accurately plotting data is equally critical, and students should have many opportunities to practice this 
skill.  
Students should routinely practice analyzing different types of data, both hypothetical and laboratory, to 
identify patterns, connect variables, and perform statistical analysis. Teachers are encouraged to use 
available resources (e.g., AP® Biology Quantitative Skills Guide) to increase their level of comfort with the 
use of statistics in experimental biology. An awareness of the importance of statistics is useful in planning 
experiments and drawing appropriate conclusions based upon the data. Focusing students’ attention on 
how to construct a scientific argument will help them critically analyze data as evidence and provide

Students should practice designing experiments and implementing data collection strategies that address 
scientific questions. Students should practice identi
