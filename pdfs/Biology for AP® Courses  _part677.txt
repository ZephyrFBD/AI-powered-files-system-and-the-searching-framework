and
chemical equilibrium is never reached. In this way, living organisms are in a constant energy-requiring, uphill battle against
equilibrium and entropy. This constant supply of energy ultimately comes from sunlight, which is used to produce nutrients
in the process of photosynthesis.
Figure 6.9 Exergonic and endergonic reactions result in changes in Gibbs free energy. Exergonic reactions release
energy; endergonic reactions require energy to proceed.
Activation Energy
There is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic
reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps.
These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy in the beginning. This small amount of energy
input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy (or free energy of activation) and is
abbreviated EA (Figure 6.10).
