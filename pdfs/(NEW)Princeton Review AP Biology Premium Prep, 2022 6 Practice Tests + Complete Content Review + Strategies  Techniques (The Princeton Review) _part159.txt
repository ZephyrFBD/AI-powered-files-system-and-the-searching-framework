 amino acids.
However, you do have to remember that every amino acid has four important parts around a central carbon: an
amino group (–NH2), a carboxyl group (–COOH), a hydrogen, and an R-group.
Here’s a typical amino acid.
Amino acids differ only in the R-group, which is also called the side chain. The R-group associated with an amino
acid could be as simple as a hydrogen atom (as in the amino acid glycine) or as complex as a charged carbon
skeleton (as in the amino acid arginine).
When it comes to spotting an amino acid, simply keep an eye out for the amino group (NH2); then look for the
carboxyl molecule (COOH). The side chains for each amino acid vary greatly. You don’t have to memorize the
structures of the side chains for individual amino acids, but you should know that they can vary in composition,
polarity, charge, and shape depending on the side chain that they have.
How do the side chains of the amino acids differ?
