ause them to denature—
that is, lose the specific shape they need to function. (See
Section 29–3.) (c) What is the strongest weak bond, and
why? (d) If this bond, and the other weak bonds, were
stronger (that is, too strong), what would be the conse-
quence for protein synthesis?
4. Assume conduction electrons in a semiconductor behave
as an ideal gas. (This is not true for conduction electrons in
a metal.) (a) Taking mass 
and temper-
ature 
determine the de Broglie wavelength of
a semiconductor’s conduction electrons. (b) Given that the
spacing between atoms in a semiconductor’s atomic lattice
is on the order of 0.3 nm, would you expect room-temperature
conduction electrons to travel in straight lines or diffract
when traveling through this lattice? Explain.

5. A strip of silicon 1.6 cm wide and 1.0 mm thick is immersed
in a magnetic field of strength 1.5 T perpendicular to the
strip (Fig. 29–45). When a current of 0.28 mA is run
through the strip, th
