Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions
There are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. These
include the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.
The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. These cells release
the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to increased blood volume. High blood volume causes the cells
to be stretched, resulting in hormone release. ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na+, causing Na+
