s, since potential energy depends only on the vertical height (Eq. 6–6).
There are many interesting examples of the conservation of energy in sports,
such as the pole vault illustrated in Fig. 6–20. We often have to make approxima-
tions, but the sequence of events in broad outline for the pole vault is as follows.
The initial kinetic energy of the running athlete is transformed into elastic 
potential energy of the bending pole and, as the athlete leaves the ground, into
gravitational potential energy. When the vaulter reaches the top and the pole 
has straightened out again, the energy has all been transformed into gravitational
potential energy (if we ignore the vaulter’s low horizontal speed over the bar). The
pole does not supply any energy, but it acts as a device to store energy and thus aid
in the transformation of kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy, which 
is the net result. The energy required to pass over the bar depends on how high the
center of mass (CM) of
