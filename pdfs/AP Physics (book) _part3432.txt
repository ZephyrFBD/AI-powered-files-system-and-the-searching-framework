huge energy-releasing processes of fission and fusion. We also deal with 
the effects of nuclear radiation passing through matter, particularly biological matter,
and how radiation is used medically for therapy, diagnosis, and imaging techniques.

1â€“1 Nuclear Reactions and the
Transmutation of Elements
When a nucleus undergoes 
or 
decay, the daughter nucleus is a different
element from the parent. The transformation of one element into another, called
transmutation, also occurs via nuclear reactions. A nuclear reaction is said to occur
when a nucleus is struck by another nucleus, or by a simpler particle such as a ray,
neutron, or proton, and an interaction takes place. Ernest Rutherford was the first 
to report seeing a nuclear reaction. In 1919 he observed that some of the particles
passing through nitrogen gas were absorbed and protons emitted. He concluded 
that nitrogen nuclei had been transformed into oxygen nuclei via the reaction
where 
is an 
particle, and 
is a proton.
