2 -2 that are in a raindrop that has 
a pH of 5.60, assuming that the sum of all three species in 
the raindrop is 1.0 * 10-5 M.
 17.85  Furoic acid 1HC5H3O32 has a Ka value of 6.76 * 10-4 at 
25 °C. Calculate the pH at 25 °C of (a) a solution formed 
by adding 25.0 g of furoic acid and 30.0 g of sodium furo-
ate 1NaC5H3O32 to enough water to form 0.250 L of solu-
tion, (b) a solution formed by mixing 30.0 mL of 0.250 M 
HC5H3O3 and 20.0 mL of 0.22 M NaC5H3O3 and diluting 
the total volume to 125 mL, (c) a solution prepared by add-
ing 50.0 mL of 1.65 M NaOH solution to 0.500 L of 0.0850 M 
HC5H3O3.
 17.86  The acid–base indicator bromcresol green is a weak acid. 
The yellow acid and blue base forms of the indicator are 
present in equal concentrations in a solution when the pH 
is 4.68. What is the pKa for bromcresol green?
 17.87  Equal quantities of 0.010 M solutions of an acid HA and a 
base B are mixed
