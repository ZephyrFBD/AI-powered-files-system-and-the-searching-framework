How Viruses Infect Specific Organs
Glycoprotein and glycolipid patterns on the surfaces of cells give many viruses an opportunity for infection.
HIV and hepatitis viruses infect only specific organs or cells in the human body. HIV is able to penetrate
the plasma membranes of a subtype of lymphocytes called T-helper cells, as well as some monocytes and
central nervous system cells. The hepatitis virus attacks liver cells.
These viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that are
specific to and compatible with certain viruses (Figure 5.6). Other recognition sites on the virusâ€™s surface
interact with the human immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made
in response to the antigens or proteins associated with invasive pathogens, or in response to foreign cells,
such as might occur with an organ transplant. These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach and
