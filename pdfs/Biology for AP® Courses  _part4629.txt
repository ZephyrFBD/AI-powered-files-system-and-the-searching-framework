se energy conversions result in a loss of usable (free) energy through the release
of heat. In addition, matter cycles and recycles as it moves from organism to organism. We also have learned that the biotic
and abiotic components of an ecosystem interact. Autotrophs, chemoautotrophs, heterotrophs and decomposers comprise
the living components, whereas abiotic factors include nutrients, temperature, pH, availability of sunlight, and type of soil.
In this section, a variety of ways to depict this movement of energy through an ecosystem will be presented. Utilizing
multiple representations of data as well as understanding the movement of matter and energy through systems are significant
concepts in the AP速 Biology course.
Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 4 of the AP速
Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP速 Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent
foundation for the AP速 Biology course,
