larger (compare Figs. 20–42a and b).
We can now explain how a magnet can pick up unmagnetized pieces of iron
like paper clips. The magnet’s field causes a slight realignment of the domains in
the unmagnetized object so that it becomes a temporary magnet with its north pole
facing the south pole of the permanent magnet; thus, attraction results. Similarly,
elongated iron filings in a magnetic field acquire aligned domains and align them-
selves to reveal the shape of the magnetic field, Fig. 20–43.
An iron magnet can remain magnetized for a long time, and is referred to as
a “permanent magnet.” But if you drop a magnet on the floor or strike it with a
hammer, you can jar the domains into randomness and the magnet loses some or
all of its magnetism. Heating a permanent magnet can also cause loss of magnetism,
for raising the temperature increases the random thermal motion of atoms, which
tends to randomize the domains. Above a certain temperature known as the
Curie temperature (1043 K fo
