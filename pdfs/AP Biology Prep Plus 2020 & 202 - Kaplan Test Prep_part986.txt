 as flood, drought, hurricane,
or fire.
The impact of density-dependent factors on populations increases as the
number of individuals in the population, and therefore the density in a given
area, increases. These factors include competition among or between
species, predation, or emigration.
Density-independent factors aﬀect populations in the same way regardless of how
many individuals are in the population.
Density-dependent factors aﬀect populations diﬀerently as the number of individuals in
the population increases.
6. Scoring Guidelines for Free-Response Question 6
(a) Using the data, determine the optimum pH of pepsin. (1 point)
Determination (1 point)
Determination (1 point)
Here is a possible response that would receive full credit:
The optimum pH occurs when an enzyme is at maximum activity. Thus, the
optimum pH of pepsin is 2.
(b) Explain why the optimum pH is not the same for each enzyme. (1
