UNIT 8
Ecology
22
The Basics of Ecology
Learning Objectives
In this chapter, you will learn:
➜
How Organisms Respond to Changes in the Environment
➜
Energy Flow Through Ecosystems
Overview
The final unit in AP Biology brings together all that you have learned throughout the year in a discussion of ecology.
In this unit, you need to know how organisms use energy and matter and how energy flows through ecosystems. The
availability of energy (or lack thereof) in an ecosystem can determine the ecosystem’s survival or demise.
Ecosystems need to be able to adapt to disruptions in their environments. Communication among organisms is
essential and allows them to respond to disruptions in their environments. These responses can lead to changes in
populations and the evolution of populations. This chapter will first review how organisms respond to changes in
their environment followed by a discussion of the flow of energy through ecosystems.
