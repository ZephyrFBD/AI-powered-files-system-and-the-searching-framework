 reactor; (c) describe an additional problem or danger
associated with a breeder reactor.
2. Referring to Section 31–3, (a) why can small nuclei com-
bine to form larger ones, releasing energy in the process?
(b) Why does the first reaction in the proton–proton chain
limit the rate at which the Sun produces energy? (c) What
are the heaviest elements for which energy is released if
the elements are created by fusion of lighter elements?
(d) What keeps the Sun and stars together, allowing them
to sustain fusion? (e) What two methods are currently
being investigated to contain high-temperature plasmas on
the Earth to create fusion in the laboratory?
3. Deuterium makes up 0.0115% of natural hydrogen on
average. Make a rough estimate of the total deuterium in
the Earth’s oceans and estimate the total energy released
if all of it were used in fusion reactors.
4. The energy output of massive stars is believed to be due to
the carbon cycle (see text). (a) Show that no carbon is
consumed in thi
