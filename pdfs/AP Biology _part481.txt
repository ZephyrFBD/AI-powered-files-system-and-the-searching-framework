Which of the following predictions includes the most likely change
that will occur in the coloration of the moth population in the future
and provides the correct reasoning for that answer?
The coloration range will shift toward the darker colors as in
graph I because the predators will be able to find the darker

The coloration range will shift toward the extremes as in graph
II because more mid-range colored moths will be camouflaged.
The coloration range will become narrower as in graph III
because both the lighter and darker moths will be eaten more
often.
The coloration range will shift toward the lighter colors as in
graph IV because the predators will select moths that are
darker.
