es an
initiation complex with enhancers and
transcription factors. Also, the separation of the
DNA strand is different as histones are involved.
b.
The initiation step in prokaryotes requires an
initiation complex with enhancers and
transcription factors. Also, the separation of the
DNA strand is different as histones are involved.
c.
The elongation step in eukaryotes requires an
initiation complex with enhancers and
transcription factors. Also, the separation of the
DNA strand is different as histones are involved.
d.
The initiation step in eukaryotes requires an
initiation complex with enhancers and
transcription factors. Also, the separation of the
DNA strand is different as histones are not
involved.
35. Would you be able to determine which RNA
polymerase you isolated from a eukaryotic cell without
analyzing its products?
a.
No, because they have the same Î± -amanitin
sensitivity in all products.
b.
No, quantitative analysis of products is done to
determine the type of polymerase.
c
