tigen. Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in
the blood plasma and react with the A or B antigens, if the two are mixed. When type A and type B blood are
combined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood occurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with
the opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney causing kidney failure. Type O blood
has neither A or B antigens, and therefore, type O blood can be given to all blood types. Type O negative
blood is the universal donor. Type AB positive blood is the universal acceptor because it has both A and B
antigen. The ABO blood groups were discovered in 1900 and 1901 by Karl Landsteiner at the University of
Vienna.
The Rh blood group was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys. Most people have the Rh antigen (Rh+) and
do not have anti-Rh antibodies in their blood. The few people who do not have the Rh antigen and are
Rhâ€“ can develop anti-Rh antibodies if exposed to Rh+ blood. This can happen after a blood transfusio
