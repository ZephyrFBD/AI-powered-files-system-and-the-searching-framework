RESPONSE We have the reaction
The total number of
nucleons initially is
and the total charge is
The same
totals apply after the reaction. Hence the product nucleus must have 
and 
From the Periodic Table, we find that it is nitrogen that has
so the nucleus produced is 
EXERCISE A Determine the resulting nucleus in the reaction
Energy and momentum are also conserved in nuclear reactions, and can be
used to determine whether or not a given reaction can occur. For example, if the
total mass of the final products is less than the total mass of the initial particles,
this decrease in mass (recall 
) is converted to kinetic energy (
) of
the outgoing particles. But if the total mass of the products is greater than the
total mass of the initial reactants, the reaction requires energy. The reaction will
then not occur unless the bombarding particle has sufficient kinetic energy.
Consider a nuclear reaction of the general form
(31;1)
where particle a is a moving projectile particle (or
