on influences the genetic makeup of a population.
Part I: Artificial Selection of a Trait
1. Choose a trait upon which to carry out artificial selection. In order for selection to work—that is, to change the
genetic makeup of populations of subsequent generations—the trait must be heritable. If available, examine
Wisconsin Fast Plants. Consider trichome density, the color intensity of pigments in leaves, or plant height.
2. Select the plants with the trait of interest. If you choose trichome density, decide whether you want higher or
lower density. Select 10% of the class population of plants (12-15 plants) that possess the trait.
3. Among the selected plants, measure the trait. For example, count and record a sample number of trichomes in a
specific position on a specific leaf (same leaf in every plant).
4. Allow the selected plants to flower. Cross-pollinate the flowers and collect the seeds when the fruits mature.
 
5. Plant the seeds from the first generation to start the second ge
