s twice as many cations as anions,  
consistent with the formulation K2SO4.
Check Notice that the net charge in the diagram is zero, as it must 
be if it is to represent an ionic substance.

▶Practice Exercise 1
If you have an aqueous solution that contains 1.5 moles of 
HCl, how many moles of ions are in the solution?  
(a) 1.0 (b) 1.5 (c) 2.0 (d) 2.5 (e) 3.0
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
If you were to draw diagrams representing aqueous solutions of 
(a) NiSO4, (b) Ca1NO322, (c) Na3PO4, (d) Al21SO423, how many 
anions would you show if each diagram contained six cations?

CHAPTER 4 Reactions in Aqueous Solution
4.2 ∣ Precipitation Reactions
Figure 4.4 shows two clear solutions being mixed. One solution contains potassium 
iodide, KI, dissolved in water, and the other contains lead nitrate, Pb1NO322, dis-
solved in water. The reaction between these two solutes produces a water-insoluble 
yellow solid. Reactions that result in the formation of an insoluble pro
