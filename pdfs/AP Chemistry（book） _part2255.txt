start by examining the rate laws of 
elementary reactions.
Elementary reactions are significant in a very important way: If a reaction is elemen-
tary, its rate law is based directly on its molecularity. For example, consider the unimolecular 
reaction
 
A ยก products 
As the number of A molecules increases, the number that reacts in a given time interval 
increases proportionally. Thus, the rate of a unimolecular process is first order:
 
Rate = k3A4 
For bimolecular elementary steps, the rate law is second order, as in the reaction
 
A + B ยก products  Rate = k3A43B4 
The second-order rate law follows directly from collision theory. If we double the concen-
tration of A, the number of collisions between the molecules of A and B doubles; likewise, 
if we double [B], the number of collisions between A and B doubles. Therefore, the rate law 
is first order in both [A] and [B] and second order overall.
The rate laws for all feasible elementary reactions are given in Table 14.3. Notice how
