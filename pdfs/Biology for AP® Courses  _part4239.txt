ter Biomes
Freshwater biomes include lakes and ponds (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing water). They also include
wetlands, which will be discussed later. Humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water,
crop irrigation, sanitation, and industry. These various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services. Lakes
and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are, therefore, connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these
terrestrial biomes.
Lakes and Ponds
Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important
abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds
occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can
penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are
