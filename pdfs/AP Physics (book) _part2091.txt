ral, so the net charge there must still be zero. The 
on the left plate of 
attracts a charge of 
on the opposite plate. Because region A must have a zero
net charge, there is 
on the left plate of 
The same considerations apply to
the other capacitors, so we see that the charge on each capacitor plate has the same
magnitude Q. A single capacitor that could replace these three in series without
affecting the circuit (that is, Q and V the same) would have a capacitance 
where
The total voltage V across the three capacitors in series must equal the sum of the
voltages across each capacitor:
We also have for each capacitor
and
so we
substitute for 
and V into the last equation and get
or
[series] (19;6)
Notice that the equivalent capacitance 
is smaller than the smallest contributing
capacitance. Notice also that the forms of the equations for capacitors in series or
in parallel are the reverse of their counterparts for resistance. That is, the formula
for capacitors in series resembles t
