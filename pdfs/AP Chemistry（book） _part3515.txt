CHAPTER 22 Chemistry of the Nonmetals
22.4 ∣ Group 7A: The Halogens
The elements of group 7A, the halogens, have the outer-electron configuration ns2np5, 
where n ranges from 2 through 6. The halogens have large negative electron affinities 
 (Section 7.5), and they most often achieve a noble-gas configuration by gaining an 
electron, which results in a -1 oxidation state. Fluorine, being the most electronegative 
element, exists in compounds only in the -1 state. The other halogens exhibit positive 
oxidation states up to +7 in combination with more electronegative atoms such as O. 
In the positive oxidati
