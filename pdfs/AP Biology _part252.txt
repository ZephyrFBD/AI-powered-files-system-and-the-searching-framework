(B) A is the double outer membrane of the chloroplast. B is the
stroma, which is the site of the light-independent reactions. C is the
grana, which contain thylakoid membranes and carry out the light-
dependent reactions, including photolysis. D is the inner membrane,
but no relevant reactions occur there. Cyclic photophosphorylation
occurs in the light-dependent reactionâ€”in the grana at C. (ENE-1 &
SYI-1)
(B) B is the stroma, which is where the light-independent reactions
occur. This is also where the Calvin cycle occurs and where PGAL
or G3P is produced. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they
all relate to the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the grana
at C. (ENE-1 & SYI-1)
(A) ATP is produced in the light-dependent reactions of the grana,
which is where you find photosystems and electron transport chains.
The matches in choices B, C, and D are all incorrect. (ENE-1 &
SYI-1)
(D) This experiment was a brilliant one. As cells carry out
