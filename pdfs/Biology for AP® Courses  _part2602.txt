 In stems, the
xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle; in roots, this is termed the vascular stele or vascular
cylinder.
Figure 23.3 This light micrograph shows a cross section of a squash (Curcurbita maxima) stem. Each teardrop-shaped
vascular bundle consists of large xylem vessels toward the inside and smaller phloem cells toward the outside. Xylem
cells, which transport water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant, are dead at functional maturity. Phloem
cells, which transport sugars and other organic compounds from photosynthetic tissue to the rest of the plant, are
living. The vascular bundles are encased in ground tissue and surrounded by dermal tissue. (credit: modification of
