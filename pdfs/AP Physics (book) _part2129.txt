sn’t change 
significantly when different voltage scales are selected. A 
digital meter
draws very little current when connected across even a 
resistance.
The precision of digital meters is exceptional, often one part in 
or better. This precision is not the same as accuracy, however. A precise meter of
internal resistance 
will not give accurate results if used to measure a voltage
across a 
resistor—in which case it is necessary to do a calculation like that in
Example 19–17.

A device that transforms another type of energy into electrical
energy is called a source of emf. A battery behaves like a source
of emf in series with an internal resistance. The emf is
