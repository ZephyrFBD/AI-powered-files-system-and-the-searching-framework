at the mirror image of the isomer is identical to the 
original. Consequently trans-3Co(en)2Cl24+ does not exhibit opti-
cal isomerism.
Analyze We are given the chemical formula for two geometric 
isomers and asked to determine whether either one has optical 
isomers. Because en is a bidentate ligand, we know that both  
complexes are octahedral and both have coordination  
number 6.
Plan We need to sketch the structures of the cis and trans isomers 
and their mirror images. We can draw the en ligand as two N at-
oms connected by an arc. If the mirror image cannot be superim-
posed on the original structure, the complex and its mirror image 
are optical isomers.
 
▶Practice Exercise 1
Which of the following complexes has an optical isomer? 
(a) Tetrahedral 3CdBr2Cl242- (b) Octahedral 3CoCl4(en)42-  
(c) Octahedral 3Co(NH3)4Cl242+ (d) Tetrahedral 
3Co(NH3)BrClI4-
 
▶Practice Exercise 2
Does the square-planar complex ion 3Pt(NH3)(N3)ClBr4- have 
optical isomers? Explain your answer.
