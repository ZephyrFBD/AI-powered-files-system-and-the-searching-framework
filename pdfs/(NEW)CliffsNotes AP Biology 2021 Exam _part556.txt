O to H2CO3.
 
Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus, thereby maximizing hemoglobin
 
content and thus maximizing their ability to transport O2.
 
2. White blood cells, or leukocytes, consist of various disease-fighting cells that defend the body against infection.
 
3. Platelets are cell fragments that are involved in blood clotting. 4. Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood that
contains various dissolved substances.
 
Blood clotting is an example of a positive feedback mechanism. A brief description of the sequence of events
follows:
1. Platelets adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel and release various substances that initiate a cascade of
reactions, some of which attract additional platelets.
2. Additional platelets arrive that, in turn, release substances that attract still more platelets (positive feedback).
 
3. Fibrinogen, dissolved in the blood, is converted to its active and solid form, fibrin.
 
4. Threads of fibrin protein bind platelets together to form a netwo
