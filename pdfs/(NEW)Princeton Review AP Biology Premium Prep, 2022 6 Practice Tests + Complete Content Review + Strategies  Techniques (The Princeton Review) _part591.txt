D
Snorflak and Fixxels, (D), would have the most shared derived characters because they have the fewest
amino acid differences. Snippeiq and Sqellert would be expected to have the least since they are so
different, which rules out (A). Sqellert and Gerdellen, (B), were close with only 4 differences but still not
as low as Snorflak and Fixxels. Snorflak and Gerdellen, (C), must be an intermediate with 9 differences
observed in the table.

B
The two most closely related organisms are the two with the most shared derived characteristics.
58.
D
Shared derived characteristics are newly evolved traits that are shared with every group on a phylogenic
tree except for one. Vertebral columns are present in every group except for the sea anemone, so it must
have evolved first. Walking legs are found only in the salamander, indicating that it most likely evolved
most recently.

C
Pre-zygotic barriers to reproduction are those that prevent fertilization, so you can eliminate (A), (B), and
(D)
