lant parts returns through air spaces to the leaves where it exits
through stomata. Air spaces also serve to maintain buoyancy in the plants.
Control of Stomata
Each stoma is surrounded by two guard cells. The cell walls of guard cells are not of uniform thickness. Instead, the
cell wall that borders the stoma is thicker than the rest of the cell wall. In addition, the cellulose microfibrils are
arranged radially, that is, they encircle the guard cell from the stoma side to the outside. When water diffuses into a
guard cell, the guard cell expands. But because of the nonuniform and radially constructed cell wall, the expansion is
distorted in such a way that most of the expansion is realized by the bulging out of the thinner wall, the wall away
from the stoma. The overall effect is to produce two kidney-shaped guard cells that create an opening, the stoma,
between them. When water diffuses out of the guard cells, the kidney shape collapses and the stoma closes. The
