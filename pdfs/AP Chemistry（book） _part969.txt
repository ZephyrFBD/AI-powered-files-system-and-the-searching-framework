arrangement represents a very stable configuration, as is evidenced by the chemical 
inertness of helium.
Lithium The electron configurations of lithium and several elements that follow it in 
the periodic table are shown in Table 6.3. For the third electron of lithium, the change

in the principal quantum number from n = 1 for the first two electrons to n = 2 for 
the third electron represents a large jump in energy and a corresponding jump in the 
average distance of the electron from the nucleus. In other words, it represents the 
start of a new shell occupied with electrons. As you can see by examining the periodic 
table, lithium starts a new row of the table. It is th
