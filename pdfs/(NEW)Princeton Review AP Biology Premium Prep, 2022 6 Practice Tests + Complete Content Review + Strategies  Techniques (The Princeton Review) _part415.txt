Each species produces more offspring than can survive.
Offspring compete with each other for limited resources.
Organisms in every population vary.
The offspring with the most favorable traits are most likely to survive and reproduce.
Evidence for evolution includes:
fossils
biogeography
comparison of developmental embryology
comparative anatomy, including homologous and analogous structures
molecular biology (sequences of genes are conserved across many types of species)
Members of a species are defined by the ability to reproduce fertile offspring.
Evolution and speciation occur when environmental pressures favor traits that permit survival and reproduction
of selected individuals in a varied population. The favored traits may evolve to cause divergent or convergent
evolution.
Adaptations are random variations in traits that end up being selected for until they become prominent in the
population.
Genetic drift occurs when a populationâ€™s traits change due to random events rather than
