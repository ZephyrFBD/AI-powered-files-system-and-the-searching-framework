itional step in pre-mRNA processing? One
possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-
based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ
depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from
a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.
In eukaryotes, pre-mRNAs are processed to form mature mRNAs. How does the mRNA editing that occurs in
Trypanosoma brucei differ from mRNA processing that occurs in all eukaryotes?
a.
mRNA editing changes the coding sequence of the mRNA, but mRNA processing does not.
b.
mRNA editing splices out noncoding RNA, but mRNA processing does not.
c.
mRNA editing adds a cap of 5’-methylguanosine to the mRNA, but mRNA processing does not.
d.
mRNA editing adds a 3’ poly-A tail, but mRNA processing does not.
