genetics.

3.17 The student is able to describe representations of an appropriate example of
inheritance patterns that cannot be explained by Mendel’s model of the inheritance of traits.
The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for
the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:

Mendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four postulates, some of which are sometimes called
“laws,” that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms. As you have learned, more
complex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not exhibit the
